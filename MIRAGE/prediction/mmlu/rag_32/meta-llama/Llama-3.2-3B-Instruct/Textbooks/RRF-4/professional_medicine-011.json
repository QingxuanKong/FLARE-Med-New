The patient presents with a low-grade fever, nonproductive cough, and patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray, which suggests a respiratory infection. The patient is a previously healthy individual, and the symptoms have been present for 7 days, which is a relatively mild course. The patient's temperature is 37.7\u00b0C (99.9\u00b0F), which is within the normal range, and the patient has been able to continue daily activities, indicating that the infection is not severe. The scattered inspiratory crackles heard in the thorax and the patchy infiltrates on the chest X-ray suggest an interstitial or bronzilary pattern, which is consistent with viral pneumonia or bronchiolitis. The patient's age and symptoms suggest that the most likely cause of the illness is a viral infection, such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Purulent-appearing sputum should be sent for routine bacterial culture and, in certain circumstances, mycobacterial culture as well.

According to studies of healthy individuals 18\u201340 years of age, the mean oral temperature is 36.8\u00b0 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0 \u00b1 0.7\u00b0F), with low levels at 6 a.m. and higher levels at 4\u20136 p.m. The maximal normal oral temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F) at 6 a.m. and 37.7\u00b0C (99.9\u00b0F) at 4 p.m.; these values define the 99th percentile for healthy individuals. In light of these studies, an a.m. temperature of >37.2\u00b0C (>98.9\u00b0F) or a p.m. temperature of >37.7\u00b0C (>99.9\u00b0F) would define a fever. The normal daily temperature variation is typically 0.5\u00b0C (0.9\u00b0F). However, in some individuals recovering from a febrile illness, this daily variation can be as great as 1.0\u00b0C. During a febrile illness, the diurnal variation is usually maintained, but"

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm. Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed. Laboratory findings include a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 24.9 \u03bcIU/mL"

A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid.

Patients with apparently uncomplicated influenza have been reported to have a variety of mild ventilatory defects and increased alveolar-capillary diffusion gradients; thus, subclinical pulmonary involvement may be more common than is appreciated. In uncomplicated influenza, the acute illness generally resolves over 2\u20135 days, and most patients have largely recovered in 1 week, although cough may persist 1\u20132 weeks longer. In a significant minority (particularly the elderly), however, symptoms of weakness or lassitude (postinfluenza asthenia) may persist for several weeks and may prove troublesome for persons who wish to resume their full level of activity promptly. The pathogenetic basis for this asthenia is unknown, although pulmonary function abnormalities may persist for several weeks after uncomplicated influenza."

In severe exacerbations, patients may be so breathless that they are unable to complete sentences and may become cyanotic. Examination usually shows increased ventilation, hyperinflation, and tachycardia. Pulsus paradoxus may be present, but this is rarely a useful clinical sign. There is a marked fall in spirometric values and PEF. Arterial blood gases on air show hypoxemia, and PCO2 is usually low due to hyperventilation. A normal or rising PCO2 is an indication of impending respiratory failure and requires immediate monitoring and therapy. A chest roentgenogram is not usually informative but may show pneumonia or pneumothorax."
