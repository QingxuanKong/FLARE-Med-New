    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the relationship between the level of spinal cord damage and the potential effects on breathing. The question states that the damage is at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra. According to the provided documents, the level of the spinal cord damage and, by implication, the level of disruption of the spinal column, can be determined from clinical findings. Diaphragmatic paralysis occurs with lesions of the upper three cervical segments (C1-C3). Complete paralysis of the arms and legs usually indicates a fracture or dislocation at the fourth to fifth cervical vertebrae. Paralysis of the legs and only the hands but not the proximal arms indicates a lesion at the fifth to sixth cervical level. Since the patient has damage at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra, breathing should be affected as the phrenic nerve, which arises from C3, C4, and C5, is involved. Therefore, the patient may experience respiratory problems. Now let's analyze the options: A. They will be unable to breathe without life support. B. They will only be able to breathe quietly. C. It is impossible to predict an effect on breathing. D. Breathing will be unaffected. Given the level of damage at C6, breathing will likely be affected, making option D incorrect. Between A and B, option A is more likely as the phrenic nerve is involved, which is above the level of damage, and the patient may experience respiratory problems. However, breathing may not be completely impossible without life support, so option B is also possible. Between A and B, option A is more accurate as breathing may be severely affected, and life support may be necessary. Option C is incorrect as it is possible to predict the effect on breathing based on the level of damage. Therefore, the most accurate answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

The most hazardous complication of ankylosing spondylitis is compression of the cord from seemingly minor trauma that has resulted in fracture\u2013dislocation of the cervical (or lumbar) vertebrae. Fox and colleagues treated 31 such patients in a 5-year period; the majority of unstable fractures that required surgical fixation were in the cervical region, and several patients had fracture\u2013dislocations at two levels. The instability at the upper spinal levels may be difficult to detect radiologically, and caution should be observed in allowing patients to resume full activity after a neck injury if the cervical spine is involved by ankylosing spondylitis. Careful flexion and extension radiograph views usually, but not always, demonstrate the instability."

Industrial accidents most often involved the thoracolumbar vertebrae. Impact to the head with the neck flexed or sharply retroflexed, as mentioned earlier, was the main cause of injuries to the cervical region. These are not only the most mobile portions of the vertebral column but also the regions in which the cervical and lumbar enlargements of the cord greatly reduce the space between neural and bony structures. The thoracic cord is relatively small and its spinal canal is capacious; additional protection is provided by the high and overlapping articular facets, making dislocation difficult, and by limitations in anterior displacement"

The cervical vertebrae are forced together at the level of maximum stress, driving the anteroinferior edge of the upper vertebral body into the one below, sometimes splitting it in two. The posterior part of the fractured body is displaced backward and compresses the cord. Concomitantly, there is tearing of the interspinous and posterior longitudinal ligaments. Less severe degrees of anteroflexion injury produce only dislocation of adjacent cervical vertebrae at one of several levels. Vulnerability to the effects of anteroflexion (and to some extent to retroflexion injuries) is increased by the presence of cervical spondylosis or ankylosing spondylitis that narrow the canal or by a congenital narrowness of the spinal canal."

In these instances, the spinal cord damage, which can be minor or profound and permanent, is considered to be caused by a sudden inward bulge of the ligamentum flavum or by transient dislocation at the time of injury which, is permitted because of ligamentous disruption; when viewed with imaging studies, the vertebral bodies are found to have spontaneously realigned. In such cases, rupture of the supporting ligamentous elements and spinal instability can be revealed by gentle flexion and extension of the neck under radiologic observation, which demonstrates movement of the vertebra in relation to an adjacent one.

When the spinal canal is developmentally narrow in its anteroposterior dimension at one or several points, the space available for the spinal cord becomes insufficient. A small canal certainly makes an individual more subject to the compressive effects of spondylosis. The range acquired of narrowing of the canal that produces symptomatic cervical spondylosis is generally from 7 to 12 mm (normal canal diameter: 17 to 18 mm). Consequently, one must consider several additional mechanisms by which the cord might be damaged. The effects of the natural motions of the spinal cord during flexion and extension of the neck are probably important in this respect. Adams and Logue confirmed the observation of O\u2019Connell that, during full flexion and extension of the neck, the cervical cord and dura move up and down.

Nevertheless, in rare instances, quadriparesis, temporary or permanent, results from a violent whiplash injury.

If the traumatic incident disrupts craniocervical stability, the chances of a significant spinal cord injury are extremely high. The consequences are quadriplegia. In addition, respiratory function may be compromised by paralysis of the phrenic nerve (which arises from spinal nerves C3 to C5), and severe hypotension (low blood pressure) may result from central disruption of the sympathetic part of the autonomic division of the nervous system."

            "content": "Mid and lower cervical vertebral column disruption may produce a range of complex neurological problems involving the upper and lower limbs, although below the level of C5, respiratory function is unlikely to be compromised. Lumbar vertebral column injuries are rare. When they occur, they usually involve significant force. Knowing that a significant force is required to fracture a vertebra, one must assess the abdominal organs and the rest of the axial skeleton for further fractures and visceral rupture. Vertebral injuries may also involve the soft tissues and supporting structures between the vertebrae. Typical examples of this are the unifacetal and bifacetal cervical vertebral dislocations that occur in hyperflexion injuries. The pars interarticularis is a clinical term to describe the specific region of a vertebra between the superior and inferior facet (zygapophysial) joints (Fig. 2.40A). This region is susceptible to trauma, especially in athletes."

The same risk factors for serious causes of low back pain also apply to neck pain with the additional feature that neurologic signs of myelopathy (incontinence, sensory level, spastic legs) may also occur. Lhermitte\u2019s sign, an electrical shock down the spine with neck flexion, suggests involvement of the cervical spinal cord."

            "content": "The initial symptoms of structural diseases of the cord that evolve over days or weeks are focal neck or back pain, followed by various combinations of paresthesias, sensory loss, motor weakness, and sphincter disturbance. There may be only mild sensory symptoms or a devastating functional transection of the cord. Partial lesions selectively involve the posterior columns or anterior spinothalamic tracts or are limited to one side of the cord. Paresthesias or numbness typically begins in the feet and ascend symmetrically or asymmetrically. These symptoms simulate a polyneuropathy, but a sharply demarcated spinal cord level indicates the myelopathic nature of the process. In severe and abrupt cases, areflexia reflecting spinal shock may be present, but hyperreflexia supervenes over days or weeks; persistent areflexic paralysis with a sensory level usually indicates necrosis over multiple segments of the spinal cord.

            "content": "A special type of spinal cord injury, occurring most often in wartime, is one in which a high-velocity missile penetrates the vertebral canal and damages the spinal cord directly. In some cases the missile strikes the vertebral column without entering the spinal canal but due to the shock wave, disrupts and virtually shatters the intradural contents or produces lesser degrees of spinal cord dysfunction. Or, the transmitted shock wave from a bullet passing nearby the vertebral column causes paralysis of spinal cord function that is largely reversible in a day or two (spinal cord concussion, which is described further on)."

Postmortem examination revealed extensive myelomalacia as a result of occlusions of numerous spinal vessels by emboli of nucleus pulposus material. The clinical picture is essentially one of spinal apoplexy; after spinal trauma of even mild degree the patient experiences the abrupt onset of pain in the back or neck, accompanied by the signs of a transverse cord lesion affecting all sensory, motor, and sphincteric functions and evolving over a period of a few minutes to 1 h or more. Occasionally, the syndrome spares the posterior columns, thus simulating an anterior spinal artery occlusion. The CSF is normal. As with other types of cord infarction, the changes may not appear on MRI for a day or more."
