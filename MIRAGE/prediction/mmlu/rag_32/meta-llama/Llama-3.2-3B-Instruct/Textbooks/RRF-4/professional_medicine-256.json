Given this information, the most appropriate course of action would be to treat the symptoms, as the patient does not have any clear indications for further diagnostic testing or referral to a specialist at this point. The patient's symptoms are likely self-limiting and may resolve on their own. The other options, such as determining serum IgE concentration or total eosinophil count, may be more appropriate if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, or if there are other signs of an underlying condition that requires further investigation. Referral to an allergist may also be necessary if the patient's symptoms persist or recur, but it is not the first step in management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

A notable exception is IgE-mediated urticaria and anaphylaxis that need presensitization and develop a few minutes to a few hours after rechallenge. Characteristic times of onset to drug reaction are as follows: 4\u201314 days for morbilliform eruptions, 2\u20134 days for AGEP, 5\u201328 days for SJS/TEN, and 14\u201348 days for DIHS. A drug chart, compiling information of all current and past medications/ supplements and the timing of administration relative to the rash, is a key diagnostic tool to identifying the inciting drug. Medications introduced for the first time in the relevant time frame are prime suspects. Two other important elements to suspect causality at this stage are (1) previous experience with the drug in the population and (2) alternative etiologic candidates."

It is characterized by an urticarial reaction localized to the site of skin trauma. It has been suggested that trauma induces an IgE-mediated reaction causing histamine to be released from the mast cells. Cholinergic urticaria, characterized by the appearance of 1to 3-mm wheals surrounded by large erythematous flares after an increase in core body temperature, occurs commonly in young adults. Lesions may develop during strenuous exercise, after a hot bath, or emotional stress. The lack of airway symptoms differentiates it from exercise-induced anaphylaxis."

Although not life-threatening, severe pruritus and the social embarrassment of urticaria can compromise quality of life.

Patients with recurrent angioedema without urticaria should be evaluated for HAE (Table 81-5). Measurement of the mast cell mediators, histamine and tryptase, may be helpful when the diagnosis of anaphylaxis isin question. A tryptase level is a more useful test because histamine is released quickly, has a short half-life, and is often difficult to detect in the serum. Serum tryptase levels peak 1 to 1.5 hours after anaphylaxis. Elevated levels may be helpful in Figure 81-1 Examples of urticaria.

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

Hypocomplementemia is not observed in IgE-mediated mast cell disease and may reflect either an acquired abnormality generally attributed to the formation of immune complexes or a genetic or acquired deficiency of C1INH. Chronic recurrent urticaria, generally in females, associated with arthralgias, an elevated sedimentation rate, and normo-or hypocomplementemia suggests an underlying cutaneous necrotizing angiitis.

Which of the eicosanoid agonists have been demonstrated to reduce both morbidity and mortality in patients with such a diagnosis? What are the modes of action? A 40-year-old woman presented to her doctor with a 6-month history of increasing shortness of breath. This was associated with poor appetite and ankle swell-ing.

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

            "content": "Treat with systemic antihistamines. Topical medications are of no benefit. Maintain a high suspicion for a cutaneous drug reaction in patients who are hospitalized and develop rashes. Such reactions can take many forms, including urticarial, lupus-like, vasculitic, purpuric, lichenoid, and vesicular. Drugs can cause all four types of hypersensitivity reactions, and sometimes the same drug may cause different types of reactions in different patients. Eruptions occur 7\u201314 days after exposure, so if a patient reacts within a day or two of starting a new drug (i.e., a drug they have never taken before), that drug is probably not the causative agent. Eruptions are generally widespread, relatively symmetrical, and pruritic. Most are relatively short-lived, disappearing within 1\u20132 weeks following removal of the offending agent."
