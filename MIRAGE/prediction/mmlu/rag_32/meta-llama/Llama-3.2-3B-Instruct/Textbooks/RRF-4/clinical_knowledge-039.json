    "predict": "To calculate the rate of energy expenditure, we need to know the respiratory quotient (RQ) of the individual. Since the question doesn't provide the RQ, we can use a typical value for a male athlete, which is around 0.82 (this value is based on a typical diet and metabolic rate). The rate of energy expenditure (EE) can be calculated using the following formula: EE = V\u02d9O2 x RQ Where: - V\u02d9O2 is the rate of oxygen consumption (2 L/min) - RQ is the respiratory quotient (0.82) EE = 2 L/min x 0.82 EE = 1.64 L/min Since 1 L of oxygen consumption is approximately equal to 24.45 kJ (based on the respiratory quotient), we can convert the rate of energy expenditure to kJ/min: EE = 1.64 L/min x 24.45 kJ/L EE \u2248 40.26 kJ/min Rounding to the nearest answer choice, the rate of energy expenditure is approximately 40 kJ/min.

The efficiency of the heart as a pump is relatively low. During physical exercise, efficiency improves because mean blood pressure does not change appreciably, whereas cardiac output and work increase considerably, without a proportional increase in myocardial O2 consumption. Of interest is that the chemical efficiency of the heart is rather high, as indicated by the estimate of 60% for the efficiency of generating ATP from oxidative phosphorylation. The energy expended in cardiac metabolism that does not contribute to the propulsion of blood through the body appears in the form of heat. The energy of flowing blood is also dissipated as heat."

In the normal heart, the rate of ATP hydrolysis is matched by the rate of ATP synthesis. ATP is generated by oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids and glucose, a process that requires O2. When the rate of ATP hydrolysis increases, as during exercise, the consumption of O2 for oxidative phosphorylation also increases. The rate of O2 utilization is thereby coupled to the rate of cardiac work. The myocardium functions only aerobically, and in general it uses substrates in proportion to their arterial concentration."

It can increase severalfold during exercise and decrease moderately in such conditions as hypotension and hypothermia. The O2 content of cardiac venous blood is normally low (\u22485 mL/ dL), and the myocardium can receive little additional O2 by further extraction of O2 from coronary blood.

            "content": "Exercise is remarkable because of the lack of significant changes in blood gases. Except at maximal exertion, changes in PaCO2 and PaO2 are minimal during exercise. Arterial pH remains within normal values during moderate exercise. During strenuous exercise, arterial pH begins to fall as lactic acid is liberated from muscles during anaerobic metabolism. This decrease in arterial pH stimulates ventilation that is out of proportion to the level of exercise. The level of exercise at which sustained metabolic (lactic) acidosis begins is called the anaerobic threshold (see Fig. 25.7 Abnormalities in the Control of Breathing"

            "content": "Total energy expenditure comprises resting energy expenditure, activity energy expenditure, and the thermal effect of feeding (Chap. 97). Resting energy expenditure accounts for two-thirds of total energy expenditure, activity energy expenditure for one-fourth to one-third, and the thermal effect of feeding for ~10%. For normally nourished, healthy individuals, the total energy expenditure is ~30\u201335 kcal/kg. Critical illness increases resting energy expenditure, but this increase is significant only in initially well-nourished individuals with a robust SRI who experience, for example, severe multiple trauma, extensive burns, sepsis, sustained high fever, or closed head injury. In these situations, total energy expenditure can reach 40\u201345 kcal/kg. The chronically starved patient with adapted PEM has a reduced energy expenditure and is inactive, with a usual total energy expenditure of ~20\u201325 kcal/kg. Very few patients with adapted PEM require as much as 30 kcal/kg for energy balance."

            "content": "Limitation of the O2 supply could be caused by inadequate oxygenation of blood in the lungs or limitation of the supply of O2-laden blood to the muscles. Failure by the lungs to oxygenate blood fully can be ruled out because even with the most strenuous exercise at sea level, arterial blood is fully saturated with O2. Therefore, O2 delivery to the active muscles (or blood flow because the arterial blood O2 content is normal) appears to be the limiting factor in muscle performance. This limitation could be caused by the inability to increase cardiac output beyond a critical level. In turn, this inability is caused by a limitation in stroke volume because the heart rate reaches maximal levels before maximal V\u02dcO2 is reached. Hence, the major factor that limits muscle performance is the pumping capacity of the heart."
