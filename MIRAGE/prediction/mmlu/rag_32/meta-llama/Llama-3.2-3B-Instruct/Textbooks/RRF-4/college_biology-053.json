ZP3 is a glycoprotein in the zona pellucida that binds to sperm receptors on the surface of sperm, initiating the acrosomal reaction and allowing sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida. The question asks for the experimental observation that would NOT be expected to block in vitro fertilization (IVF). Let's evaluate each option: \\n\\n Option A: Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 would block the binding of sperm to ZP3, preventing the acrosomal reaction and thus inhibiting fertilization. This would indeed block IVF. \\n\\n Option B: Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing with eggs would allow sperm to bind to ZP3, initiating the acrosomal reaction and facilitating fertilization. This would not block IVF.\\n\\n Option C: Incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 would prevent ZP3 from interacting with sperm, blocking the acrosomal reaction and preventing fertilization. This would indeed block IVF.\\n\\n Option D: Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, would not affect the binding of sperm to ZP3 in the zona pellucida. ZP2 is a secondary sperm-binding protein, and its presence on the beads would not interfere with the ZP3-sperm interaction.

Capacitation is complete when spermatozoa are able to bind to the zona pellucida receptors.

Cell and Tissue Biology: A Textbook of Histology, 6th ed. Baltimore: Urban & Schwarzenberg, 1988.) proacrosomal granules, rich in glycoproteins, coalesce into a membrane-bounded vesicle, the acrosomal vesicle, adjacent to the nuclear envelope. The vesicle enlarges and its contents increase during this phase. The position of the acrosomal vesicle determines the anterior pole of the developing sperm. Also during this phase, the centrioles migrate from the juxtanuclear region to the posterior pole of the spermatid, where the mature centriole aligns at right angles to the plasma membrane. The centriole initiates the assembly of the nine peripheral microtubule doublets and two central"

            "content": "Healthy Sertoli cell function is essential for sperm cell viability and development. In addition, spermatogenesis is absolutely dependent on testosterone produced by peritubular Leydig cells (see The Leydig Cell ), yet it is the Sertoli cells that express the androgen receptor and respond to testosterone, not the developing sperm cells. Similarly the pituitary hormone follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is also required for maximal sperm production, and again it is the Sertoli cell that expresses the FSH receptor, not the developing sperm. Thus these hormones support spermatogenesis indirectly through stimulation of Sertoli cell function."

Early embryogenesis (up to day 6 after fertilization) occurs in the oviduct and gives rise to a blastocyst that hatches from the zona pellucida. 28. The placenta develops from the outer extraembryonic trophoblast. The endocrine function of the placenta includes production of hCG, progesterone, estrogens, and placental lactogen. Estrogen production requires placental cells (syncytiotrophoblasts) as well as the fetal adrenal and liver\u2014collectively called the fetoplacental unit. 29."

These changes include \u0081 condensation of nuclear DNA. The head of the sperm decreases in size. \u0081 further reduction of cytoplasm. The sperm cells become more slender. \u0081 changes in plasma membrane lipids, proteins, and glycosy lation. \u0081 alterations in the outer acrosomal membrane (decapacita tion). The surface-associated decapacitation factor is added to inhibit the fertilizing ability of the sperm cells (page 803)."
