He appears reluctant to remove his shirt for the examination, and says that he is embarrassed because he has grown breasts during the past year. He is at the 50th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows bilateral 1.5-cm fibroglandular masses located beneath the nipple-areolar complex and normal penis and testes. Pubic hair development is Tanner stage 3.

The boy is reluctant to remove his shirt and has grown breasts over the past year, indicating gynecomastia. The physical examination reveals bilateral 1.5-cm fibroglandular masses located beneath the nipple-areolar complex and normal penis and testes. Pubic hair development is Tanner stage 3, indicating that the boy is in the early stages of puberty. Serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within the reference ranges, which suggests that the hormonal imbalance is not due to a problem with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The presence of fibroglandular breast tissue is a key finding, as it suggests that the breast tissue is responding to estrogen, but the testes are not producing sufficient androgens to suppress the growth of breast tissue. This is consistent with a condition known as gynecomastia, which can be caused by an imbalance of sex hormones. Given the normal pubic hair development and the presence of fibroglandular breast tissue, the most likely cause of the boy's breast enlargement is normal development. The boy is at the 50th percentile for height and weight, and his pubertal development is consistent with normal puberty. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Normal development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Affected patients have a 46,XY karyotype, normally formed testes (usually located in the inguinal canal or labia majora), and female external genitalia with a short vagina and no internal m\u00fcllerian structures. At the time of puberty, testosterone concentrations increase to normal or above normal male range.

If organic causes are not found, one is left with the diagnosis of idiopathic central precocity. Patients with high testosterone but suppressed LH concentrations have gonadotropin-independent sexual precocity; in these patients, DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) and 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone should be measured. High levels of testosterone and 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone suggest the possibility of CAH due to 21\u03b1-hydroxylase or 11\u03b2-hydroxylase deficiency. If testosterone and DHEAS are elevated, adrenal tumors should be excluded by obtaining a computed tomography (CT)"

            "content": "See Chap. 410. The onset and tempo of puberty varies greatly in the general population and is affected by genetic and environmental factors. Although some of the variance in the timing of puberty is explained by heritable factors, the genes involved remain unknown. Puberty in boys before age 9 is considered precocious. Isosexual precocity refers to premature sexual development consistent with phenotypic sex and includes features such as the development of facial hair and phallic growth. Isosexual precocity is divided into gonadotropindependent and gonadotropin-independent causes of androgen excess (Table 411-1). Heterosexual precocity refers to the premature development of estrogenic features in boys, such as breast development."

The examining physician discovers postural hypotension and moderate vitiligo (depigmented areas of skin) and obtains routine blood tests. She finds hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis and suspects Addison\u2019s disease. She performs a standard ACTH 1\u201324 stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response compatible with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency. The diagnosis of autoimmune Addison\u2019s disease is made, and the patient must start replacement of the hormones he cannot produce himself. How should this patient be treated? What precautions should he take?"

In both cases, as is true of most such patients, pubertal development had been completed and menses initiated before anorexia led to marked weight loss. Fear of obesity, a syndrome of self-induced malnutrition common among teenage gymnasts and ballet dancers, may slow growth and delay pubertal development (63). These children voluntarily reduce their caloric intake as much as 40%, leading to nutritional growth retardation. An additive role for endurance training in the delayed development is possible, but the mechanisms are unclear at this point. These conditions are essentially severe forms of hypothalamic amenorrhea. Inevitably delayed puberty will occur unless adequate caloric intake is provided."

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor.
