    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the relationship between pKb, pOH, and pH. The pKb is the negative logarithm of the dissociation constant of a base, which is related to the pOH of a solution. The pOH is the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydroxide ions in a solution. In a solution of a weak base, the concentration of hydroxide ions is directly related to the concentration of the base. Since pOH is the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydroxide ions, a weak base will have a lower pOH than a strong base. Therefore, the pKb of a weak base will be lower than the pOH. The pH of a solution is related to the pOH by the equation pH + pOH = 14. Since the pKb is lower than the pOH, the pH will be higher than the pKb. However, we are looking for the pKb of a very weak base, which will be close to 7 at 25\u00b0C. This is because very weak bases are almost completely ionized at physiological pH, and the pKb is a measure of the strength of the base. A very weak base will have a pKb close to 7 at 25\u00b0C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Other bases, such as sodium hydroxide, reduce the number of H+ ions indirectly, by making OH\u2013 ions that then combine directly with H+ ions to make H2O. Many bases found in cells are partially associated with H+ ions and are termed weak bases. This is true of compounds that contain an amino group (\u2013NH2), which has a weak tendency to reversibly accept an H+ ion from water, increasing the quantity of free OH\u2013 ions.

A buffer can be created by mixing a weak acid (HA) with its conjugate base (A\u2212). If an acid such as HCl is added to a buffer, A\u2212 can neutralize it, being converted to HA in the process. If a base is added, HA can likewise neutralize it, being converted to A\u2212 in the process. Maximum buffering capacity occurs at a pH equal to the pKa, but a conjugate acid-base pair can still serve as an effective buffer when the pH of a solution is within approximately \u00b11 pH unit of the pKa. If the amounts of HA and A\u2212 are equal, the pH is equal to the pKa. As shown in Figure 1.9, a solution containing acetic acid (HA = CH3 \u2013 COOH) and acetate (A\u2212 = CH3 \u2013 COO\u2212) with a pKa of 4.8 resists a change in pH from pH 3.8 to 5.8, with maximum buffering at pH 4.8.

Ionization of Weak Acids and Weak Bases; the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation The electrostatic charge of an ionized molecule attracts water dipoles and results in a polar, relatively water-soluble and lipid-insoluble complex. Because lipid diffusion depends on relatively high lipid solubility, ionization of drugs may markedly reduce their ability to permeate membranes. A very large percentage of the drugs in use are weak acids or weak bases; Table 1\u20133 lists some examples. For drugs, a weak acid is best defined as a neutral molecule that can reversibly dissociate into an anion (a negatively charged molecule) and a proton (a hydrogen ion). For example, aspirin dissociates as follows: A weak base can be defined as a neutral molecule that can form a cation (a positively charged molecule) by combining with a proton.

Other applications of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used to calculate how the pH of a physiologic solution responds to changes in the concentration of a weak acid and/or its corresponding salt form. For example, in the bicarbonate buffer system, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation predicts how shifts in the bicarbonate ion concentration, [HCO3\u2212], and the carbon dioxide concentration [CO2] influence pH (Fig. 1.12A). The equation is also useful for calculating the abundance of ionic forms of acidic and basic drugs. For example, most drugs are either weak acids or weak bases (Fig. 1.12B). Acidic drugs (HA) release a H+, causing a charged anion (A\u2212) to form. Weak bases (BH+) can also release a H+.

Likewise, for a weak base, such as morphine, the uncharged B form permeates through the cell membrane, but BH+ does not. Therefore, the effective concentration of the permeable form of each drug at its absorption site is determined by the relative concentrations of the charged (impermeant) and uncharged (permeant) forms. The ratio between the two forms is determined by the pH at the site of absorption and by the strength of the weak acid or base, which is represented by the pKa of the ionizable group. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is useful in determining how much drug is found on either side of a membrane that separates two compartments that differ in pH, for example, the stomach (pH 1.0\u20131.5) and blood plasma (pH 7.4).

Because these lipid barriers separate aqueous compartments, the lipid:aqueous partition coefficient of a drug determines how readily the molecule moves between aqueous and lipid media. In the case of weak acids and weak bases (which gain or lose electrical charge-bearing protons, depending on the pH), the ability to move from aqueous to lipid or vice versa varies with the pH of the medium, because charged molecules attract water molecules.

If a drug is in a lipid-soluble form during its passage down the renal tubule, a significant fraction will be reabsorbed by simple passive diffusion. If the goal is to accelerate excretion of the drug (eg, in a case of drug overdose), it is important to prevent its reabsorption from the tubule.

This solution solubilizes, denatures, and dissociates all the polypeptide chains but leaves their intrinsic charge unchanged. The polypeptide chains are then separated in a pH gradient by a procedure called isoelectric focusing, which takes advantage of the variation in the net charge on a protein molecule with the pH of its surrounding solution. Every protein has a characteristic isoelectric point, the pH at which the protein has no net charge and therefore does not migrate in an electric field. In isoelectric focusing, proteins are separated electrophoretically in a narrow tube of polyacrylamide gel in which a gradient of pH is established by a mixture of special buffers. Each protein moves to a position in the gradient that"

            "content": "The specific nature of a particular drug-receptor bond is of less practical importance than the fact that drugs that bind through weak bonds to their receptors are generally more selective than drugs that bind by means of very strong bonds. This is because weak bonds require a very precise fit of the drug to its receptor if an interaction is to occur. Only a few receptor types are likely to provide such a precise fit for a particular drug structure. Thus, if we wished to design a highly selective short-acting drug for a particular receptor, we would avoid highly reactive molecules that form covalent bonds and instead choose a molecule that forms weaker bonds. A few substances that are almost completely inert in the chemical sense nevertheless have significant pharmacologic effects. For example, xenon, an \u201cinert\u201d gas, has anesthetic effects at elevated pressures."

            "content": "The most common strategy for solving this problem is to use ordinary differential equations. The equations that describe biochemical reactions have a simple premise: the rate of change in the concentration of any molecular species X (that is, d[X]/dt) is given by the balance of the rate of its appearance with that of its disappearance. For our example, the rate of change in the concentration of the bound promoter complex, [A:pX], is determined by the rates of complex assembly and disassembly. We can incorporate these rates into the differential equation shown in Figure 8\u201373A (Equation 8\u20134). When [A] changes, Equation 8\u20134 can be solved to generate the concentration of [A:pX] as a function of time. Notice that when kon [A][pX] = koff [A:pX], then d[A:pX]/dt = 0 and [A:pX] stops changing. At this point, the system has reached the steady state."
