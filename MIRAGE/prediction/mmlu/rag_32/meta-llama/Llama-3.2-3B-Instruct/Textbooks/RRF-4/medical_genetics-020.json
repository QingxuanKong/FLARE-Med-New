Previously, these clinical features were believed to represent two different disorders: DiGeorge syndrome and velocardiofacial syndrome.

The genetic abnormality underlying this complex developmental disorder is a deletion within one copy of chromosome 22. The deletion varies between 1.5 and 5 megabases in size, with the smallest deletion that causes the syndrome containing approximately 24 genes. The relevant gene within this interval is TBX1, which encodes the transcription factor Tbox 1. DiGeorge syndrome is caused by the deletion of a single copy of this gene, such that patients with this disorder are haploinsufficient for TBX1. Without the proper inductive thymic environment, T cells cannot mature, and both cellmediated immunity and Tcelldependent antibody production are impaired. Patients with this syndrome have normal levels of serum immunoglobulin but an absence of, or incomplete development of, the thymus and parathyroid glands, with varying degrees of Tcell immunodeficiency."

Syndromes caused by chromosomal abnormalitiesinclude trisomy 21 (Down syndrome or DS), trisomy 13, trisomy 18, Turner syndrome (TS), and Klinefelter syndrome (KS), as well as rarer chromosomal duplications, deletions, or inversions."

            "content": "As already discussed in this chapter, various diseases may occur as a result of copy number abnormalities, at the level of the entire chromosome (trisomy 21), chromosomal segments (22q11 deletion syndrome), or submicroscopic intragenic deletions (WAGR syndrome). Karyotype analysis of chromosomes by G banding remains the classic approach for identifying changes at the chromosomal level; however, as might be expected, the resolution with this technique is fairly low. To identify subchromosomal alterations, both focused analysis of chromosomal regions by FISH and global genomic approaches such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) are commonly used."

            "content": "Described first in 1866 by Langdon Down, this is easily the best known of the chromosomal dysgeneses. Its frequency is 1 in 600 to 700 births, and it accounts for approximately 10 percent of all cases in every large series of cases of severe mental retardation. One cannot distinguish the Down syndrome with the common triplication of chromosome 21 from that caused by a translocation, and therefore duplication, of one arm, specifically the distal portion of the long arm that seems to contain the region responsible for the syndrome. Two genes have been of greatest interest in that region: DYRK1A and DSCR1."
