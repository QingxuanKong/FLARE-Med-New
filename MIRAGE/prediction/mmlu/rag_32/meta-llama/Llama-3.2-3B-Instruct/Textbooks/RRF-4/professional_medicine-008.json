He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily and has consumed six 12-oz bottles of beer on weekend nights during the past 30 years. His vital signs are within normal limits.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate lymph node to evaluate first for metastasis in a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, we need to consider the lymphatic drainage of the tongue. The tongue is supplied by the lingual branches of the external and internal carotid arteries, which drain into the internal jugular vein and then to the jugulosubclavian junction. From there, the lymphatic drainage proceeds to the deep cervical lymph nodes. The submental and submandibular lymph nodes are also involved in the lymphatic drainage of the tongue. Given the location of the tumor on the apex of the tongue, the submental and submandibular lymph nodes are the most likely to be involved in the lymphatic drainage of the tumor. Therefore, it is most appropriate to evaluate these lymph nodes first for evidence of metastasis in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The majority of these are related to cell damage caused by smoking and alcohol use. Certain viruses are also related to cancers in the head and neck, including human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). A 50-year-old overweight woman came to the doctor complaining of hoarseness of voice and noisy breathing. She was also concerned at the increase in size of her neck. On examination she had a slow pulse rate (45 beats per minute). She also had an irregular knobby mass in the anterior aspect of the lower neck, which deviated the trachea to the right.

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

A 68-year-old man came to his family physician complaining of discomfort when swallowing (dysphagia). The physician examined the patient and noted since his last visit he had lost approximately 18 lb over 6 months. Routine blood tests revealed the patient was anemic and he was referred to the gastroenterology unit.

Squamous cell carcinoma and premalignant dysplasia should be considered early and a diagnostic biopsy performed. This awareness and this procedure are critically important because early-stage malignancy is vastly more treatable than late-stage disease. High-risk sites include the lower lip, floor of the mouth, ventral and lateral tongue, and soft palate\u2013tonsillar pillar complex. Significant risk factors for oral cancer in Western countries include sun exposure (lower lip), tobacco and alcohol use, and human papillomavirus infection. In India and some other Asian countries, smokeless tobacco mixed with betel nut, slaked lime, and spices is a common cause of oral cancer. Rarer causes of chronic oral ulcer, such as tuberculosis, fungal infection, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and midline granuloma may look identical to carcinoma. Making the"

Tumors of the tongue base or oropharynx can cause decreased tongue mobility and alterations in speech. Cancers of the oropharynx or hypopharynx rarely cause early symptoms, but they may cause sore throat and/or otalgia. HPV-related tumors frequently present with neck lymphadenopathy as the first sign. Hoarseness may be an early symptom of laryngeal cancer, and persistent hoarseness requires referral to a specialist for indirect laryngoscopy and/or radiographic studies. If a head and neck lesion treated initially with antibiotics does not resolve in a short period, further workup is indicated; to simply continue the antibiotic treatment may be to lose the chance of early diagnosis of a malignancy."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

In examining such patients, a detailed history and physical examination of these organ systems must be performed.Other causes of lung cancer include exposure to a num-ber of industrial compounds, including asbestos, arsenic, and chromium compounds. In fact, the combination of asbestos and cigarette smoke exposure has a multiplicative effect on risk. Pre-existing lung disease confers an increased risk of lung cancer\u2014up to 13%\u2014for individuals who have never smoked. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are at higher risk for lung cancer than would be predicted based on smoking risk alone. Patients with secondary scar formation related to a his-tory of tuberculosis or other lung infections also have a higher risk of primary lung carcinoma. This increase is thought to be related to poor clearance of inhaled"
