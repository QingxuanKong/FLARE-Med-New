Homeotic cluster genes, also known as Hox genes, are a group of genes that play a crucial role in the development of body segments in Drosophila. They are responsible for specifying the identity of each segment along the anterior-posterior axis. Mutations in homeotic cluster genes can result in defects in segment formation and patterning. The correct answer can be deduced by analyzing the effects of homeotic mutations on Drosophila development. Homeotic mutations can cause the transformation of one segment into another, resulting in abnormal body shape and structure. This is a well-documented phenomenon in Drosophila development. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Transformation of one segment into another.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

In the Antennapedia mutant, for example, legs sprout from the head in place of antennae, whereas in the Bithorax mutant, portions of an extra pair of wings appear where normally there should be the much smaller appendages called halteres (Figure 21\u201323). These mutations transform parts of the body into structures appropriate to other positions, and they are called homeotic mutations (from the Greek \u201chomoios,\u201d meaning similar) because the transformation is between structures of a recognizably similar general type, changing one kind of limb, or one kind of segment, into another.

The discovery of these genes and the subsequent analysis of their functions was a famous tour de force and had a revolutionary impact on all of developmental biology, earning its discoverers a Nobel Prize.

Drosophila mutants with body parts strangely misplaced or mispatterned provided the key to the identification and characterization of the genes required to make a properly structured body, with gut, limbs, eyes, and all the other parts in their correct places. Once these Drosophila genes were sequenced, the genomes of vertebrates could be scanned for homologs. These were found, and their functions in vertebrates were then tested by analyzing mice in which the genes had been mutated. The results, as we see later in the book, reveal an astonishing degree of similarity in the molecular mechanisms that govern insect and vertebrate development (discussed in Chapter 21)."

In mice and humans, for example, there are four such complexes\u2014called the HoxA, HoxB, HoxC, and HoxD complexes\u2014each on a different chromosome. Individual genes in each complex can be recognized by their sequences as counterparts of specific members of the Drosophila set. Indeed, mammalian Hox genes can function in Drosophila as partial replacements for the corresponding Drosophila Hox genes.

This cytoplasm contains a mixture of transcription regulators that are distributed unevenly along the length of the embryo, thus providing positional information that distinguishes one part of the embryo from another (Figure 7\u201326).

Mutations in a gap gene eliminate one or more groups of adjacent segments: in the mutant Kr\u00fcppel, for example, the larva lacks eight segments. Next comes a set of eight pair-rule genes. Mutations in these genes cause a series of deletions affecting alternate segments, leaving the embryo with only half as many segments as usual; although all the mutants display this two-segment periodicity, they differ in the precise pattern.

However, if that offspring is a female, she cannot deposit any functional Bicoid mRNA into her own eggs, which will therefore develop into headless embryos, regardless of the father\u2019s genotype. The egg-polarity genes act first in a hierarchy of gene systems that define a progressively more detailed pattern of body parts.

Does Dpp stimulate cell division, cell growth, or both? How can you tell? 21\u201317 The highly branched structures of neurons would seem to make it almost inevitable that they should make unproductive synapses with themselves, yet they manage to avoid this outcome very effectively. How is this accomplished in vertebrates?"

Their control by the egg-polarity genes and their actions on one another and on still other genes can be deciphered by comparing gene expression in normal and mutant embryos. By using appropriate probes to detect RNA transcripts or their protein products, one can observe genes switch on and off in changing patterns. By comparing these patterns in different mutants, one can begin to discern the logic of the entire gene control system. The products of the egg-polarity genes provide the global positional signals in the early embryo (see Figure 21\u201317). The Bicoid protein, as we have seen, acts as 0.2 mm"

These are epithelial pouches that grow by cell proliferation during the larval period and, during the pupal stage, form the organs and extremities of the adult fly (Figure 21\u201360). Experiments have been chiefly done on the wing imaginal disc. Mutations in components of the cell-cycle control machinery can be used to speed up or slow down the rate of cell division in the disc. Remarkably, such mutations can result in an excessive number of abnormally small cells Figure 21\u201360 The imaginal discs in the Drosophila larva (below) and the structures in the adult (above) that they give rise to.

After the gap gene products refine their positions by mutual repression, they provide a second tier of positional signals that act more locally to regulate finer details of patterning. Gap genes act by controlling the expression of yet other genes, including the pair-rule genes. The pair-rule genes, in turn, collaborate with one another and with the gap genes to set up"
