    "question": "A 34-year-old white woman comes to the emergency department because of a persistent dull headache for the past 3 days. She has been taking acetaminophen without relief. She says, \"I haven't slept in 3 days and I am having trouble focusing at work.\" There is no history of trauma and she takes no medications. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 14 years but does not drink alcoholic beverages. Vital signs are temperature 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse 86/min, respirations 19/min, and blood pressure 182/100 mm Hg. Examination of the head shows no abnormalities. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light; there is mild photophobia. Funduscopic examination is normal. A serous effusion is noted on examination of the left tympanic membrane. Neck is stiff with painful flexion; when the patient's neck is flexed forward, she reports and electric shock sensation. Mild expiratory wheezes are heard on auscultation of the chest. A midsystolic click is heard best at the left sternal border; there are no murmurs or gallops. Abdominal examination shows striae, but is otherwise noncontributory. Examination of the lower extremities shows varicosities bilaterally and 1+ edema; muscle strength is 4/5. Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following physical findings is most indicative of the need for immediate further evaluation?",

The presence of a midsystolic click is a red flag sign that requires further evaluation. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as neck stiffness and expiratory wheezes, may be indicative of aortic dissection, especially in the context of hypertension. The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 182/100 mmHg, which is consistent with hypertension. The midsystolic click is a key finding that warrants further evaluation for aortic dissection. The other options, abdominal striae, expiratory wheezes, and mild neck stiffness, may be present in various conditions, but they are not as specific or concerning for aortic dissection as the midsystolic click.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"} Note: The midsystolic click is a key physical finding that is highly suggestive of aortic dissection, which is a medical emergency.

Pulmonary abnormalities raise concern for aspiration of vomitus. Abdominal auscultation may reveal absent bowel sounds with ileus. High-pitched rushes suggest bowel obstruction, whereas a succussion splash upon abrupt lateral movement of the patient is found with gastroparesis or pyloric obstruction. Tenderness or involuntary guarding raises suspicion of inflammation, whereas fecal blood suggests mucosal injury from ulcer, ischemia, or tumor.

The physical examination in cardiogenic pulmonary edema is notable for evidence of increased intracardiac pressures (S3 gallop, elevated jugular venous pulse, peripheral edema) and rales and/or wheezes on auscultation of the chest. In contrast, the physical examination in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is dominated by the findings of the precipitating condition; pulmonary findings may be relatively normal in the early stages. The chest radiograph in cardiogenic pulmonary edema typically shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette, vascular redistribution, interstitial thickening, and perihilar alveolar infiltrates; pleural effusions are common. In noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, heart size is normal, alveolar infiltrates are distributed more uniformly throughout the lungs, and pleural effusions are uncommon."

Flushing over the face, the V area of the neck, and the back is characteristic, as are pharyngeal injection, periorbital edema, and conjunctival suffusion. Petechiae often develop in areas of pressure, the conjunctivae, and the axillae. Back pain and tenderness to percussion at the costovertebral angle reflect massive retroperitoneal edema. Laboratory evidence of mild to moderate DIC is present. Other laboratory findings of HFRS include proteinuria and active urinary sediment.

Which of the eicosanoid agonists have been demonstrated to reduce both morbidity and mortality in patients with such a diagnosis? What are the modes of action? A 40-year-old woman presented to her doctor with a 6-month history of increasing shortness of breath. This was associated with poor appetite and ankle swell-ing. On physical examination, she had elevated jugular venous distention, a soft tricuspid regurgitation murmur, clear lungs, and mild peripheral edema. An echocardio-gram revealed tricuspid regurgitation, severely elevated"

            "content": "Additional clues to the etiology and importance of a heart murmur can be gleaned from the history and other physical examination findings. Symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, neurologic, or pulmonary disease help focus the differential diagnosis, as do findings relevant to the jugular venous pressure and waveforms, the arterial pulses, other heart sounds, the lungs, the abdomen, the skin, and the extremities. In many instances, laboratory studies, an ECG, and/or a chest x-ray may have been obtained earlier and may contain valuable information. A patient with suspected infective endocarditis, for example, may have a murmur in the setting of fever, chills, anorexia, fatigue, dyspnea, splenomegaly, petechiae, and positive blood cultures. A new systolic murmur in a patient with a marked fall in blood pressure after a recent MI suggests myocardial rupture. By contrast, an isolated grade 1 or 2 mid-systolic murmur at the left sternal border in a healthy, active, and asymptomatic young"

            "content": "History and Physical Examination The chest discomfort, often severe enough to be described as frank pain, is typically located in the sub-sternal region or sometimes in the epigastrium, and radiates to the left arm, left shoulder, and/or neck. Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

Sinus tachycardia is present in ~40% of hyperthyroid patients, and atrial fibrillation is present in ~15%. Physical examination may reveal a hyperdynamic precordium, a widened pulse pressure, increases in the intensity of the first heart sound and the pulmonic component of the second heart sound, and a third heart sound. An increased incidence of mitral valve prolapse has been described in hyperthyroid patients, in which case a midsystolic murmur may be heard at the left sternal border with or without a midsystolic click. A systolic pleuropericardial friction rub (Means-Lerman scratch) may be heard at the left second intercostal space during expiration and is thought to result from the hyperdynamic cardiac motion."

Usually the onset is acute and the temperature is elevated, from 38 to 40\u00b0C (100.4 to 104\u00b0F). Headache that is more severe than that associated with other febrile states is the most frequent symptom. A variable but usually mild degree of lethargy, irritability, and drowsiness may occur. Photophobia and pain on movement of the eyes are common additional complaints. Stiffness of the neck and spine on forward bending attests to the presence of meningeal irritation (meningismus), but at first it may be so slight as to pass unnoticed. When there are accompanying neurologic signs, they too tend to be mild or fleeting: paresthesia in an extremity, or wavering Babinski signs."
