Two weeks ago, she had streptococcal pharyngitis treated with amoxicillin. She has been sexually active with two partners over the past year; she uses condoms for contraception. Her last menstrual period was 1 week ago. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg.

When the cause is related to poor perineal hygiene, cultures often reveal a mixture of bacterial organisms. In this situation, the typical history is intermittent symptoms of irritation, itching, discharge, and odor over many months to years. Treatment should be initiated with a focus on hygiene and cleansing measures (40). A short-term (less than 4 weeks) course of treatment with topical estrogens and broad-spectrum antibiotics may be necessary. The problem is frequently recurrent. In girls who have a relatively acute onset of vaginal discharge and vulvovaginal symptoms, a single bacterial organism is more likely to be the cause of their symptoms."

Call the physician if excessive vaginal bleeding or fever occurs. 7. Schedule a return appointment at the time specified by the physician. The physician should provide telephone numbers for emergencies both during and after office hours. Typically, the first postoperative visit is scheduled about 4 weeks after discharge from the hospital. At the time of that visit, the patient should be ambulating well, and vaginal discharge or bleeding should be minimal. Speculum examination of the cuff should be gentle and cursory, but the patient should be assured that the healing process is proceeding normally. Finally, the patient\u2019s questions should be answered and advice given on increasing her activity level, including sexual activity, work, and normal household activity.

The most common initiating event is coitus. Immediate examination for cuff integrity is necessary. Treatment typically requires surgical repair in the operating room. Before discharging the patient, instructions should be reviewed. Printed postoperative instructions are helpful to the patient and a suggested set of instructions are as follows: 1. Avoid strenuous activity for the first 2 weeks, and increase activity level gradually. 2. Avoid heavy lifting, douching, or sexual intercourse until instructed by the physician. 3. Bathe as needed using shower or tub baths. 4. Follow a regular diet. 5. Avoid straining for a bowel movement or urination. For constipation, use Milk of Magnesia or Metamucil (1 tsp in juice). 6.

A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home.

The cause of in\ufb02ammatory vaginitis is unknown, but Gram stain findings reveal a relative absence of normal long gram-positive bacilli (lactobacilli) and their replacement with gram-positive cocci, usually streptococci. Women with this disorder have a purulent vaginal discharge, vulvovaginal burning or irritation, and dyspareunia. A less frequent symptom is vulvar pruritus. Vaginal erythema is present, and there may be an associated vulvar erythema, vulvovaginal ecchymotic spots, and colpitis macularis. The pH of the vaginal secretions is uniformly higher than 4.5 in these patients."

G. vaginalis is often present as part of the normal vaginal flora in preadolescent girls but is more common in girls who are sexually active. Candida is much less common in preadolescent girls than in women. Available @ StudentConsult.com The primary symptoms of vulvovaginitis are vaginal discharge, erythema, and pruritus. Characteristics of specific etiologies are outlined in Table 115-1. Wet mount microscopic examination, prepared by mixing vaginal secretions with normal saline solution, and culture may be used to confirm a specific diagnosis (see Table 115-1).Clue cells are vaginal epithelial cells that are covered with G. vaginalis and have a granular appearance. Vaginal cultures for G. vaginalis are not useful. Candida may be identified by saline wet mount or by culture."

            "content": "Vulvovaginitis, which is inflammation of the vulva or the vagina or both, is the most common gynecologic problem inchildren. Low prepubertal levels of estrogen result in thin, atrophic vaginal epithelium that is susceptible to bacterialinvasion. At puberty estrogen increases, and the pH of the vagina becomes more acidic. There are several specific causesof vulvovaginitis (Table 115-1), including sexually transmitted infections such as Trichomonas vaginalis and herpes simplex virus (see Chapter 116). Nonspecific vaginitis results from overgrowth of normal aerobic vaginal flora that is associated with poor hygiene. Bacterial vaginosis is caused by Gardnerella vaginalis, which interacts synergistically with vaginal anaerobes, including Bacteroides, Mobiluncus, and Peptostreptococcus."

She became convinced that her roommate was listening in on her phone conversations and planning to alter her essays. She became reclusive and spent most of her time locked in her room. After much difficulty, her teachers convinced her to be seen by the student health service. It was believed she was beginning to show signs of schizophrenia and she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where she was started on antipsychotic medications. While in the hospital, she had a generalized seizure which prompted her transfer to our service. Her spinal fluid analysis showed 10 lymphocytes per mL3. She was found to have an anti-NMDA receptor antibody, which prompted an ultrasound examination of the pelvis. The left ovary was thought to show a benign cyst. Because of the neurological syndrome, the ovarian cyst was resected and revealed a microscopic ovarian teratoma. The neuropsychiatric syndrome resolved. She has since graduated and"
