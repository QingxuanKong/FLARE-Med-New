This is formally defined as a deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for alleles at linked loci. This is reflected in the very low recombination rates between certain loci within the HLA complex. For example, recombination between DR and DQ loci is almost never observed in family studies, and characteristic haplotypes with particular arrays of DR and DQ alleles are found in every population. Similarly, the complement components C2, C4, and Bf are almost invariably inherited together, and the alleles at these loci are found in characteristic haplotypes. In contrast, there is a recombinational hotspot between DQ and DP, which are separated by 1\u20132 cM of genetic distance, despite their close physical proximity.

Thus, this system can be switched from one stable steady state to the other by subjecting it to an input (or a perturbation) that is large enough to make the other steady state more attractive. More generally, every stable steady state has a corresponding region of attraction, which can be intuitively thought of as the range of perturbations (of [X] or [Y] in this example) for which the dynamic trajectories converge back to that particular steady state, rather than switch to the other one."

The kinetic rate constant koff is a particularly useful number because it provides valuable information about how long two proteins remain bound to one another.

Inspection confirms that the lower the pH relative to the pKa, the greater will be the fraction of drug in the protonated form.

As a result, we can assume that the binding reaction is at equilibrium on the time scale of transcription, and we can calculate promoter occupancy by protein A using the equilibrium equation discussed earlier (Equation 8\u20133, Figure 8\u201372E). To determine transcription rate, we simply multiply the occupied promoter fraction by a transcription rate constant, \u03b2, that represents the binding of RNA polymerase and the subsequent steps that lead to production of mRNA and protein (Figure 8\u201374A).

Forster and S. matsumura, Science 308:965\u2013966, 2005.) density of known genes a polymorphism, the variants must be common enough to give a reasonably high probability that the genomes of two randomly chosen individuals will differ at the given site; a probability of 1% is commonly chosen as the cutoff. Two human genomes sampled from the modern world population at random will differ at approximately 2.5 \u00d7 106 such sites (1 per 1300 nucleotide pairs). As will be described in the overview of genetics in Chapter 8, SNPs in the human genome can be extremely useful for genetic mapping analyses, in which one attempts to associate specific traits (phenotypes) with specific DNA sequences for medical or scientific purposes (see p. 493). But while useful as genetic markers, there is good evidence that most of these SNPs have little or no effect on human fitness. This is as expected, since deleterious variants will have been selected against during human evolution and, unlike SNPs, should"

            "content": "B. Characteristics Usage of the genetic code is remarkably consistent throughout all living organisms. It is assumed that once the standard genetic code evolved in primitive organisms, any mutation (a permanent change in DNA sequence) that altered its meaning would have caused the alteration of most, if not all, protein sequences, resulting in lethality. Characteristics of the genetic code include the following. 1. Specificity: The genetic code is specific (unambiguous), because a particular codon always codes for the same amino acid. 2. Universality: The genetic code is virtually universal insofar as its specificity has been conserved from very early stages of evolution, with only slight differences in the manner in which the code is translated. [Note: An exception occurs in mitochondria, in which a few codons have meanings different than those shown in Figure 32.2. For example, UGA codes for tryptophan (Trp).] 3."
