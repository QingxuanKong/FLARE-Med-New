Let's examine each option: A. A high energy diet and large appetite (Document [27] (Title: Gynecology_Novak)): While a good diet is essential for athletes, it is not the primary factor determining success in sports. The document mentions that higher-intensity training, poor nutrition, stress of competition, and associated eating disorders increase an athlete's risk for menstrual dysfunction and osteoporosis, but it does not suggest that a high energy diet and large appetite are the main factors determining success. B. High intelligence and motivation to succeed (Document [29] (Title: Neurology_Adams)): Intelligence and motivation are important for academic and professional success, but they are not the primary factors determining success in sports. The document discusses the role of early learning in modifying the level of ability attained, but it does not suggest that intelligence and motivation are the main factors determining success in sports. C. A good coach and the motivation to succeed (Document [31] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison)): A good coach and motivation are important for athlete development, but they are not the primary factors determining success in sports. The document emphasizes the importance of education and self-care in treatment, but it does not suggest that a good coach and motivation are the main factors determining success. D. Innate ability and the capacity to respond to the training stimulus (Document [12] (Title: Neurology_Adams) and Document [24] (Title: Physiology_Levy)): These documents suggest that innate ability and the capacity to respond to the training stimulus are crucial factors determining success in sports. The document [12] states that athletes who have had concussion are more likely to have another concussion in the same playing season, and that most prospective studies show a decline in reaction time and in other neuropsychologic tests after concussion, which returns to baseline over several days or weeks. The document [24] also discusses the importance of fast-twitch, fatigue-resistant motor units, which are characteristic of athletes who have a high percentage of fast oxidative glycolytic fibers. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is D. innate ability and the capacity to respond to the training stimulus.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",

All adolescents should be assessed to monitor progression through sexual maturity rating stages (see Chapter 67). Other issues in physical development include scoliosis, obesity, and trauma (see Chapters 29 and 203). Most scoliosis is mild and requires only observation for progression. Obesity may first manifest during childhood and is an issue for many adolescents."

Typically, most athletic endeavors involve elements of all three. The learning aspect of training involves motivational factors, as well as neuromuscular coordination. This aspect of training does not involve adaptive changes in the muscle fibers per se. However, motor skills can persist for years without regular training, unlike the responses of muscle cells to exercise."

Also in later childhood, precocity in learning complex motor skills as well as skill in games and the development of an all-around interest in athletic activity becomes evident.

This beneficial effect wanes if exercise is discontinued. Most of the studies are short term, and a more substantial effect on bone mass is likely if exercise is continued over a long period. Exercise also has beneficial effects on neuromuscular function, and it improves coordination, balance, and strength, thereby reducing the risk of falling.

These changes in skeletal mass are most marked when the stimulus begins during growth and before the age of puberty. Adults are less capable than children of increasing bone mass after restoration of physical activity. Epidemiologic data support the beneficial effects on the skeleton of chronic high levels of physical activity. Fracture risk is lower in rural communities and in countries where physical activity is maintained into old age. However, when exercise is initiated during adult life, the effects of moderate exercise on the skeleton are modest, with a bone mass increase of 1\u20132% in short-term studies of <2 years in duration. It is argued that more active individuals are less likely to fall and are more capable of protecting themselves upon falling, thereby reducing fracture risk."

Failure by the lungs to oxygenate blood fully can be ruled out because even with the most strenuous exercise at sea level, arterial blood is fully saturated with O2. Therefore, O2 delivery to the active muscles (or blood flow because the arterial blood O2 content is normal) appears to be the limiting factor in muscle performance. This limitation could be caused by the inability to increase cardiac output beyond a critical level. In turn, this inability is caused by a limitation in stroke volume because the heart rate reaches maximal levels before maximal V\u02dcO2 is reached. Hence, the major factor that limits muscle performance is the pumping capacity of the heart."

However, O2 use by muscle is probably not a critical factor. During exercise, maximal O2 consumption (maximal V\u02dcO2) by a large percentage of the body\u2019s muscle mass is unchanged or increases only slightly when additional muscles are activated. In fact, during exercise of a large muscle mass, as in vigorous bicycling, the addition of bilateral arm exercise without change in the cycling effort produces only a small increase in cardiac output and maximal VO2. However, the additional arm exercise decreases blood flow to the legs. This centrally mediated (baroreceptor reflex) vasoconstriction during maximal cardiac output prevents the fall in blood pressure that would otherwise be caused by metabolically induced vasodilation in the active muscle.

The principal increase in cardiac output during exercise must therefore be attributed to other factors. Such ancillary factors include the pronounced reduction in peripheral vascular resistance because of the vasodilation in the active skeletal muscles and the increased contractility of cardiac muscle associated with the generalized increase in sympathetic neural activity. Nevertheless, the increase in heart rate is still an important factor. Abundant data show that if the heart rate cannot increase normally during exercise, the augmentation in cardiac output and the capacity for exercise are severely limited. Because stroke volume changes only slightly during exercise, the increase in heart rate may play an important permissive role in augmenting cardiac output during physical exercise."

Deliberate effortful practice (over an extended period of time, sometimes said to be 10 years or 10,000 practice hours) and personal coaching are two strategies that are often used outside medicine (e.g., music, athletics, chess) to promote expertise. Their use in developing medical expertise and maintaining or enhancing it has not yet been adequately explored."

Satisfaction and the likelihood of follow-up increase when patients are educated about prognosis, treatment methods, 119 activity modifications, and strategies to prevent future exacerbations. Patients who report that they did not receive an adequate explanation for their symptoms are likely to request further diagnostic tests. In general, bed rest should be avoided for relief of severe symptoms or kept to a day or two at most. Several randomized trials suggest that bed rest does not hasten the pace of recovery. In general, the best activity recommendation is for early resumption of normal physical activity, avoiding only strenuous manual labor. Possible advantages of early ambulation for ALBP include maintenance of cardiovascular conditioning, improved disk and cartilage nutrition, improved bone and muscle strength, and increased endorphin"
