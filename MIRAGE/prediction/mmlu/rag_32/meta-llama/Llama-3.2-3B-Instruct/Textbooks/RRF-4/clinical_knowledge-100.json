    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the given documents and identify the characteristics of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, leading to a range of symptoms. The documents provide information on the causes, diagnosis, and management of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is characterized by a low level of thyroid hormones, which can lead to symptoms such as weight gain, fatigue, cold intolerance, and dry skin. A raised TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level is a common indicator of hypothyroidism, as the pituitary gland produces more TSH to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones. The documents also mention that weight loss is not a characteristic of hypothyroidism, but rather weight gain is more common. Pre-tibial myxoedema is a condition associated with Graves' disease, which is a cause of hyperthyroidism, not hypothyroidism. An aversion to warm places is not a characteristic of hypothyroidism, and it is not a recognized symptom of the condition. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that corresponds to a raised TSH level.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Because the autoimmune process gradually reduces thyroid function, there is a phase of compensation when normal thyroid hormone levels are maintained by a rise in TSH. Although some patients may have minor symptoms, this state is called subclinical hypothyroidism. Later, unbound T4 levels fall and TSH levels rise further; symptoms become more readily apparent at this stage (usually TSH >10 mIU/L), which is referred to as clinical hypothyroidism or overt hypothyroidism."

The serum TSH concentration is increased in primary hypothyroidism because of a loss of feedback inhibition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and TSH production by the hypothalamus and pituitary, respectively. The TSH concentration is not increased in individuals with hypothyroidism caused by primary hypothalamic or pituitary disease. Serum T4 is decreased in patients with hypothyroidism of any origin. Autoimmunity is the underlying cause of a variety of thyroid diseases, which are collectively referred to as autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). These disorders include thyroiditis, and antibody-mediated disturbances in thyroid function that are not necessarily associated with inflammation (exemplified by Graves disease).

Primary hypothyroidism can be secondary to congenital, autoimmune, or iatrogenic causes. Genetic defects that perturb thyroid development (thyroid dysgenesis) or the synthesis of thyroid hormone (dyshormonogenetic goiter) are rare overall but the most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism in the U.S. Endemic deficiency of dietary iodine is typically manifested by hyothryoidism early in childhood and has been also called congenital, but is not caused by genetic defects.

The most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States at this time is probably Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, an immunologic disorder in genetically predisposed individuals. In this condition, there is evidence of humoral immunity in the presence of antithyroid antibodies and lymphocyte sensitization to thyroid antigens.

Thyroid scans with 99m-pertechnetate or 123-I-iodine are occasionally indicated in the evaluation of pediatric thyroid disease. They can be useful in identifying thyroid agenesis or ectopic thyroid tissue. Available @ StudentConsult.com Short Stature Pubertal Delay Precocious Puberty in the Male Precocious Puberty in the Female Hypothyroidism is diagnosed by a decreased serum free T4 and may be the result of diseases of the thyroid gland (primary hypothyroidism), abnormalities of the pituitary gland (secondary), or abnormalities of the hypothalamus (tertiary). Hypothyroidism is congenital or acquired and may be associated with a goiter (Table 175-2)."

            "content": "Women with a history or high risk of hypothyroidism should ensure that they are euthyroid prior to conception and during early pregnancy because maternal hypothyroidism may adversely affect fetal neural development and cause preterm delivery. The presence of thyroid autoantibodies alone, in a euthyroid patient, is also associated with miscarriage and preterm delivery; it is unclear if levothyroxine therapy improves outcomes. Thyroid function should be evaluated immediately after pregnancy is confirmed and every 4 weeks during the first half of the pregnancy, with less frequent testing after 20 weeks\u2019 gestation (every 6\u20138 weeks depending on whether levothyroxine dose adjustment is ongoing). The levothyroxine dose may need to be increased by up to 50% during pregnancy, with a goal TSH of less than 2.5 mIU/L during the first trimester and less than 3.0 mIU/L during the second and third trimesters. After delivery, thyroxine doses typically return to prepregnancy levels. Pregnant women"

            "content": "Although common in women, the incidence of subclinical hypothyroidism varies depending on age, race, dietary iodine intake, and serum TSH thresholds used to establish the diagnosis Qameson, 2015). In two large studies totaling more than 25,000 pregnant women screened in the first half of pregnancy, subclinical hypothyroidism was identified in 2.3 percent (Casey, 2005; Cleary-Goldman, 2008). he rate of progression to overt thyroid failure is afected by TSH level, age, other disorders such as diabetes, and presence and concentration of antithyroid antibodies. nant women with subclinical hypothyroidism for 5 years and reported that in a third, TSH values became normal. In the other two thirds, those women whose TSH levels were 10 to 15 mUlL developed overt disease at a rate of 19 per 100 patient years. Those women whose TSH levels were < 10rm U IL devel oped overt hypothyroidism at a rate of 2 per 100 patient years."
