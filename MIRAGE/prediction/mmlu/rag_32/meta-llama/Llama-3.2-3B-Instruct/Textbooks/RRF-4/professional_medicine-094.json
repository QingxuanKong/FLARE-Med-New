    "question": "A 6-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department 2 hours after injuring his arm when he fell out of a tree. His mother says that he is extremely active and likes to climb. During the past year, he fractured his right tibia after falling off a trampoline and sustained a concussion after falling off his bicycle. She says that his teachers reprimand him frequently for running wildly in the classroom, talking excessively, and getting out of his seat; he often forgets to turn in his homework. His parents are currently divorcing. His father has a history of illicit drug use. The patient is at the 50th percentile for height and weight. His pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a dislocated left shoulder, healing abrasions over the elbows, and ecchymoses in various stages of healing over the knees. Mental status examination shows a neutral affect. He says that he likes to run and climb trees. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely explanation for the findings in this 6-year-old boy, let's analyze the symptoms and history provided:\\n\\nThe boy is extremely active, likes to climb, and has a history of frequent injuries, including fractures and concussions. He also exhibits behavioral issues, such as talking excessively, running wildly in the classroom, and forgetfulness. Additionally, his parents are divorcing, and his father has a history of illicit drug use.\\n\\nThese symptoms suggest that the boy may be experiencing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The boy's behavior, such as talking excessively, running wildly, and forgetfulness, are common symptoms of ADHD. The history of frequent injuries and the boy's love for climbing and running also support this diagnosis.\\n\\nThe other options, conduct disorder, learning disorder, and seizure disorder, do not fully explain the boy's symptoms and behavior.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely explanation for the findings is attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\\n\\nAnswer: A\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

            "content": "A 45-year-old man with diabetes mellitus visited his nurse because he had an ulcer on his foot that was not healing despite daily dressings. Diabetes can lead to vascular disease of large and medium arteries, narrowing the lumen and reducing blood supply to the extremities, thereby impairing healing. In addition, diabetes can also affect blood supply to nerves, which leads to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy results in reduced sensation, and therefore minor injuries can often go unnoticed. This patient has developed an ulcer on his heel, which is a pressure point and likely to be under repeated strain. The nurse examined the ulcer and found that the ulcer was looking infected with pus at the base of the ulcer and asked for a specialist orthopedic opinion, who requested an x-ray and an MRI. The MRI and x-ray both demonstrated infection invading into the calcaneus with destruction of the bone (Fig. 6.141A,B)."

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

In getting up from a recumbent position, the patient turns his head and trunk and pushes himself sideways to a sitting position. S.A.K. Wilson used an alliterative phrase to describe the characteristic abnormalities of stance and gait: The patient \u201cstraddles as he stands and waddles as he walks.\u201d The waddle is the result of bilateral weakness of the gluteus medius. Many affected boys have a tendency to walk on their toes as a consequence of contractures in the gastrocnemii muscles. Calf pain is frequent. Weakening of the muscles that fix the scapulae to the thorax (serratus anterior, lower trapezius, rhomboids) causes winging of the scapulae, and the scapular angles can sometimes be seen above the shoulders when one is facing the patient."
