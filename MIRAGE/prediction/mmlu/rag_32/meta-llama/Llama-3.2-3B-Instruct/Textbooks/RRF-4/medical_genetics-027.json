As in Hurler syndrome, the accumulated mucopolysaccharides in Hunter syndrome are heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate, but this results from a deficiency of L-iduronate sulfatase. Despite the difference in enzyme deficiency, an accumulation of identical substrates occurs because breakdown of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate requires both \u03b1-L-iduronidase and the sulfatase; if either one is missing, further degradation is blocked.

MPS I H/S is characterized by severe somatic disease, usually without overt neurologic deterioration. MPS I often presents in infancy or early childhood as chronic rhinitis, clouding of the corneas, and hepatosplenomegaly. As the disease progresses, nearly every organ system can be affected.

If any one degradative enzyme is missing, degradation by the other exoenzymes cannot continue. A group of very rare autosomal-recessive diseases called the glycoprotein storage diseases (oligosaccharidoses), caused by a deficiency of any one of the degradative enzymes, results in accumulation of partially degraded structures in the lysosomes. For example, \u03b1-mannosidosis type 3 is a severe, progressive, fatal deficiency of the enzyme \u03b1-mannosidase. Presentation is similar to Hurler syndrome, but immune deficiency is also seen.

This very rare autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, bone disease, heart disease, and respiratory compromise similar to those seen in MPS I; however, MPS VI is due to deficiency of arylsulfatase B and is not associated with neurologic degeneration. Hunter disease (MPS II) is an X-linked disorder due to deficiency in iduronate sulfate sulfatase and has manifestations similar to those of MPS I, including neurologic degeneration. There is no corneal clouding or other eye disease. Like MPS I, MPS II is clinically variable, with CNS and non-CNS variants. HSCT has not been successful in treating CNS disease associated with MPS II. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have approved enzyme therapy for the visceral manifestations of MPS II."

            "content": "Currently, there are two approved therapies for type I Gaucher disease. The first is lifelong enzyme replacement therapy via infusion of recombinant glucocerebrosidase. The second, known as substrate reduction therapy, involves oral intake of an inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase. This leads to reduced systemic levels of glucocerebroside, the substrate for the defective enzyme in Gaucher disease. Clinical trials have confirmed that substrate reduction therapy leads to reduced spleen and liver sizes, improved blood counts, and enhanced skeletal function. Other emerging treatments include gene therapy through transplant of hematopoietic stem cells containing the corrected enzyme."
