    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely cause of the patient's condition, let's analyze the symptoms and examination findings. The patient is a 32-year-old male presenting with shoulder pain for the past two weeks, tenderness at the greater tubercle of the humerus, and painful abduction of the right upper extremity. The key findings are the location of the tenderness (greater tubercle of the humerus) and the specific symptom of painful abduction. The supraspinatus muscle is one of the rotator cuff muscles that surround the shoulder joint. It is responsible for stabilizing the shoulder joint and assisting in abduction of the arm. The supraspinatus tendon inserts into the greater tubercle of the humerus, which is the location of the patient's tenderness. The supraspinatus muscle is also responsible for initiating abduction of the arm, and its dysfunction can lead to pain and weakness during this movement. The patient's painful abduction of the right upper extremity is consistent with supraspinatus tendon pathology. Furthermore, the supraspinatus muscle is commonly affected in cases of rotator cuff injuries, which can be caused by repetitive motion, overuse, or trauma. The patient's history of no significant trauma or previous shoulder problems makes this a likely cause of his condition. The other options are less likely causes of the patient's condition: * Anterior scalene (A) is a muscle in the neck that helps with breathing and is not directly related to shoulder abduction. * Latissimus dorsi (B) is a muscle in the back that helps with adduction and extension of the shoulder joint, but its dysfunction would not cause painful abduction. * Pectoralis minor (C) is a muscle in the chest that helps with movements of the shoulder joint, but its dysfunction would not cause painful abduction. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is a somatic dysfunction of the supraspinatus muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The pain began after a fall on his outstretched hand approximately 6 months previously. The patient recalled having some minor shoulder tenderness but no other specific symptoms. He was otherwise fit and well. On examination of the shoulder, there was marked wasting of the muscles in the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae. The patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there was a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus. The wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when muscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy)."

The examiner should apply direct manual pressure over the subacromial bursa that lies lateral to and immediately beneath the acromion (Fig. 393-4). Subacromial bursitis is a frequent cause of shoulder pain. Anterior to the subacromial bursa, the bicipital tendon traverses the bicipital groove. This tendon is best identified by palpating it in its groove as the patient rotates the humerus internally and externally. Direct pressure over the tendon may reveal pain indicative of bicipital tendinitis. Palpation of the acromioclavicular joint may disclose local pain, bony hypertrophy,or,uncommonly,synovialswelling.WhereasOAandRA commonly affect the acromioclavicular joint, OA seldom involves the glenohumeral joint, unless there is a traumatic or occupational cause."

Nearly 30 percent of the elderly will have shoulder pain, with rotator cuff tendinitis or tear as the primary cause. The rotator cuff is formed by four tendons that attach the scapula to the proximal humerus (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis tendons). Of these, the supraspinatus muscle is the most commonly damaged. Rotator cuff tendinitis is suggested by pain on active abduction (but not passive abduction), pain over the lateral deltoid muscle, nightpain,andevidenceoftheimpingementsigns(painwithoverhead arm activities). The Neer test for impingement is performed by the examiner raising the patient\u2019s arm into forced flexion while stabilizing and preventing rotation of the scapula. A positive sign is present if pain develops before 180\u00b0 of forward flexion. Tear of the rotator cuff is common in the elderly and often results from trauma; it may manifest in the same manner as tendinitis."

The onset can be remarkably abrupt and occasionally awakens the patient from sleep. It is made worse by movements that involve the muscles in the region and the patient searches for a comfortable position. Narcotics are usually required to suppress the pain. After a period of several days there is a rapid development of muscular weakness and thereafter, sensory and reflex impairment. With the development of weakness, the pain begins to subside. In a few cases, the neurologic disorder occurs with little or no antecedent pain. Possibly in some there is pain that is not followed by demonstrable weakness.

            "content": "Most of these changes are transient and are usually due to traction injuries during the surgical procedure. A 33-year-old fit and well woman came to the emergency department complaining of double vision and pain behind her right eye. She had no other symptoms. On examination of the right eye the pupil was dilated. There was a mild ptosis. Testing of eye movement revealed that the eye turned down and out and the pupillary reflex was not present. These findings revealed that the patient had an ipsilateral third nerve palsy (palsy of the oculomotor nerve [III]). The oculomotor nerve [III] is the main motor nerve to the ocular and extra-ocular muscles. It arises from the midbrain and pierces the dura mater to run in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. The oculomotor nerve [III] leaves the cranial cavity and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. Within this fissure it divides into its superior and inferior divisions."

            "content": "The diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasound scan. The patient was seated on a stool and her right shoulder was uncovered. The patient\u2019s hand was placed over her right buttock, a position that acts to externally rotate and extend the shoulder, exposing the supraspinatus tendon for ultrasound scan examination. The ultrasound revealed a completely torn tendon with fluid in the subacromial subdeltoid bursa (eFig. 7.128). The patient underwent a surgical repair and made a good recovery. A 35-year-old baseball pitcher came to the clinic with a history of a recurrent dislocation of the shoulder (eFig. 7.129). An MRI scan was performed to assess the shoulder joint prior to any treatment. The MRI demonstrates the anatomical structures in multiple planes, allowing the physician to obtain an overview of the shoulder and to assess any intraarticular or extraarticular structures that may have been damaged and require surgical repair."

            "content": "In some patients, bony tenderness (presumably reflecting enthesitis or osteitis) may accompany back pain or stiffness, whereas in others it may be the predominant complaint. Common sites include the costosternal junctions, spinous processes, iliac crests, greater trochanters, ischial tuberosities, tibial tubercles, and heels. Hip and shoulder (\u201croot\u201d joint) arthritis is considered part of the axial disease. Hip arthritis occurs in 25\u201335% of patients. Shoulder arthritis is much less common. Severe isolated hip arthritis or bony chest pain may be the presenting complaint, and symptomatic hip disease can dominate the clinical picture. Arthritis of peripheral joints other than the hips and shoulders, usually asymmetric, occurs in up to 30% of patients. Neck pain and stiffness from involvement of the cervical spine are usually relatively late manifestations but are occasionally dominant symptoms. Rare patients, particularly in the older age group, present with predominantly constitutional"

It often is associated with nausea and sometimes vomiting. Patients generally suffer discrete, recurrent attacks of pain, between which they feel well. Physical examination may reveal mild right upper quadrant tenderness during an episode of pain. If the patient is pain free, the physical examination is usually unremarkable. Labora-tory values, such as WBC count and liver function tests, are usu-ally normal in patients with uncomplicated gallstones.Atypical presentations of gallstone disease are common and a high index of suspicion for biliary disease must be main-tained when evaluating patients with abdominal complaints. Association with meals is present in only about 50% of patients. Some patients report milder attacks of pain but relate it to meals. The pain may be located primarily in the back or the left upper or right"
