As noted earlier, there is anecdotal evidence that carbamazepine may be effective in the treatment of generalized tonic-clonic seizures in idiopathic generalized epilepsies but must be used with caution as it can exacerbate absence and myoclonic seizures. Carbamazepine is also effective for the treatment of trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and mania in bipolar disorder. Carbamazepine has nearly 100% oral bioavailability, but the rate of absorption varies widely among patients. Peak levels are usually achieved 6\u20138 hours after administration. Slowing absorption by giving the drug after meals causes a reduction in peak levels and helps the patient tolerate larger total daily doses. Extended-release formulations may also decrease the incidence of adverse effects."

It has the advantage of being titrated upward at a more rapid rate than carbamazepine. Dose-related side effects are similar to carbamazepine but it has less hepatic enzyme induction. Some patients report weight gain after continued use. Hyponatremia has been reported in 3 percent of patients taking oxcarbazepine. Should drowsiness or increased seizure frequency occur, this complication should be suspected. Rashes occur at the same or slightly lower rate than with carbamazepine and there is considerable cross-reactivity for this side effect. Elevated cholesterol and osteoporosis are lesser effects, shared also with carbamazepine."

It was initially marketed for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, for which it is highly effective; it is usually the drug of first choice for this condition. In addition, carbamazepine is a mood stabilizer used to treat bipolar disorder. Structurally, carbamazepine is an iminostilbene (dibenzazepine)\u2014 a tricyclic compound consisting of two benzene rings fused to an azepine group. The structure of carbamazepine is similar to that of tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine, but unlike the tricyclic antidepressants, carbamazepine does not inhibit monoamine (serotonin and norepinephrine) transporters with high affinity; therefore, carbamazepine is not used as an antidepressant despite its ability to treat bipolar disorder.

It is likely that incomplete interruption of nerve impulses results in a hyperpathic state in which every stimulus excites pain. In a number of controlled studies, amitriptyline proved to be an effective therapeutic measure. Initially, it is given in doses of approximately 50 mg at bedtime; if needed, the dosage can be increased gradually to 125 mg daily. The addition of carbamazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin, valproate or one of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs may further moderate the pain, particularly if it is of lancinating type."

She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

            "content": "These drugs are useful primarily for patients with neuropathic pain. Phenytoin (Dilantin) and carbamazepine (Tegretol) were first shown to relieve the pain of trigeminal neuralgia. This pain has a characteristic brief, shooting, electric shock\u2013like quality. In fact, anticonvulsants seem to be particularly helpful for pains that have such a lancinating quality. Newer anticonvulsants, gabapentin (Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica), are effective for a broad range of neuropathic pains. Furthermore, because of their favorable side effect profile, these newer anticonvulsants are often used as first-line agents."

She admits to having taken a \u201chandful\u201d of Lorcet (hydrocodone/acetaminophen, an opioid/nonopioid analgesic combination), Soma (carisoprodol, a centrally acting muscle relaxant), and Cymbalta (duloxetine HCl, an antidepressant/ antifibromyalgia agent) 2 days earlier. On physical examina-tion, the sclera of her eyes shows yellow discoloration. Labora-tory analyses of blood drawn within an hour of her admission reveal abnormal liver function as indicated by the increased indices: alkaline phosphatase 302 (41\u2013133),* alanine amino-transferase (ALT) 351 (7\u201356),* aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1045 (0\u201335),* bilirubin 3.33 mg/dL (0.1\u20131.2),* and pro-thrombin time of 19.8 seconds (11\u201315).* In addition, plasma bicarbonate is reduced, and she has ~45% reduced glomerular filtration rate from the normal value"

She is obese (body mass index [BMI] 33), does not exercise, and spends a good portion of her work day in a seated position. She eats a low-sugar diet and regularly eats packaged frozen meals for dinner because she doesn\u2019t have time to cook regularly. Her most recent laboratory values include a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that is above goal at 160 mg/dL (goal < 100 mg/dL) and a hemo-globin A1c that is well controlled at 6%. Her blood pressure is high at 160/100 mm Hg. Her prescription medications include simvastatin, metformin, and benazepril. She also takes over-the-counter ibuprofen for occasional knee pain and a multivitamin supplement once daily. She has heard good things about natural products and asks you if taking a garlic supplement daily could help to bring her blood"

            "content": "Carbamazepine has been considered to be a reasonable alternative to lithium when the latter is less than optimally efficacious. However, the pharmacokinetic interactions of carbamazepine and its tendency to induce the metabolism of CYP3A4 substrates make it a more difficult drug to use with other standard treatments for bipolar disorder. The mode of action of carbamazepine is unclear, and oxcarbazepine is not effective. Carbamazepine may be used to treat acute mania and also for prophylactic therapy. Adverse effects (discussed in Chapter 24) are generally no greater and sometimes less than those associated with lithium. Carbamazepine may be used alone or, in refractory patients, in combination with lithium or, rarely, valproate."
