However, most cells are unable to synthesize cholesterol and therefore must obtain it from the blood. Normally, cholesterol is ingested in the diet, and it is transported through the blood in association with lipoproteins. Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) in the blood carry cholesterol to cells, where they bind to LDL receptors in the plasma membrane. After the receptors bind LDL, they collect into \u201ccoated pits\u201d and undergo endocytosis as clathrin-coated vesicles. Once inside the cell, the endosomes release LDL and then recycle the LDL receptors back to the cell surface. Inside the cell, LDL is then degraded in lysosomes, and the cholesterol is made available to the cell. Defects in the LDL receptor prevent cellular uptake of LDL. Individuals with this defect have elevated levels of blood LDL, often called \u201cbad cholesterol,\u201d because it is associated with the development of cholesterol-containing"

            "content": "Cholesterol, the characteristic steroid alcohol of animal tissues, performs a number of essential functions in the body. For example, cholesterol is a structural component of all cell membranes, modulating their fluidity, and, in specialized tissues, cholesterol is a precursor of bile acids, steroid hormones, and vitamin D. Therefore, it is critically important that the cells of the body be assured an appropriate supply of cholesterol. To meet this need, a complex series of transport, biosynthetic, and regulatory mechanisms has evolved. The liver plays a central role in the regulation of the body\u2019s cholesterol homeostasis. For example, cholesterol enters the hepatic cholesterol pool from a number of sources including dietary cholesterol as well as that synthesized de novo by extrahepatic tissues and by the liver itself. Cholesterol is eliminated from the liver as unmodified cholesterol in the bile, or it can be converted to bile salts that are secreted into the intestinal lumen. It"

Cholesterol is eliminated from the liver as unmodified cholesterol in the bile, or it can be converted to bile salts that are secreted into the intestinal lumen. It can also serve as a component of plasma lipoproteins that carry lipids to the peripheral tissues. In humans, the balance between cholesterol influx and efflux is not precise, resulting in a gradual deposition of cholesterol in the tissues, particularly in the endothelial linings of blood vessels. This is a potentially life-threatening occurrence when the lipid deposition leads to plaque formation, causing the narrowing of blood vessels (atherosclerosis) and increased risk of cardio-, cerebro-, and peripheral vascular disease. Figure 18.1 summarizes the major sources of liver cholesterol and the routes by which cholesterol leaves the liver."

            "content": "This regulated pathway for cholesterol uptake is disrupted in individuals who inherit defective genes encoding LDL receptors. The resulting high levels of blood cholesterol predispose these individuals to develop atherosclerosis prematurely, and many would die at an early age of heart attacks resulting from coronary artery disease if they were not treated with drugs such as statins that lower the level of blood cholesterol. In some cases, the receptor is lacking altogether. In others, the receptors are defective\u2014in either the extracellular binding site for LDL or the Figure 13\u201350 Schematic representation of macropinocytosis. cell signaling events lead to a reprogramming of actin dynamics, which in turn triggers the formation of cell-surface ruffles. as the ruffles collapse back onto the cell surface, they nonspecifically trap extracellular fluid and macromolecules and particles contained in it, forming large vacuoles, or macropinosomes, as shown."
