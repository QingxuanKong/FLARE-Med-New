    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the characteristics of angiosperms and compare them to the options provided. First, let's define what angiosperms are. Angiosperms are flowering plants that produce seeds enclosed in an ovary, and they are the most diverse group of plants on Earth. They have a unique life cycle, which includes a dominant sporophyte generation and a haploid gametophyte generation. Now, let's examine the options given in the question.\\n\\nOption A, wind-borne pollen, is a characteristic of gymnosperms, not angiosperms. Gymnosperms produce pollen that is dispersed by the wind, whereas angiosperms produce pollen that is dispersed by insects and other animals.\\n\\nOption B, a dominant sporophyte life cycle, is indeed a characteristic of angiosperms. In angiosperms, the sporophyte generation is dominant, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by animals or other means.\\n\\nOption C, alteration of generations, is a characteristic of ferns and other cryptogams, not angiosperms. Cryptogams, such as ferns and mosses, have a life cycle that involves the alternation of generations between a diploid sporophyte and a haploid gametophyte.\\n\\nOption D, double fertilization, is a characteristic of angiosperms. In angiosperms, two types of fertilization occur: double fertilization, where the male gamete fuses with the egg cell to form a diploid zygote, and single fertilization, where the male gamete fuses with two polar nuclei to form a diploid endosperm. This process is unique to angiosperms and is not found in other plant groups.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is D. Double fertilization is a characteristic unique to angiosperms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The new cells are usually produced in special regions called meristems, and they are generally small in comparison with their final size. To accommodate subsequent cell growth, the walls of the newborn cells, called primary cell walls, are thin and extensible, although tough. Once cell growth stops, the wall no longer needs to be extensible: sometimes the primary wall is retained without major modification, but, more commonly, a rigid secondary cell wall is produced by depositing new layers of matrix inside the old ones. These new layers generally have a composition that is significantly different from that of the primary wall.

It is on the fourth point that plant development differs radically: plant cells are unable to migrate or move independently through the embryo because each one is contained within a cell wall, through which it is cemented to its neighbors, as discussed in Chapter 19."

We have seen that germ cells must be protected against high rates of mutation to maintain the species. However, the somatic cells of multicellular organisms must also be protected from genetic change to properly maintain the organized structure of the body. Nucleotide changes in somatic cells can give rise to variant cells, some of which, through \u201clocal\u201d natural selection, proliferate rapidly at the expense of the rest of the organism. In an extreme case, the result is the uncontrolled cell proliferation that we know as cancer, a disease that causes (in Europe and North America) more than 20% of human deaths each year.
