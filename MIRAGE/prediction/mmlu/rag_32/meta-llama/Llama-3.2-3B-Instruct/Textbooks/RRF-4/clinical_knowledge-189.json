Bleeding haemorrhoids lead to melaena per rectum (PR) - This option is incorrect because melaena per rectum is typically associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, not hemorrhoids. B. Pregnancy is a predisposing factor in causing haemorrhoids - This option is correct because pregnancy is a known risk factor for hemorrhoids due to increased venous pressure and hormonal changes. C. Bleeding from first degree haemorrhoids is associated with pain - This option is incorrect because first-degree hemorrhoids are typically painless, while bleeding is more common in higher-grade hemorrhoids. D. Second degree haemorrhoids cannot be returned to the anal canal - This option is incorrect because second-degree hemorrhoids can prolapse and be reduced, but they can also be treated with various procedures to prevent recurrence.

Hemorrhoidal bleeding is described as painless bright red blood seen either in the toilet or upon wiping. Occasional patients can present with significant bleeding, which may be a cause of anemia; however, the presence of a colonic neoplasm must be ruled out in anemic patients. Patients who present with a protruding mass complain about inability to maintain perianal hygiene and are often concerned about the presence of a malignancy."

All surgical methods of management are equally effective in the treatment of symptomatic thirdand fourth-degree hemorrhoids. However, because the sutured hemorrhoidectomy involves the removal of redundant tissue down to the anal verge, unpleasant anal skin tags are removed as well. The stapled hemorrhoidectomy is associated with less discomfort; however, this procedure does not remove anal skin tags. THD uses ultrasound guidance to ligate the blood supply to the anal tissue, hence reducing hemorrhoidal engorgement. No procedures on hemorrhoids should be done in patients who are immunocompromised or who have active proctitis.

These bear ____ regions that recognize the antigen and ____ regions that dictate the antibody class and isotype. camelids and cartilaginous fish, however, produce ________________ and _______________, respectively, which are forming the basis for single-chain antibody production for clinical applications. 4.6 Multiple Choice: Which of the following statements is not true? A. T-cell receptor \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains pair together, but the \u03b1 chain can be switched out for a \u03b3 or a \u03b4 chain.

Few complications are associated with sclero-therapy, but infection and fibrosis have been reported.Excision of Thrombosed External Hemorrhoids Acutely thrombosed external hemorrhoids generally cause intense pain and a palpable perianal mass during the first 24 to 72 hours after thrombosis. The thrombosis can be effectively treated with an elliptical excision performed in the office under local anesthe-sia. Because the clot is usually loculated, simple incision and drainage is rarely effective. After 72 hours, the clot begins to resorb, and the pain resolves spontaneously. Excision is unnec-essary, but sitz baths and analgesics are often helpful.Operative Hemorrhoidectomy A number of surgical proce-dures have been described for elective resection of symptomatic hemorrhoids. All are based on decreasing blood flow to the hem-orrhoidal plexuses and excising redundant anoderm and mucosa.9Brunicardi_Ch29_p1259-p1330.indd 131023/02/19 2:29 PM 1311COLON, RECTUM, AND"

Arrows mark an inflamed diverticulum with the diverticular wall made up only of mucosa. acute rebleeding is <25%. Long-term results (40 months) indicate that more than 50% of patients with acute diverticular bleeds treated with highly selective angiography have had definitive treatment. As another alternative, a selective infusion of vasopressin can be given to stop the hemorrhage, although this has been associated with significant complications, including myocardial infarction and intestinal ischemia. Furthermore, bleeding recurs in 50% of patients once the infusion is stopped."

Unexplained iron-deficiency anemia is also an indication for colonoscopy.Hematochezia is commonly caused by hemorrhoids or a fissure. Sharp, knife-like pain and bright red rectal bleeding with bowel movements suggest the diagnosis of fissure. Pain-less, bright red rectal bleeding with bowel movements is often secondary to a friable internal hemorrhoid that is easily detected by anoscopy. In the absence of a painful, obvious fissure, any patient with rectal bleeding should undergo a careful digital rectal examination, anoscopy, and proctosigmoidoscopy. Fail-ure to diagnose a source in the distal anorectum should prompt colonoscopy.Constipation and Obstructed Defecation. Constipation is an extremely common complaint, affecting more than 4 million people in the United States. Despite the prevalence of this prob-lem,"
