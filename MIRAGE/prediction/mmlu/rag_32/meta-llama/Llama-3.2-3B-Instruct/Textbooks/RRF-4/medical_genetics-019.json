Step 2: Review the relevant documents Document [0] to [9] discuss various genes associated with Alzheimer disease, including APP, PS1, PS2, and APOE. However, the question is specifically asking about polygenic Alzheimer disease. Step 3: Identify the key concept of polygenic Alzheimer disease Polygenic Alzheimer disease refers to Alzheimer disease that is caused by multiple genetic variants, rather than a single gene mutation. Step 4: Review the relevant documents again Document [4] (Title: Pathology_Robbins) discusses the concept of polygenic diseases, which are caused by multiple genetic variants contributing small independent effects. Document [6] (Title: Psichiatry_DSM-5) also mentions polygenic diseases, including Alzheimer disease. Step 5: Analyze the options Option A (APP) is associated with familial Alzheimer disease, but not specifically with polygenic Alzheimer disease. Option B (PS1) and Option C (PS2) are associated with familial Alzheimer disease, but not specifically with polygenic Alzheimer disease. Option D (APOE) is mentioned in several documents as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease, including polygenic Alzheimer disease. Step 6: Draw a conclusion Based on the analysis, the correct answer is Option D (APOE), as it is associated with polygenic Alzheimer disease.

For these reasons it has been proposed that Apo E, by interacting with APP or tau protein in some way, modifies the formation of plaques. Indeed, possession of the e4 allele correlates with increased deposition of A\u03b2 in the brain (McNamara). As pointed out by Hardy, Apo E appears to act at a point in the pathogenesis that is after the various genetic mutations have influenced the cellular pathology that ostensibly causes Alzheimer disease. However, these relationships do not invariably connect an allele to the disease in a particular individual. In other words, the e4 allele does not act as a mendelian trait but as a susceptibility (risk) factor.

Of the several isoforms of Apo E, the presence of E4 (and its corresponding allele e4 on chromosome 19) is associated with a tripling of the risk of developing sporadic Alzheimer disease (Roses; Strittmatter et al; Polvikoski et al).

This identifies regions of the genome that contain a variant gene or genes that confer disease susceptibility.

As mentioned, this also provided an explanation for the Alzheimer changes that characterize the brains of practically all patients with the trisomy 21 defect (Down syndrome) who survive beyond their 20th year; they overproduce amyloid as a result of the triplication of the gene. But gene defects on chromosome 21 are responsible for only a small proportion of familial cases and a minuscule percentage of disease overall. Other kindreds with familial Alzheimer disease have been linked to rare dominant mutations of the presenilin genes on chromosome 14 (presenilin 1; Sherrington et al), accounting in some series for up to 50 percent of familial cases, and on chromosome 1 (presenilin 2), which may"

Furthermore, the ratio of A\u03b242 to A\u03b240 is increased in Down syndrome. Another suggestive connection has been the finding that there are genetic defects in the genes encoding APP and in a pair of endosomal proteins termed presenilin 1 and 2 in some familial forms of Alzheimer disease. The presenilins are catalytic components of \u03b3 secretase, the enzyme that produces the A\u03b242 fragment. Mutations of presenilin 1 and 2 also increase the relative levels of A\u03b242.

Adults with trisomy 21 (Down\u2019s syndrome) consistently develop the typical neuropathologic hallmarks of AD if they survive beyond age 40 years, and many develop a progressive dementia superimposed on their baseline mental retardation. The extra dose of the APP gene on chromosome 21 is the initiating cause of AD in adult Down\u2019s syndrome and results in excess cerebral amyloid production. Supporting this hypothesis, some families with early age-of-onset familial AD (FAD) have point mutations in APP. Although very rare, these families were the first examples of single-gene autosomal dominant transmission of AD."

            "content": "The landscape of neurology has been transformed by modern molecular genetics. Several hundred neurologic and psychiatric disorders can now be diagnosed through genetic testing (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih .gov/sites/GeneTests/?db=GeneTests). The vast majority of these represent highly penetrant mutations that cause rare neurologic disorders; alternatively, they represent rare monogenic causes of common phenotypes. Examples of the latter include mutations of the amyloid precursor protein in familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) in frontotemporal dementia, and \u03b1-synuclein in Parkinson\u2019s disease. These discoveries have been profoundly important because the mutated gene in the familial disorder often encodes a protein that is also pathogenetically involved (although not mutated) in the typical, sporadic form. The common mechanism involves disordered processing and, ultimately, aggregation of the protein leading to cell death (see \u201cProtein Aggregation and"

Furthermore, the expression of certain diseases may be modulated by epigenetic alterations in gene expression, which have not been fully explored."

            "content": "Phenocopies refer to circumstances in which nongenetic conditions mimic a genetic disorder. For example, features of toxin-or drug-induced neurologic syndromes can resemble those seen in Huntington\u2019s disease, and vascular causes of dementia share phenotypic features with familial forms of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia (Chap. 448). As in nonallelic heterogeneity, the presence of phenocopies has the potential to confound linkage studies and genetic testing. Patient history and subtle differences in phenotype can often provide clues that distinguish these disorders from related genetic conditions."

            "content": "The now outdated practice of giving Alzheimer disease and senile dementia the status of separate diseases is attributable to the relatively young age (51 years) of the patient originally studied by Alois Alzheimer in 1907. Such a division is no longer tenable as, except for their age of onset, they are clinically and pathologically indistinguishable. It is probably useful to consider as related but separable, the several heredofamilial forms of Alzheimer disease discussed below."
