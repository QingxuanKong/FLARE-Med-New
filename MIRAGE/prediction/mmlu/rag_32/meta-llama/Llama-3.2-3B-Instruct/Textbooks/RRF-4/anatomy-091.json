    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider where dental plaque is most likely to accumulate in the mouth of a patient with poor oral hygiene. Dental plaque is a sticky biofilm composed of bacteria, salivary proteins, and desquamated epithelial cells. It is most commonly found in areas where the teeth and gums are in close contact. The surfaces of the teeth that are most prone to plaque accumulation are those that are hard to clean, such as the lingual surfaces of the lower incisors and the buccal surfaces of the upper molars. However, in a patient with poor oral hygiene, plaque is likely to accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth that are most accessible and in contact with the tongue and cheeks, which are the lingual surfaces of the lower incisors and the labial surfaces of the upper molars. This is because these surfaces are more difficult to clean with a toothbrush and floss, especially for individuals with limited dexterity or poor oral hygiene habits. Therefore, the correct answer is C. The palatal surfaces of the upper molars and labial surfaces of the lower incisors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Poor oral hygiene, which facilitates buildup of dental plaque and calculus between and on the surfaces of teeth, is the most frequent cause of gingivitis. Dental plaque is a sticky biofilm composed of bacteria, salivary proteins, and desquamated epithelial cells. As it accumulates, plaque becomes mineralized to form calculus, or tartar. In chronic gingivitis, this is accompanied by gingival erythema, edema, and bleeding. Gingivitis may occur at any age but is most prevalent and severe in adolescence, where it is present in 40% to 60% of individuals, after which the incidence tapers off. Fortunately, gingivitis can be reversed, primarily by regular brushing and flossing of teeth which reduces accumulation of plaque and calculus."

            "content": "Consisting of multiple species of \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci, the viridans streptococci are a heterogeneous group of organisms that are important agents of bacterial endocarditis (Chap. 155). Several species of viridans streptococci, including Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mutans, are part of the normal flora of the mouth, where they live in close association with the teeth and gingiva. Some species contribute to the development of dental caries. Previously known as Streptococcus morbillorum, Gemella morbillorum has been placed in a separate genus, along with Gemella haemolysans, on the basis of genetic-relatedness studies. These species resemble viridans streptococci with respect to habitat in the human host and associated infections."

            "content": "Saliva performs both protective and digestive functions. The salivary glands produce about 1,200 mL of saliva a day. Saliva has numerous functions relating to metabolic and nonmetabolic activities, including these: \u0081 Moistening the oral mucosa\u0081 Moistening dry foods to aid swallowing\u0081 Providing a medium for dissolved and suspended food ma terials that chemically stimulate taste buds\u0081 Buffering the contents of the oral cavity, because of its high concentration of bicarbonate ions \u0081 Digesting carbohydrates with the digestive enzyme -amylase, which breaks one to four glycosidic bonds and continues to act in the esophagus and stomach \u0081 Controlling the bacterial flora of the oral cavity by use of lysozyme (muramidase), an enzyme that lyses the muramic acid in certain bacteria (e.g., staphylococci) The unique composition of saliva is summarized in Table 16.1. Saliva is a source of calcium and phosphate ions essential for normal tooth development and maintenance."

            "content": "Halitosis typically emanates from the oral cavity or nasal passages. Volatile sulfur compounds resulting from bacterial decay of food and cellular debris account for the malodor. Periodontal disease, caries, acute forms of gingivitis, poorly fitting dentures, oral abscess, and tongue coating are common causes. Treatment includes correcting poor hygiene, treating infection, and tongue brushing. Hyposalivation can produce and exacerbate halitosis. Pockets of decay in the tonsillar crypts, esophageal diverticulum, esophageal stasis (e.g., achalasia, stricture), sinusitis, and lung abscess account for some instances. A few systemic diseases produce distinctive odors: renal failure (ammoniacal), hepatic (fishy), and ketoacidosis (fruity). Helicobacter pylori gastritis can also produce ammoniacal breath. If a patient presents because of concern about halitosis but no odor is detectable, then pseudohalitosis or halitophobia must be considered."
