Tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and isoleucine are both ketogenic and glucogenic. Nonessential amino acids can be synthesized from metabolic intermediates or from the carbon skeletons of essential amino acids. Essential amino acids need to be obtained from the diet. They include histidine, methionine, threonine, valine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, leucine, and lysine. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is"

Aspartate, \u03b1-ketoglutarate C. Glutamate, alanine D. Pyruvate, aspartate Correct answer = B. Transamination reactions always have an amino acid and an \u03b1-keto acid as substrates. The products of the reaction are also an amino acid (corresponding to the \u03b1-keto substrate) and an \u03b1-keto acid (corresponding to the amino acid substrate). Three amino acid \u03b1-keto acid pairs commonly encountered in metabolism are alanine/pyruvate, aspartate/oxaloacetate, and glutamate/\u03b1-ketoglutarate. In this question, glutamate is deaminated to form \u03b1ketoglutarate, and oxaloacetate is aminated to form aspartate. 9.2. Which one of the following statements about amino acids and their metabolism is correct? A. Free amino acids are taken into the enterocytes by a single proton-linked transport system."

            "content": "V. GLYCOLYSIS REACTIONS The conversion of glucose to pyruvate occurs in two stages (Fig. 8.11). The first five reactions of glycolysis correspond to an energy-investment phase in which the phosphorylated forms of intermediates are synthesized at the expense of ATP. The subsequent reactions of glycolysis constitute an energy-generation phase in which a net of two molecules of ATP are formed by substrate-level phosphorylation (see p. 102) per glucose molecule metabolized. A. Glucose phosphorylation Phosphorylated sugar molecules do not readily penetrate cell membranes because there are no specific transmembrane carriers for these compounds and because they are too polar to diffuse through the lipid core of membranes. Therefore, the irreversible phosphorylation of glucose (Fig."

SYNTHESIS The heteropolysaccharide chains are elongated by the sequential addition of alternating acidic and amino sugars donated primarily by their uridine diphosphate (UDP) derivatives. The reactions are catalyzed by a family of specific glycosyltransferases. Because GAG are produced for export from the cell, their synthesis occurs primarily in the Golgi and not in the cytosol. A. Amino sugar synthesis Amino sugars are essential components of glycoconjugates such as proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids. The synthetic pathway of amino sugars (hexosamines) is very active in connective tissues, where as much as 20% of glucose flows through this pathway."

For example, glycogen is synthesized from \u03b1-D-glucopyranose, whereas cellulose is synthesized from \u03b2-D-glucopyranose. The cyclic \u03b1 and \u03b2 anomers of a sugar in solution spontaneously (but slowly) form an equilibrium mixture, a process known as mutarotation (see Fig. 7.6). [Note: For glucose, the \u03b1 form makes up 36% of the mixture.] six-membered ring (5 C + 1 O) is termed a pyranose, whereas one with a five-membered ring (4 C + 1 O) is a furanose. Virtually all glucose in solution is in the pyranose form.] 2. Reducing sugars: If the hydroxyl group on the anomeric carbon of a cyclized sugar is not linked to another compound by a glycosidic bond (see E. below), the ring can open. The sugar can act as a reducing agent and is termed a reducing sugar. Such sugars can react with chromogenic agents (for"
