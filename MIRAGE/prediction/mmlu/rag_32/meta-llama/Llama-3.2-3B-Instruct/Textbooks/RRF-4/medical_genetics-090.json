Autozygosity mapping is a technique used to identify genetic disorders that exhibit a specific pattern of inheritance. The question asks which pattern of inheritance is mapped using autozygosity mapping. Let's evaluate the options: A. Autosomal dominant disorders do not typically exhibit the characteristics of autozygosity mapping, as they do not show a high degree of consanguinity. B. Autosomal recessive disorders can be mapped using autozygosity mapping, as they often occur in consanguineous families. C. X-linked dominant and X-linked recessive disorders are not typically mapped using autozygosity mapping, as they are not usually associated with consanguineous families. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Autosomal recessive disorders. This pattern of inheritance is often mapped using autozygosity mapping, as it is commonly seen in consanguineous families where there is a high degree of homozygosity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The continuously updated OMIM catalogue lists several thousand of these disorders and provides information about the clinical phenotype, molecular basis, allelic variants, and pertinent animal models (Table 82-1). The mode of inheritance for a given phenotypic trait or disease is determined by pedigree analysis. All affected and unaffected individuals in the family are recorded in a pedigree using standard symbols (Fig. 82-11). The principles of allelic segregation, and the transmission of alleles from parents to children, are illustrated in Fig. 82-12. One dominant (A) allele and one recessive (a) allele can display three Mendelian modes of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked.

Two fundamental principles are essential for understanding the concept of linkage: (1) when two genes are close together on a chromosome, they are usually transmitted together, unless a recombination event separates them (Figs. 82-6); and (2) the odds of a crossover, or recombination event, between two linked genes is proportional to the distance that separates them. Thus, genes that are farther apart are more likely to undergo a recombination event than genes that are very close together. The detection of chromosomal loci that segregate with a disease by linkage can be used to identify the gene responsible for the disease (positional cloning) and to predict the odds of disease gene transmission in genetic counseling."

The mutation may be large and result in duplication of a major part of a chromosome or even of the entire gene (diploidy or triploidy) or a deletion (haploidy).

Gene orientation is indicated by arrowheads. Scale is in kilobase (kb). The approximate genetic distance from DP to A is 3.2 cM. This includes 0.8 cM between A and B (including 0.2 cM between C and B), 0.4\u20130.8 cM between B and DR-DQ, and 1.6\u20132.0 cM between DR-DQ and DP."
