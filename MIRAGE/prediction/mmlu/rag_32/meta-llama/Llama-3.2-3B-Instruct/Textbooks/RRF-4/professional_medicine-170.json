    "question": "An 87-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her son because of progressive memory loss over the past 2 years. Her son says that she repeats herself frequently and has been forgetting to take her routine medications. She takes hydrochlorothiazide for mild systolic hypertension and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. She had vulvar cancer 10 years ago treated with wide excision. Her blood pressure is 138/78 mm Hg. Physical examination is within normal limits for her age. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 23/30. Laboratory studies, including serum vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations, are within normal limits. A CT scan of the head shows mild volume loss. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",

The patient presents with progressive memory loss, repetition of herself, and forgetfulness, which are common symptoms of dementia. The Mini-Mental State Examination score of 23/30 indicates cognitive impairment. The laboratory studies, including serum vitamin B12, thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations, are within normal limits, ruling out hypothyroidism as a cause of her symptoms. The CT scan of the head shows mild volume loss, which could be related to age-related atrophy. The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled, and there is no indication of an acute medical emergency. Considering the patient's symptoms and normal laboratory results, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for her dementia would be a cholinesterase inhibitor, which can help improve cognitive function and slow disease progression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

There is debate about the value of replacing thyroxine in the subclinical hypothyroidism patient. Such replacement did not result in improved survival, decreased cardiovascular morbidity, or improve quality of life (44). The mode of action is by conversion of T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues. Levothyroxine should be taken on an empty stomach. Absorption may be poor when taken in combination with aluminum hydroxide (common in antacids), cholestyramine, ferrous sulfate, or fatty meals. The usual T4 requirement is weight related (approximately 1.6 \u03bcg/kg) but decreases for the elderly. Normal daily dosage is 0.1 to 0.15 mg but should be adjusted to maintain TSH levels within the normal range. TSH levels should be checked in 6 weeks and when dosages or brands are changed."

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

Graves disease presents as hyperthyroidism (Table 175-4) and is about five times more common in girls than in boys, with a peak incidence in adolescence. Personality changes, mood instability, and poor school performance are common initial problems. Tremor, anxiety, inability to concentrate, and weight loss may be insidious and confused with a psychological disorder until thyroid function tests reveal the elevated serum free T4 level. In rare cases, serum free T4 may be near-normal whereas serum T3 is selectively elevated (T3 toxicosis). A firm homogeneous goiter is usually present. Many patients complain of neck fullness. Thyroid gland enlargement is best visualized with the neck only slightly extended and with the examiner lateral to the patient. Palpation of the thyroid gland is best performed with the examiner\u2019s hands around the neck from the back.

Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

Patients with small glands are less likely to recur, so that treatment for curative intent is reserved for patients with (a) small, nontoxic goiters less than 40 g; (b) mildly elevated thyroid hormone levels; (c) negative or low or titers of thyroid hormone receptor antibodies; and (d) rapid decrease in gland size with antithyroid medications. The catecholamine response of thyrotoxicosis can be alleviated by administering \u03b2-blocking agents. \u03b2-Blockade should be considered in all patients with symptomatic thyrotoxicosis and is recommended for elderly patients, those with coexistent cardiac disease, and patients with resting heart rates >90 bpm.
