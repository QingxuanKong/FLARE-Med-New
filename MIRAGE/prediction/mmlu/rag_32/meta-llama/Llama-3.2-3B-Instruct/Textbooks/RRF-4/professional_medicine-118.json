    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which vessel damage caused the patient's findings, we need to consider the effects of damage to different vessels in the neck during thyroidectomy. The patient's serum studies show a low calcium concentration (7.5 mg/dL) and a high parathyroid hormone concentration (200 pg/mL). These findings suggest hypocalcemia and hyperparathyroidism, respectively. Damage to the vessels that supply the parathyroid glands can lead to hypoparathyroidism, which can cause hypocalcemia. The parathyroid glands receive blood supply from the inferior thyroid artery, which is a branch of the thyrocervical trunk. The external carotid artery and its branches, including the costocervical trunk, primarily supply the neck structures such as the skin, muscles, and lymph nodes, but not the parathyroid glands. The internal jugular vein is part of the venous drainage system and is not directly involved in the arterial supply of the parathyroid glands. Therefore, damage to the thyrocervical trunk, which includes the inferior thyroid artery, is the most likely cause of the patient's hypocalcemia and hyperparathyroidism. The correct answer is C.

It was not until his seventh operation, which included total thyroidectomy, that an ectopic adenoma was found substernally. Unfortunately, Captain Martell died 6 weeks later, likely due to laryngeal spasm and complications of renal stones and ureteral obstruction. The first successful para-thyroidectomy for HPT in the United States was performed on a 56-year-old woman in 1928 by Isaac Y. Olch at the Barnes Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. At operation, a parathyroid ade-noma was found attached to the left lower lobe of the thyroid gland. Postoperatively, the patient developed tetany, requiring lifelong supplemental calcium.EmbryologyIn humans, the superior parathyroid glands are derived from the fourth branchial pouch, which also gives rise to the thyroid gland.

If the glands are totally removed, death will ensue because muscles, including the laryngeal and other respiratory muscles, go into tetanic contraction as the blood calcium level falls. PTH is an 84\u2013amino acid linear peptide (Table 21.8). It binds to a specific PTH receptor on target cells that interacts with G protein to activate a second-messenger system. PTH release causes the level of calcium in the blood to increase. Simultaneously, it reduces the concentration of serum phosphate. Secretion of PTH is regulated by the serum calcium level through a simple feedback system. When parathyroid calcium-sensing receptors on principal cells detect low serum"

Endoscopic adrenal-sparing surgery, which decreases postoperative morbidity, hospital stay, and expense, as opposed to open surgery, has become the method of choice. Parathyroid Tumors (See also Chap. 424) Parathyroid tumors occur in 10\u201325% of patients with MEN 2A. However, >50% of these patients do not have hypercalcemia. The presence of abnormally enlarged parathyroids, which are unusually hyperplastic, is often seen in the normocalcemic patient undergoing thyroidectomy for MTC. The biochemical investigation and treatment of hypercalcemic patients with MEN 2A is similar to that of patients with MEN 1."

Dur-ing subtotal thyroidectomy, remnant tissue may be left on each side (bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy), or a total lobectomy can be performed on one side with a subtotal thyroidectomy on the other side (Hartley-Dunhill procedure). Results were similar with either procedure, but the latter procedure was theoretically associated with fewer complications and requires reentering only one side of the neck should recurrence require reoperation. Most studies, however, show no difference in the rates of com-plications with either approach, although patients undergoing a total resection had higher rates of temporary hypoparathyroid-ism. However, patients treated with subtotal thyroidectomy are prone to recurrence, the rates of which are dependent on rem-nant size. Based on the current evidence, recently revised guide-lines from the American Thyroid Association (ATA) recommend total or near-total thyroidectomy as the procedure"

There is also evidence for subtle cardiovascular manifestations in mild disease, such as changes in endothelial function, increased vascular stiffness, and perhaps subtle diastolic dysfunction. Several large studies from Europe also suggest that PHPT is associated with increased death rates from cardiovascular disease and cancer even in patients with mild HPT, although this finding was not substantiated in North American studies.Physical Findings Parathyroid tumors are seldom palpable, except in patients with profound hypercalcemia or parathyroid cancer. A palpable neck mass in a patient with PHPT is more likely to be thyroid in origin or a parathyroid cancer. Patients also may demonstrate evidence of band keratopathy, a depo-sition of calcium in Bowman\u2019s membrane just inside the iris of the eye. This nonspecific condition generally is caused by chronic eye diseases such as uveitis, glaucoma, and trauma but also may"

After a variable period of hypoparathyroidism, normal parathyroid function may return due to hyperplasia or recovery of remaining tissue. Occasionally, recovery occurs months after surgery."

For patients with hyperplasia, a titanium clip is placed across the most normal gland, leaving a 50-mg rem-nant and taking care to avoid disturbing the vascular pedicle and that the gland is resected with a sharp scalpel. If possible, it is preferable to subtotally resect an inferior gland, which is more easily accessible in case of recurrence due to its anterior location with respect to the RLN. The resected parathyroid tis-sue is confirmed by frozen section or PTH assay. If the rem-nant appears to be viable, the remaining glands are resected. If there is any question as to the viability of the initially subtotally resected gland, another gland is chosen for subtotal resection, and the initial remnant is removed. Whenever multiple para-thyroids are resected, it is preferable to cryopreserve tissue, so that it may be autotransplanted should the patient become hypo-parathyroid. Parathyroid tissue usually is"
