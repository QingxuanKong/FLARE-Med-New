It is believed that the organization of DNA coding sequences as a series of such exons separated by long introns has greatly facilitated the evolution of new proteins. The duplications necessary to form a single gene coding for a protein with repeating domains, for example, can easily occur by breaking and rejoining the DNA anywhere in the long introns on either side of an exon; without introns there would be only a few sites in the original gene at which a recombinational exchange between DNA molecules could duplicate the domain and not disrupt it. By enabling the duplication to occur by recombination at many potential sites rather than just a few, introns increase the probability of a favorable duplication event."

The machinery that catalyzes pre-mRNA splicing is complex, consisting of five addi-tional RNA molecules and several hundred proteins, and it hydrolyzes many ATP molecules per splicing event. This complexity ensures that splicing is accurate, while at the same time being flexible enough to deal with the enormous variety of introns found in a typical eukaryotic cell. It may seem wasteful to remove large numbers of introns by RNA splicing. In attempting to explain why it occurs, scientists have pointed out that the exon\u2013 intron arrangement would seem to facilitate the emergence of new and useful proteins over evolutionary time scales.

Mathematical modeling explains these oscillations in terms of the delays in production of the unstable Hes7 protein, which acts as a transcription regulator to shut off its own expression. Once Hes7 decays, with a half-life of about 20 minutes, its transcription resumes. To test this model, you decide to reduce the total delay by removing one, two, or all three of the introns from the Hes7 gene in mice. Why do you expect that intron removal would reduce the delay?

As discussed above, a typical gene carries in its linear sequence of nucleotides the information for the linear sequence of the amino acids of a protein. Only about 1300 nucleotide pairs are required to encode a protein of average size (about 430 amino acids in humans). Most of the remaining sequence in a gene consists of long stretches of noncoding DNA that interrupt the relatively short segments of DNA that code for protein. As will be discussed in detail in Chapter 6, the coding sequences are called exons; the intervening (noncoding) sequences in genes are called introns (see Figure 4\u201315 and Table 4\u20131).

            "content": "Prognosis: The prognosis for recovery is excellent. Case-Related Questions: Choose the ONE best answer. Q1. Which of the following statements about vitamin C is correct? Vitamin C is: A. a competitor of iron absorption in the intestine. B. a fat-soluble vitamin with a 3-month supply typically stored in adipose tissue. C. a coenzyme in several enzymic reactions such as the hydroxylation of proline. D. required for the cross-linking of collagen. Q2. In contrast to the microcytic anemia characteristic of iron deficiency (common in older adults), a macrocytic anemia is seen with deficiencies of vitamin B12 and/or folic acid. These vitamin deficiencies are also common in older adults. Which of the following statements concerning these vitamins is correct? A. An inability to absorb B12 results in pernicious anemia. B. Both vitamins cause changes in gene expression. C. Folic acid plays a key role in energy metabolism in most cells."

(A) The relatively small \u03b2-globin gene, which encodes a subunit of the oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin, contains 3 exons (see also Figure 4\u20137). (B) The much larger Factor VIII gene contains 26 exons; it codes for a protein (Factor VIII) that functions in the blood-clotting pathway. The most prevalent form of hemophilia results from mutations in this gene."
