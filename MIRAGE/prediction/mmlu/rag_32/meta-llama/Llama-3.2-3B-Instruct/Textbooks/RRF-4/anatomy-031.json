The pharyngeal phase of swallowing involves the transfer of the bolus from the mouth to the pharynx, and then to the esophagus. During this phase, the soft palate and parts of the larynx act as valves to ensure proper movement of food from the oral cavity into the esophagus. The key mechanism that prevents food from entering the larynx is the upward movement of the epiglottis, which covers or acts as a hood over the vocal cords and prevents aspiration of food and liquid into the lower respiratory tract. This mechanism is crucial to prevent food and liquid from entering the trachea and lungs, and to ensure that the airway remains open for breathing. Therefore, the correct answer is the upward movement of the epiglottis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

This is followed by a transfer phase during which the bolus is pushed into the pharynx by the tongue. Bolus entry into the hypopharynx initiates the pharyngeal swallow response, which is centrally mediated and involves a complex series of actions, the net result of which is to propel food through the pharynx into the esophagus while preventing its entry into the airway. To accomplish this, the larynx is elevated and pulled forward, actions that also facilitate upper esophageal sphincter (UES) opening. Tongue pulsion then propels the bolus through the UES, followed by a peristaltic contraction that clears residue from the pharynx and through the esophagus. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxes as the food enters the esophagus and remains relaxed until the peristaltic contraction has delivered the bolus into the stomach. Peristaltic contractions"

A peristaltic wave is initiated with contraction of the pharyngeal superior constrictor muscles, and the wave moves toward the esophagus. This wave forces the bolus of food through the relaxed UES. During the pharyngeal stage of swallowing, respiration is also reflexively inhibited. After the bolus of food passes the UES, a reflex action causes the sphincter to constrict."

On swallowing, the oropharyngeal isthmus is opened, the palate is elevated, the laryngeal cavity is closed, and the food or liquid is directed into the esophagus. A person cannot breathe and swallow at the same time because the airway is closed at two sites, the pharyngeal isthmus and the larynx.

Activation of the superficial receptors results in apnea, cough, and expiratory movements that protect the lower respiratory tract from aspirating foreign material.

They remark that observation of the patient swallowing water and repeated observation of the patient while eating can be equally informative.

Frequently, repetitive secondary peristalsis is required to clear the esophagus of the bolus. Stimulation of the pharynx by the swallowed bolus also produces reflex relaxation of the LES and the most proximal region of the stomach. Thus when the bolus reaches the LES, it is already relaxed to allow passage of the bolus into the stomach. Similarly the portion of the stomach that receives the bolus is relaxed. In addition, esophageal distention produces further receptive relaxation of the stomach. The proximal part of the stomach relaxes at the same time as the LES; this occurs with each swallow, and its function is to allow the stomach to accommodate large volumes with a minimal rise in intragastric pressure. This process is called receptive relaxation ( Fig. 28.8"

It manipulates sounds produced by the larynx and one outcome of this is speech. It can be used for breathing because it opens into the pharynx, which is a common pathway for food and air. For this reason, the oral cavity can be used by physicians to access the lower airway, and dentists use \u201crubber dams\u201d to prevent debris such as tooth fragments from passing through the oropharyngeal isthmus and pharynx into either the esophagus or the lower airway. Multiple nerves innervate the oral cavity General sensory innervation is carried predominantly by branches of the trigeminal nerve [V]: The upper parts of the cavity, including the palate and the upper teeth, are innervated by branches of the maxillary nerve [V2]."

Salivary secretion has important functions and, together with chewing of the food, allows the formation of a bolus that can be swallowed and passed along the esophagus to the stomach. 3. The ionic composition of salivary secretion varies with the flow rate, which is stimulated during a meal. The primary secretion comes from cells in the acini and is modified by epithelial cells as it passes through the ducts. 4. Regulation of salivary secretion is exclusively neural; parasympathetic innervation is most important in the response to food. Catalan MA, et al. Salivary gland secretion. In: Johnson LR, ed.

Patients with some neuromuscular diseases have altered muscle reflexes and can lose this coordinated swallowing mechanism. Such patients may become susceptible to aspiration of food and liquid, which poses a risk for pneumonia."
