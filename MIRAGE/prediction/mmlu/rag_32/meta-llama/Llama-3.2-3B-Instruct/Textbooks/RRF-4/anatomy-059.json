Protraction is mainly achieved by the lateral pterygoid muscle, with some assistance by the medial pterygoid. Retraction is carried out by the geniohyoid and digastric muscles, and by the posterior and deep fibers of the temporalis and masseter muscles, respectively. Except for the geniohyoid muscle, which is innervated by the C1 spinal nerve, all muscles that move the temporomandibular joints are innervated by the mandibular nerve [V3] by branches that originate in the infratemporal fossa. The masseter muscle is a powerful muscle of mastication that elevates the mandible (Fig. 8.141 and Table 8.11). It overlies the lateral surface of the ramus of the mandible."

Movements of the mandible include depression, elevation, protrusion, and retraction (Fig. 8.140): Depression is generated by the digastric, geniohyoid, and mylohyoid muscles on both sides, is normally assisted by gravity, and, because it involves forward movement of the head of the mandible onto the articular tubercle, the lateral pterygoid muscles are also involved.

            "content": "General sensory innervation from the anterior two-thirds or oral part of the tongue is carried by the lingual nerve, which is a major branch of the mandibular nerve [V3]. It originates in the infratemporal fossa and passes anteriorly into the floor of the oral cavity by passing through the gap (oropharyngeal triangle) between the mylohyoid, superior constrictor, and middle constrictor muscles (Fig. 8.262). As it travels through the gap, it passes immediately inferior to the attachment of the superior constrictor to the mandible and continues forward on the medial surface of the mandible adjacent to the last molar tooth and deep to the gingiva. In this position, the nerve can be palpated against the bone by placing a finger into the oral cavity. The lingual nerve then continues anteromedially across the floor of the oral cavity, loops under the submandibular duct, and ascends into the tongue on the external and superior surface of the hyoglossus muscle."

            "content": "The mentalis helps position the lip when drinking from a cup or when pouting. It is the deepest muscle of the lower group arising from the mandible just inferior to the incisor teeth, with its fibers passing downward and medially to insert into the skin of the chin. It raises and protrudes the lower lip as it wrinkles the skin of the chin. Upper group of oral muscles The muscles of the upper group of oral muscles consist of the risorius, zygomaticus major, zygomaticus minor, levator labii superioris, levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, and levator anguli oris (Fig. 8.59). The risorius helps produce a grin (Fig. 8.59). It is a thin, superficial muscle that extends laterally from the corner of the mouth in a slightly upward direction. Contraction of its fibers pulls the corner of the mouth laterally and upward."

            "content": "The head of the mandible is anterior to the external ear and behind and inferior to the posterior end of the zygomatic arch. It is best found by opening and closing the jaw and palpating the head of the mandible as it moves forward onto the articular tubercle and then back into the mandibular fossa, respectively. The zygomatic arch extends forward from the region of the temporomandibular joint to the zygomatic bone, which forms a bony prominence lateral to the inferior margin of the anterior opening of the orbit. The mastoid process is a large bony protuberance that is easily palpable posterior to the inferior aspect of the external acoustic meatus. The superior end of the sternocleidomastoid muscle attaches to the mastoid process. The external occipital protuberance is palpable in the midline posteriorly where the contour of the skull curves sharply forward. This landmark marks the point superficially where the back of the neck joins the head."

            "content": "The final bony structure visible in a lateral view of the skull is the mandible. Inferiorly in the anterior part of this view, it consists of the anterior body of the mandible, a posterior ramus of the mandible, and the angle of the mandible where the inferior margin of the mandible meets the posterior margin of the ramus (Fig. 8.19). The teeth are in the alveolar part of the body of the mandible and the mental protuberance is visible in this view. The mental foramen is on the lateral surface of the body, and on the superior part of the ramus condylar and coronoid processes extend upward. The condylar process is involved in articulation of the mandible with the temporal bone, and the coronoid process is the point of attachment for the temporalis muscle. The occipital, parietal, and temporal bones are seen in the posterior view of the skull."

The parotid glands are the largest of the three pairs of main salivary glands in the head and numerous structures pass through them. They are anterior to and below the lower half of the ear, superficial, posterior, and deep to the ramus of the mandible (Fig. 8.62). They extend down to the lower border of the mandible and up to the zygomatic arch. Posteriorly they cover the anterior part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and continue anteriorly to halfway across the masseter muscle."
