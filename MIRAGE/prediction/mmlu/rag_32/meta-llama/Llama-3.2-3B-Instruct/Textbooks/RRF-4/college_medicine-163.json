With each sprint, the muscle undergoes anaerobic metabolism to generate rapid energy. This leads to increased production of lactic acid and a decrease in pH levels. As the number of sprints increases, the muscle's ability to utilize aerobic metabolism decreases, and the anaerobic contribution becomes more significant. Therefore, the correct answer can be deduced by eliminating options C and D, which relate to aerobic metabolism and blood glucose concentration, respectively. Option B, which mentions a pH fall below 6.0, is a consequence of increased anaerobic metabolism, but it is not the most direct answer to the question. The correct answer is A, which states that the anaerobic contribution progressively increases with an increasing number of sprints.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

These motor units contain slow-twitch fibers and thus generate the smallest contractile force, allowing the initial contraction to be finely graded. These units tend to be active much of the time, if not continuously, and so their lack of fatigability makes good functional sense. As more motor units are recruited for a motor act, motor neurons with progressively larger axons become involved, and these axons synapse onto the fast-twitch fibers. Thus they generate progressively larger amounts of tension. The most powerful such motor units are typically recruited only for tasks requiring large amounts of force (e.g., sprinting, jumping, and lifting a heavy weight), tasks that people can perform for only for short periods of time."

Moreover, the small size of slow-twitch motor units allows fine motor control at low levels of force.

The low ATPase activity of myosin in slow motor units, coupled with their high oxidative capacity, facilitates the ability of these slow motor units to maintain posture at low energy cost and thus resist fatigue. The smaller diameter of slow muscle fibers, and the higher capillary density in slow muscle, also helps slow muscle resist fatigue. Fast muscle, in contrast, is recruited for activities that require faster movements, more force, or both (see Fig. 12.15 ). Weightlifting, for example, can require a lot of power for short duration.

However, statistical approaches made possible by detailed analysis of cancer cells suggest (as might be expected) that aneuploidy tends to increase the copy number of key oncogenes and decrease the copy number of potent tumor suppressors. For example, chromosome 8, which almost never is lost and often is present in increased copies in tumor cells, is where the MYC oncogene is located. By contrast, portions of chromosome 17, where the TP53 gene is located, are often lost and are infrequently gained. Thus, tumor development and progression may be molded by changes in chromosome numbers that enhance the dosage of oncogenes while restricting the activity of tumor suppressor genes."

Thus V0 for fast-twitch muscle is higher than that for slow-twitch muscle.

            "content": "Set originally rather arbitrarily at 7 days, the interval between tests appears to have been shortened as experience evolved with nonstress testing. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2016), more frequent testing is advocated by some investigators for women with postterm pregnancy, multifetal gestation, pregestational diabetes, fetalgrowth restriction, or pregnancy hypertension. In these circumstances, some investigators perform twice-weekly tests, with additional testing completed for maternal or fetal deterioration regardless of the time elapsed since the last test. Others perform nonstress tests daily or even more frequently, such as with severe preeclampsia remote from term."

            "content": "positions ofered a slightly shorter interval to delivery as well as fewer episiotomies and operative vaginal deliveries. However, rates of blood loss > 500 mL and perhaps of second-degree lacerations were increased. Berghella and coworkers (2008) hypothesized that parity, less intense aortocaval compression, improved fetal alignment, and larger pelvic outlet diameters might explain these indings. In an earlier study, a 20-to 30-percent increase in the area of the pelvic outlet was noted with squatting compared with the supine position (Russell, 1969). Finally, Babayer and associates (1998) cautioned that prolonged sitting or squatting during the second stage may cause neuropathy of the common fibular (formerly common peroneal) nerve."
