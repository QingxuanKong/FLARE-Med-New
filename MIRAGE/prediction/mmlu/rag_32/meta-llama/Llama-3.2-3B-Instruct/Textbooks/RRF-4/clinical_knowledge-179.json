The primary energy sources for muscle contraction are ATP, phosphocreatine (PCr), and glycolysis. However, during very high force contractions, the energy demands are extremely high, and the energy sources are depleted quickly. ATP stores are rapidly depleted during such contractions, and glycolysis cannot provide enough energy to sustain the contraction. Phosphocreatine stores are also depleted quickly, as they are rapidly hydrolyzed to replenish ATP. Therefore, the initial energy source for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds is not ATP or phosphocreatine. The correct answer is glycolysis, which can provide a rapid source of energy through anaerobic glycolysis of stored glycogen. This process occurs in rapidly contracting muscles, such as the leg muscles in running or the extraocular muscles, and can provide a temporary energy source to support high-force contractions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

A single action potential releases sufficient Ca++ to cause a twitch contraction. However, the duration of this contraction is very short because Ca++ is very rapidly pumped back into the SR. If the muscle is stimulated a second time before it is fully relaxed, the force of contraction increases (see Fig. 12.16 , middle). Thus twitch forces are amplified as stimulus frequency increases. At a high level of stimulation, intracellular [Ca++] increases and is maintained throughout the period of stimulation (see Fig. 12.16 , right), and the amount of force developed greatly exceeds that observed during a twitch. The response is termed tetany. At intermediate stimulus frequency, intracellular [Ca++] returns to baseline just before the next stimulus. However, there is a gradual rise in force (see"

In contrast, during a tonic contraction, myoplasmic [Ca++] and cross-bridge phosphorylation decline after an initial spike but do not return to baseline levels. During this later phase, force slowly increases and is sustained at a high level (see Fig. 14.9). This sustained force is maintained with only 20% to 30% of the cross-bridges phosphorylated, and thus ATP utilization is reduced. The term latch state refers to this condition of tonic contraction during which force is maintained at low energy expenditure."

The effects of changes in contraction frequency on the force developed in an isometrically contracting papillary muscle are shown in Fig. 18.14 . Initially, the cardiac muscle is stimulated to contract once every 20 seconds. When the muscle is suddenly made to contract once every 0.63 seconds, the force developed increases progressively over the next several beats. At the new steady state, the force developed is more than five times greater than the force at the larger contraction interval. A return to the larger interval (20 seconds) has the opposite influence on the development of force."

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor. In contrast, the slow motor units are able to meet the energy demands of fibers under this condition, and they do not exhibit significant fatigue, even after many hours. Evidently, some factor associated with energy metabolism can inhibit contraction (e.g., in the fast fibers), but this factor has not been clearly identified."

Specifically, when the muscle is stretched a small amount shortly after initiation of the action potential, the muscle generates a twitch force that approximates the maximal tetanic force. This result, coupled with the observation that the size of the intracellular Ca++ transient during a twitch contraction is comparable with that during tetany, suggests that enough Ca++ is released into the myoplasm during a twitch to allow the actin-myosin interactions to produce maximal tension. However, the duration of the intracellular Ca++ transient during a twitch is sufficiently short that the contractile elements may not have enough time to fully stretch the series elastic components in the fiber and muscle. As a result, the measured tension is submaximal."

The advantage of such a recruitment strategy is that the first muscle fibers recruited are those that have high resistance to fatigue. Moreover, the small size of slow-twitch motor units allows fine motor control at low levels of force. The process of increasing the force of contraction by recruiting additional motor units is termed spatial summation because forces from muscle fibers are being \u201csummed\u201d within a larger area of the muscle.

Instead, metabolic byproducts seem to be important factors in the onset of fatigue. Fatigue may potentially occur at any of the points involved in muscle contraction, from the brain to the muscle cells, as well as in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems that maintain energy supplies (i.e., fatty acids and glucose) and oxygen delivery to the exercising muscle.

Immediately upon arrival of the signal, the muscle cell needs to be able to contract very rapidly, with all the sarcomeres shortening simultaneously. Two major features of the muscle cell make extremely rapid contraction possible. First, as previously discussed, the individual myosin motor heads in each thick filament spend only a small fraction of the ATP cycle time bound to the filament and actively generating force, so many myosin heads can act in rapid succession on the same thin filament without interfering with one another. Second, a specialized membrane system relays the incoming signal rapidly throughout the entire cell.

The increase in force during tetanic contractions is due to prolonged elevation of intracellular [Ca++]. 5. The two basic types of skeletal muscle fibers are distinguished on the basis of their speed of contraction (i.e., fast-twitch versus slow-twitch). The difference in speed of contraction is attributed to the expression of different myosin isoforms that differ in myosin ATPase activity. In addition to the difference in myosin ATPase activity, fast-and slow-twitch muscles also differ in metabolic activity, fiber diameter, motor unit size, sensitivity to tetany, and recruitment pattern. 6."

Although this approach of varying extracellular [Ca++] to alter the force of contraction is demonstrable in vitro, it is not a common means of modulating the force of cardiac contraction in vivo.

These motor units contain slow-twitch fibers and thus generate the smallest contractile force, allowing the initial contraction to be finely graded. These units tend to be active much of the time, if not continuously, and so their lack of fatigability makes good functional sense. As more motor units are recruited for a motor act, motor neurons with progressively larger axons become involved, and these axons synapse onto the fast-twitch fibers. Thus they generate progressively larger amounts of tension. The most powerful such motor units are typically recruited only for tasks requiring large amounts of force (e.g., sprinting, jumping, and lifting a heavy weight), tasks that people can perform for only for short periods of time."
