    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to identify the condition that causes female pseudohermaphroditism. Female pseudohermaphroditism is a condition where the external genitalia of a female appear male-like due to excessive androgen exposure during fetal development. Let's analyze each option: A. Androgen insensitivity: This is a condition where the body is unable to respond to androgens, resulting in a female phenotype despite XY chromosomes. It is not a cause of female pseudohermaphroditism. B. Campomelic dysplasia: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects bone development, but it is not typically associated with female pseudohermaphroditism. C. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia: This is a group of inherited disorders that affect the adrenal glands, leading to excessive androgen production. If a female fetus is exposed to high levels of androgens during fetal development, it can cause female pseudohermaphroditism. D. Klinefelter syndrome: This is a genetic condition that affects males, characterized by an extra X chromosome (47,XXY). It is not a cause of female pseudohermaphroditism. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, as it is a common cause of female pseudohermaphroditism due to excessive androgen production during fetal development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Males with pseudohermaphroditism are genetic males with feminized external genitalia, most commonly manifesting as hypospadias (urethral opening on the ventral surface of the penis) or incomplete fusion of the urogenital or labioscrotal folds. Females with pseudohermaphroditism are genetic females with virilized external genitalia, including clitoral hypertrophy and some degree of fusion of the urogenital or labioscrotal folds. Both types of pseudohermaphroditism are caused either by abnormal levels of sex hormones or abnormalities in the sex hormone receptors. Another major category of genital tract abnormalities involves various types of uterovaginal malformations, which occur in 0.16% of women (Fig. 5.13) (26). These malformations are believed to result from one or more of the following situations: 1."

These disorders may be recognized by their characteristic phenotypes, and in many instances the diagnosis may be confirmed by genetic analysis. Several inherited defects in adrenal steroid biosynthesis and metabolism result in mineralocorticoid-induced hypertension and hypokalemia. In patients with a 17\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency, synthesis of sex hormones and cortisol is decreased (Fig. 298-3). Consequently, these individuals do not mature sexually; males may present with pseudohermaphroditism and females with primary amenorrhea and absent secondary sexual characteristics. Because cortisol-induced negative feedback on pituitary ACTH production is diminished, ACTH-stimulated adrenal steroid synthesis proximal to the enzymatic block is increased. Hypertension and hypokalemia are consequences of increased synthesis of mineralocorticoids"

The Leydig cells in these individuals are unable to respond to LH, causing Leydig cell hypoplasia. This leads to early testicular failure and prevents masculinization.

Because there is theoretical concern that medroxyprogesterone acetate used in early pregnancy may increase the incidence of pseudohermaphroditism, a pregnancy test should be obtained if a woman fails to have a withdrawal bleed (128). Alternatively, progesterone suppositories (50 to 100 mg) or oral micronized progesterone (200 mg) can be given for 12 to 14 days per month to protect the endometrium from hyperplasia and induce withdrawal bleeding.

True Hermaphroditism Individuals with true hermaphroditism have both ovarian and testicular tissue, most commonly as composite ovotestes but occasionally with an ovary on one side and a testis on the other. In the latter case, a fallopian tube and single uterine horn may develop on the side with the ovary because of the absence of local AMH.

The degree of virilization can range from mild clitoral enlargement to the appearance of a male phallus with a penile urethra and fused scrotum with raphe. Congenital virilizing adrenal hyperplasia is the most common cause of female ambiguous genitalia; it is most commonly the result of an enzyme deficiency that impairs synthesis of glucocorticoids but does not affect androgen production. The impaired cortisol secretion leads to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) hypersecretion, which stimulates hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex and excessive adrenal production of androgens (see Chapter 178). 46,XY Disorders of Sexual Development Available @ StudentConsult.com"

At 56 hours, she started showing focal seizure activity. The plasma ammonia level was found to be 887 \u00b5mol/l (normal 5\u201335 \u00b5mol/l). Quantitative plasma amino acid levels revealed a marked elevation of citrulline but not argininosuccinate. 9.3. Which one of the following enzymic activities is most likely to be deficient in this patient? A. Arginase B. Argininosuccinate lyase C. Argininosuccinate synthetase D. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I"

            "content": "Described briefly next are two disorders, Klinefelter syndrome and Turner syndrome, that result from aberrations of sex chromosomes. Klinefelter syndrome is defined as male hypogonadism that develops when there are at least two X chromosomes and one or more Y chromosomes. It is the most common cause of hypogonadism in males. Most affected patients have a 47,XXY karyotype. This karyotype results from non-disjunction of sex chromosomes during meiosis. The extra X chromosome may be of either maternal or paternal origin. Advanced maternal age and a history of irradiation in either parent may contribute to the meiotic error resulting in this condition. Approximately 15% of the patients show mosaic patterns, including 46,XY/47,XXY, 47,XXY/48,XXXY, and variations on this theme. The presence of a 46,XY line in mosaics usually is associated with a milder clinical condition."

Because of these variations, it is sometimes challenging to determine the pattern of inheritance. It should be recognized, however, that some individuals acquire a mutated gene from an unaffected parent. De novo germline mutations occur more frequently during later cell divisions in gametogenesis, which explains why siblings are rarely affected. As noted before, new germline mutations occur more frequently in fathers of advanced age. For example, the average age of fathers with new germline mutations that cause Marfan\u2019s syndrome is ~37 years, whereas fathers who transmit the disease by inheritance have an average age of ~30 years."

In some instances, this is because the gene resides on the X or Y sex chromosomes (X-linked disorders and Y-linked disorders). As a result, the phenotype of mutated X-linked genes will be expressed fully in males but variably in heterozygous females, depending on the degree of X-inactivation and the function of the gene. For example, most heterozygous female carriers of factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) are asymptomatic because sufficient factor VIII is produced to prevent a defect in coagulation (Chap. 141). On the other hand, some females heterozygous for the X-linked lipid storage defect caused by \u03b1-galactosidase A deficiency (Fabry\u2019s disease) experience mild manifestations of painful neuropathy, as well as other features of the disease (Chap. 432e). Because only males have a Y chromosome, mutations in genes such as SRY, which causes male-to-female sex reversal, or DAZ (deleted in"
