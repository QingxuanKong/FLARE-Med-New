Amniocentesis: This is a prenatal test in which a small amount of amniotic fluid is withdrawn from around the baby and examined for certain markers, such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Elevated levels of AFP can indicate the presence of a neural tube defect. Therefore, amniocentesis is of value in diagnosing neural tube defects.\\n\\nB. Chorion villus sampling (CVS): This is a prenatal test that involves removing a small sample of cells from the placenta to check for genetic disorders. CVS can also detect neural tube defects by analyzing the presence of AFP and other markers. Thus, CVS is of value in diagnosing neural tube defects.\\n\\nC. Maternal serum screening: This test measures the levels of AFP in the mother's blood to screen for neural tube defects. However, this test has a low sensitivity and specificity, and its results can be influenced by various factors. Nevertheless, it is still used as a screening tool to identify women at risk of having a neural tube defect. Therefore, maternal serum screening is of value in identifying potential neural tube defects.\\n\\nD. Ultrasonography: This is the imaging technique used to visualize the fetus and detect structural abnormalities, including neural tube defects. Targeted sonography can detect open neural tube defects, such as myelomeningocele, and spina bifida. Thus, ultrasonography is of value in diagnosing neural tube defects.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, all options A, B, C, and D have some level of value in diagnosing neural tube defects, either as screening tests or diagnostic tests.

Partial failure or reversal of neural tube closure may lead to several malformations, each characterized by abnormalities involving neural tissue, meninges, and overlying bone or soft tissues. Collectively, neural tube defects are the most frequent type of CNS malformation. Folate deficiency during the first trimester sharply increases risk through uncertain mechanisms and represents an important opportunity for prevention, as administration of folate to women of child-bearing age reduces the incidence of neural tube defects by up to 70%. The combination of imaging studies and maternal screening for elevated \u03b1fetoprotein has increased the early detection of neural tube defects. Neural tube defects include the following:"

These can range from asymptomatic bony defects (spina bifida occulta) to spina bifida, a severe malformation consisting of a flat, disorganized segment of spinal cord associated with an overlying meningeal outpouching. Myelomeningocele is an extension of CNS tissue through a defect in the vertebral column that occurs most commonly in the lumbosacral region ( Fig. 23.14 ). Patients have motor and sensory deficits in the lower extremities and problems with bowel and bladder control. The clinical problems derive from the abnormal spinal cord segment and often are compounded by infections extending from the thin or ulcerated overlying skin. Anencephaly is a malformation of the anterior end of the neural tube that leads to the absence of the forebrain and the top of the skull. Varying amounts of posterior fossa structures may be present."

Visualization of the fetus, for example, by ultrasound or fiberoptic devices (fetoscopy), is useful only if the genetic abnormality results in gross anatomic defects (for example, neural tube defects [NTD]). The chemical composition of the amniotic fluid can also provide diagnostic clues. For example, the presence of high levels of \u03b1fetoprotein is associated with NTD. Fetal cells obtained from amniotic fluid or from biopsy of the chorionic villi can be used for karyotyping, which assesses the morphology of metaphase chromosomes. Staining and cell sorting techniques permit the rapid identification of trisomies and translocations that produce an extra chromosome or chromosomes of abnormal lengths. However, molecular analysis of fetal DNA provides the most detailed genetic picture. 2."

            "content": "Most of the severe disorders are sporadic, and the infants seldom survive for long. In a few of the malformations, a congenital infection with CMV or rubella has been implicated (Hayward et al). The Dandy-Walker syndrome represents a more restricted form of migration and neural tube defect. There is cerebellar vermian hypoplasia with or without hydrocephalus and, in some cases, an added agenesis of the corpus callosum with cerebral cortical dysgeneses (Landrieu). This defect, which is identified by the cystic enlargement of the fourth ventricle, is discussed further on, with the dysraphic neural tube defects."

            "content": "Occasionally, a diagnosis of EA-TEF can be suspected prenatally on US evaluation. Typical features include failure to visualize the stomach and the pres-ence of polyhydramnios. These findings reflect the absence of efficient swallowing by the fetus.In a child with esophageal atresia, it is important to iden-tify whether coexisting anomalies are present. These include cardiac defects in 38%, skeletal defects in 19%, neurologi-cal defects in 15%, renal defects in 15%, anorectal defects in 8%, and other abnormalities in 13%. Examination of the heart and great vessels with echocardiography is important to exclude cardiac defects, as these are often the most important predictors of survival in these infants. The echocardiogram also demonstrates whether the aortic arch is left sided or right sided, which may influence the approach to surgical repair. Vertebral anomalies are assessed by plain radiography, and a spinal US is obtained if any are detected. A patent anus should be confirmed"

            "content": "Multifactorial inheritance, which implies the interaction of environmental influences with two or more genes of small effect, is the most common genetic cause of congenital malformations. Included in this category are some relatively common malformations such as cleft lip and palate and neural tube defects. The importance of environmental contributions to multifactorial inheritance is underscored by the dramatic reduction in the incidence of neural tube defects by periconceptional intake of folic acid in the diet. The recurrence risks and mode of transmission of multifactorial disorders are described earlier in this chapter. The pathogenesis of congenital anomalies is complex and still poorly understood, but two general principles are relevant regardless of the etiologic agent: 1. The timing of the prenatal teratogenic insult has an important impact on the occurrence and the type of anomaly produced."
