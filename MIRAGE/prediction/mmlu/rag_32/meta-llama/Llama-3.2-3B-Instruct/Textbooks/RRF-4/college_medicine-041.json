    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's analyze the information provided by the documents. First, we need to identify the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis. According to Document [2], the energy-generation phase of glycolysis results in a net gain of 2 molecules of ATP per glucose molecule. Next, we need to determine the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation from glycogen. Document [13] states that the conversion of glucose 1-phosphate residues from glycogen to glucose 6-phosphate yields the equivalent of 37 mol of ATP per mole of glucose 1-phosphate. Since glycogen 1-phosphate is the substrate for glycolysis, we can assume that the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation from glycogen is also 2 molecules per glucose 1-phosphate. Now, we need to determine the number of glucose 1-phosphate molecules produced from glycogen. Document [13] states that the conversion of glucose 1-phosphate residues from glycogen yields 1 glucose 1-phosphate per glycogen molecule. Therefore, the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation from glycogen is 2 molecules per glycogen molecule. However, Document [1] states that glycolysis produces 2 molecules of ATP per glucose molecule, and glycolysis is the energy-yielding pathway that uses glucose 1-phosphate as a substrate. Therefore, the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation from glycogen is 2 molecules per glycogen molecule. Now, let's analyze the options: A. 2 from glucose and 3 from glycogen. This option is incorrect because the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation from glycogen is 2 molecules, not 3. B. 2 from glucose and 4 from glycogen. This option is incorrect because the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation from glycogen is 2 molecules, not 4. C. 3 from glucose and 2 from glycogen. This option is incorrect because the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation from glycogen is 2 molecules, not 2. D. 2 from glucose and 2 from glycogen. This option is correct because the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation from glycogen is 2 molecules. The final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis is 2 molecules from glucose and 2 molecules from glycogen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Energy yield from glycolysis Despite the production of some ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation during glycolysis, the end product, pyruvate or lactate, still contains most of the energy originally contained in glucose.

Anaerobic glycolysis: A net of two molecules of ATP are generated for each molecule of glucose converted to two molecules of lactate (Fig. 8.22). There is no net production or consumption of NADH. 2. Aerobic glycolysis: The generation of ATP is the same as in anaerobic glycolysis (that is, a net gain of two ATP per molecule of glucose). Two molecules of NADH are also produced per molecule of glucose. Ongoing aerobic glycolysis requires the oxidation of most of this NADH by the ETC, producing three ATP for each NADH molecule entering the chain (see p. 77). [Note: NADH cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane, and substrate shuttles are required (see p. 79).]"

Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis in cells with mitochondria and an adequate supply of O2. This series of ten reactions is called aerobic glycolysis because O2 is required to reoxidize the NADH formed during the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Fig. 8.9B). Aerobic glycolysis sets the stage for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, a major fuel of the TCA cycle.

            "content": "http://ebooksmedicine.net The answer to this riddle is simple: Aerobic glycolysis provides rapidly dividing tumor cells with metabolic intermediates that are needed for the synthesis of cellular components, whereas mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation does not. The reason growing cells rely on aerobic glycolysis becomes readily apparent when one considers that a growing cell has a strict biosynthetic requirement; it must duplicate all of its cellular components\u2014DNA, RNA, proteins, lipid, and organelles\u2014before it can divide and produce two daughter cells. While oxidative phosphorylation yields abundant ATP, it fails to produce any carbon moieties that can be used to build the cellular components needed for growth (proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids). Even cells that are not actively growing must shunt some metabolic intermediates away from oxidative phosphorylation in order to synthesize macromolecules that are needed for cellular maintenance."

            "content": "CHAPTER 16 Elements of Cardiac Function acids are generally used in direct proportion to their arterial concentration. Ketone bodies, especially acetoacetate, are readily oxidized by the heart, and they are a major source of energy in diabetic acidosis. As is true of carbohydrate substrates, use of a specific noncarbohydrate is influenced by the presence of other substrates, whether noncarbohydrate or carbohydrate. Therefore, within certain limits, the heart preferentially uses the substrate that is available in the largest concentration. The oxidation of amino acids makes a small contribution to myocardial energy expenditure. Normally, the heart derives its energy by oxidative phosphorylation, in which each mole of glucose yields 36 mol of ATP. However, during hypoxia, glycolysis takes over, and 2 mol of ATP is provided by each mole of glucose; \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids is also curtailed. If hypoxia is prolonged, cellular creatine phosphate and eventually ATP are depleted."

Understandably, normal tissues with a greater glycolytic capacity because of the presence of glycogen (e.g., the liver and striated muscle) are more likely to survive hypoxia and decreased oxidative phosphorylation than tissues with limited glucose stores (e.g., the brain). Although it seems counterintuitive, rapidly proliferating normal cells and cancer cells rely on aerobic glycolysis to produce much of their energy, a phenomenon referred to as the Warburg effect. The reason for this is that although glycolysis yields less ATP per molecule of glucose burned than oxidative phosphorylation, metabolites generated by glycolysis and the TCA cycle serve as precursors for the synthesis of cellular constituents (e.g., proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids) that are needed for cell growth and division. Alterations in cellular metabolism are frequently seen in cancer cells, so they are discussed in more detail in Chapter 6."

This feedforward (instead of the more usual feedback) regulation has the effect of linking the two kinase activities: increased PFK-1 activity results in elevated levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, which activates PK. [Note: PK is inhibited by ATP.] 2. Covalent regulation in the liver: Phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent PKA leads to inactivation of the hepatic isozyme of PK (Fig. 8.19). When blood glucose levels are low, elevated glucagon increases the intracellular level of cAMP, which causes the phosphorylation and inactivation of PK in the liver only. Therefore, PEP is unable to continue in glycolysis and, instead, enters the gluconeogenesis pathway. This partly explains the observed inhibition of hepatic glycolysis and stimulation of gluconeogenesis by glucagon. Dephosphorylation of PK by a phosphatase results in reactivation of the enzyme. diphosphate."

Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is cleaved to form two trioses that are further metabolized by the glycolytic pathway, forming pyruvate. During this phase, four ATP and two nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) are produced per glucose molecule. The final step in pyruvate synthesis from phosphoenolpyruvate is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase (PK). This enzyme is allosterically activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and the hepatic isozyme is inhibited covalently by glucagon via the cAMP pathway. PK deficiency accounts for the majority of all inherited defects in glycolytic enzymes. Effects are restricted to RBC and present as mild-tosevere chronic, nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Glycolytic gene transcription is enhanced by insulin and glucose. In anaerobic glycolysis, NADH is reoxidized to NAD+ by the reduction of pyruvate to lactate via lactate dehydrogenase.
