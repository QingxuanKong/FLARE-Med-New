According to the provided documents, noradrenaline is released by postganglionic sympathetic fibers. Therefore, we need to identify the structure that noradrenaline acts between. The autonomic nervous system is divided into two main parts: the craniosacral (parasympathetic) and the thoracolumbar (sympathetic) systems. The sympathetic system has postganglionic neurons that release noradrenaline. The target organs of these postganglionic neurons are primarily the adrenergic receptors on the target organs. So, we need to choose the option that involves the postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic system and their target organs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

As noted, some sympathetic fibers release acetylcholine. Dopamine is a very important transmitter in the CNS, and it may be released by some peripheral sympathetic fibers under certain circumstances. Adrenal medullary cells, which are embryologically analogous to post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons, release a mixture of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Finally, most autonomic nerves also release several cotransmitter substances (described in the following text), in addition to the primary transmitters just described. Five key features of neurotransmitter function provide potential targets for pharmacologic therapy: synthesis, storage, release, termination of action of the transmitter, and receptor effects. These processes are discussed next."

Among the amines known to act as neurotransmitters are dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), epinephrine (adrenaline), serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), and histamine. Dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are catecholamines, and they share a common biosynthetic pathway that starts with the amino acid tyrosine. Tyrosine is converted to L-dopa by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. L-Dopa is then converted to dopamine by dopa-decarboxylase. In dopaminergic neurons, the pathway stops here. In noradrenergic neurons, another enzyme, dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase, converts dopamine to norepinephrine. Epinephrine is obtained by adding a methyl group to norepinephrine via phenylethanolamineN-methyl transferase. In serotoninergic neurons, serotonin is synthesized from the essential amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan is first converted to 5-hydroxytryptophan"

Finally, there should be specific receptors for it on the postsynaptic membrane. This last criterion is certainly true for substances that act as synaptic transmitters, but if we want to be inclusive and include substances that act over widespread territories rather than just at a single synapse, the last criterion needs to be relaxed to include situations in which receptors are located at sites outside the synapse.
