    "predict": "To solve this problem, we need to convert the dose from milligrams (mg) to grams (g) and then calculate the daily dose. Step 1: Convert the dose from milligrams (mg) to grams (g) 1 gram (g) = 1000 milligrams (mg) 960 mg \u00f7 1000 = 0.96 g Step 2: Calculate the daily dose The dose is prescribed every 12 hours, so there are 2 doses per day. Daily dose = 0.96 g \u00d7 2 = 1.92 g Therefore, the daily dose of Cotrimoxazole is 1.92 g. Here is the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To convert the dose from milligrams (mg) to grams (g), we divide 960 mg by 1000 mg/g. This gives us 0.96 g. Then, we calculate the daily dose by multiplying 0.96 g by 2 (since the dose is given every 12 hours), resulting in 1.92 g.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

A single daily 1-g dose is sufficient for most serious infections, with 2 g every 12 hours recommended for treatment of meningitis and 2 g every 24 hours recommended for endocarditis. The remaining drugs in the group (half-life 1\u20131.7 hours) can be infused every 6\u20138 hours in dosages between 2 and 12 g/d, depending on the severity of infection. Cefixime can be given orally (200 mg twice daily or 400 mg once daily) for urinary tract infections. Due to increasing resistance, cefixime is no longer recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis. Intramuscular ceftriaxone in combination with azithromycin is the regimen of choice for treating most gonococcal infections.

            "content": "Initial therapy for meningitis due to Hib should consist of a cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. For children, the dosage of ceftriaxone is 75\u2013100 mg/kg daily given in two doses 12 h apart. The pediatric dosage of cefotaxime is 200 mg/kg daily given in four doses 6 h apart. Adult dosages are 2 g every 12 h for ceftriaxone and 2 g every 4\u20136 h for cefotaxime. An alternative regimen for initial therapy is ampicillin (200\u2013300 mg/kg daily in four divided doses) plus chloramphenicol (75\u2013100 mg/kg daily in four divided doses). Therapy should continue for a total of 1\u20132 weeks."

A 5to 7-day course of therapy with gentamicin and a 3-week course of TMP-SMX may be adequate for children with uncomplicated disease, but prospective trials are still needed to support this recommendation. Early experience with fluoroquinolone monotherapy was disappointing, although it was suggested that ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin, given together with rifampin for 6 weeks, might be an acceptable alternative to the other 6-week regimens for adults. A substantial meta-analysis did not support the use of fluoroquinolones in first-line treatment regimens, and these drugs are not recommended by an expert consensus group (Ioannina) except in the context of well-designed clinical trials. However, a more recent meta-analysis is more supportive of the efficacy of these drugs, and an adequately powered prospective study will be needed to resolve their role in standard combination therapy."

            "content": "Acute Pyelonephritis The clinical spectrum of acute, uncomplicated pyelonephritis in young women ranges from gram-negative septicemia to a cystitislike illness with mild \ufb02ank pain. E. coli accounts for more than 80% of these cases (58). Microscopy of unspun urine reveals pyuria and gram-negative bacteria. A urine culture should be obtained in all women with suspected pyelonephritis; blood cultures should be performed in those who are hospitalized because results are positive in 15% to 20% of cases. In the absence of nausea and vomiting and severe illness, outpatient oral therapy can be given safely. Patients who have nausea and vomiting, are moderately to severely ill, or are pregnant should be hospitalized. Outpatient treatment regimens include trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg every 12 hours for 14 days) or a quinolone (e.g., levo\ufb02oxacin, 750 mg daily for 7 days). Inpatient treatment regimens include the use of parenteral levo\ufb02oxacin (750 mg daily), ceftriaxone (1\u20132 g"

Demeclocycline is rarely used as an antibacterial, but it has been used off-label in the treatment of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone because of its inhibition of antidiuretic hormone in the renal tubule (see Chapter 15)."

For drugs whose killing action is time-dependent, bactericidal activity continues as long as serum concentrations are greater than the MBC."

Its mechanism of action is the same as that of erythromycin. Clarithromycin and erythromycin are similar with respect to antibacterial activity except that clarithromycin is more active against Mycobacterium avium complex (see Chapter 47). Clarithromycin also has activity against Mycobacterium leprae, Toxoplasma gondii, and H influenzae. Erythromycinresistant streptococci and staphylococci are also resistant to clarithromycin. A 500-mg dose of clarithromycin produces serum concentrations of 2\u20133 mcg/mL. The longer half-life of clarithromycin (6 hours) compared with erythromycin permits twice-daily dosing. The recommended dosage is 250\u2013500 mg twice daily or 1000 mg of the extended-release formulation once daily. Clarithromycin penetrates most tissues well, with concentrations equal to or exceeding serum concentrations."
