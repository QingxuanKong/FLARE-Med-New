Option A, heroin (opiates), is a known cause of confusion, but it is not the most common. Option B, ecstasy (MDMA), is also a cause of confusion, but it is not as common as other substances. Option C, alcohol, is a significant cause of confusion, particularly in elderly patients, and is often implicated in cases of delirium.

Presumably, the liability to this state is determined by preexisting brain disease, most often Alzheimer disease but sometimes Parkinson disease, multiple small deep cerebral infarctions, or another dementing process, which may or may not have been obvious to the family before. All the clinical features that one observes in the acute confusional states may be present, but their severity varies greatly. Confusion may be reflected only in the patient\u2019s inability to relate the history of the illness sequentially, or it may be so severe that the patient is virtually non compos mentis.

The most distinctive syndromes are those from drugs that have direct or indirect anticholinergic properties. The delirium associated with these agents is centrally mediated but may be accompanied by peripheral anticholinergic manifestations. This point is critical in the differential assessment of agitated confusional states because other compounds, particularly serotonergic agents used to treat depression, also can produce delirium. Thus, in addition to confusion, toxic levels of anticholinergic compounds typically cause dry skin, dry mouth, diminished bowel motility, and urinary hesitancy, if not frank retention.

A large number of compounds may reduce alertness to the point of profound somnolence or stupor, particularly if there are underlying medical problems (e.g., a liver failure). Prominent in lists of iatrogenic drug intoxications are sedatives, antiepileptic drugs, opiates, certain antibiotics, antidepressants, and antipsychosis compounds. From an initial survey, many of the common causes of coma, such as severe head injury, alcoholism or other forms of drug intoxication, and hypertensive brain hemorrhage, are readily recognized. Following this, the basic electrolyte, glucose and renal function tests are established as a derangement of any of these may lead to stupor or coma. In certain circumstances a toxicology screen may be added, as if the patient is being seen the first time in an emergency setting."

Death from poisoning is because of respiratory depression and hypotension; patients who survive may show signs of liver and kidney disease. Combining alcohol and chloral hydrate, the popular \u201cMickey-Finn\u201d of detective stories in the mid-last century, produced severe intoxication and amnesia.

Asterixis is a common feature if a metabolic or toxic encephalopathy is responsible for the confusional state. In the most advanced stages of the illness, confusion gives way to stupor and, finally, to coma (see Chap. 16). With improvement in the underlying condition, they may pass again through the stages of stupor and confusion in the reverse order.

Three major clinical syndromes can be recognized. One is an acute confusional state in which there is manifest reduction in alertness and psychomotor activity. A second syndrome, alluded to as a special form of confusion, delirium, is marked by overactivity, sleeplessness, tremulousness, and prominence of vivid hallucinations, sometimes with excessive sympathetic activity. These two illnesses tend to develop acutely, to have multiple causes and, except for a few cerebral diseases, to remit within a relatively short period of time of days to weeks, leaving the patient without residual damage.

The diagnosis is principally one of exclusion, requiring the absence of significant associated mood symptoms, any relevant medical condition, and substance abuse. Drug reactions that cause hallucinations, paranoia, confusion, or bizarre behavior may be dose-related or idiosyncratic; parkinsonian medications, clonidine, quinacrine, and procaine derivatives are the most common prescription medications associated with these symptoms. Drug causes should be ruled out in any case of newly emergent psychosis.

Thus the illness combines the features of schizophrenia and a confusional state.

Many common prescription drugs such as oral narcotics and benzodiazepines are often abused and readily available on the street. Alcohol abuse leading to high serum levels causes confusion, but more commonly, it is withdrawal from alcohol that leads to a hyperactive delirium. Alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal should be considered in all cases of delirium because even patients who drink only a few servings of alcohol every day can experience relatively severe withdrawal symptoms upon hospitalization."

            "content": "Side effects of the aforementioned class of drugs may include nausea and less often, vomiting. The families of our patients report from time to time that the medication caused insomnia or increased confusion. It is worth mentioning that when the acetylcholine receptor antagonist succinylcholine is used prior to general anesthesia, its effects may be prolonged in patients taking the above drugs. The use of trazodone, haloperidol, thioridazine, risperidone, and related drugs may suppress some of the aberrant behavior and hallucinations when these are problems, making life more comfortable for both patient and family, but several trials suggest that their general application causes more problems than it solves and they must often be discontinued in response to adverse effects. The randomized trial conducted by Schneider and coworkers found that olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone for the treatment of psychosis, aggression, or agitation with Alzheimer disease were approximately as"

            "content": "Birmes and associates. Drugs with dopaminergic activity used in the treatment of Parkinson disease are notorious for the induction of confusion or delirium, but it appears that the underlying disease provides an important substrate. Allied compounds with sympathomimetic actions such as cocaine and phencyclidine produce a hallucinatory delirium and yet others with different pharmacologic properties such as glutaminergic activity may result in a variety of delirious fragments or pure hallucinosis. Another entity that arises in this context is the neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a state associated with an agitated confusion followed by stupor. However, the characteristic features in neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) are progressive muscle rigidity and evidence of myonecrosis as indicated by elevations of the serum creatine kinase; usually there is in addition some elevation of body temperature. The clinical examination and a thorough history aid greatly in determining which category"

            "content": "In the instance of fever and confusion, particularly in the elderly person, the problem of \u201cseptic encephalopathy\u201d is offered as an explanation, but it may simply be a rephrasing of the well-known problem of infection such as pneumonia leading to a global confusion or delirium that was extensively discussed in the older literature by Osler. Young has called attention to the high frequency of this disorder in critically ill patients, 70 percent of their bacteremic patients, and its accompaniment by a polyneuropathy in a high proportion of cases. Paratonic rigidity of the limbs (an oppositional action on the patient\u2019s part that is proportioned to the effort of the examiner in moving the limbs) is an almost universal accompaniment; according to these authors, focal cerebral or cranial nerve signs are not encountered. All other potential causes of a confusional state must, of course, be excluded before attributing the state to an underlying infection."
