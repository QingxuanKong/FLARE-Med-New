We will examine each option given in the multiple-choice question and determine which one is true of both cancer cells and normal cells grown in culture.\\n\\nOption A: divide an indefinite number of times - This is not entirely true for normal cells grown in culture. Many normal cells have a limited number of times they can divide before they undergo replicative senescence, a process where they stop dividing. However, cancer cells can divide indefinitely in culture.\\n\\nOption B: do not display contact inhibition - This is true for cancer cells grown in culture. Normal cells grown in culture will typically stop dividing once they have reached confluence and will no longer divide even if provided with growth factors. Cancer cells, on the other hand, will continue to divide even after confluence.\\n\\nOption C: require a surface for attachment in order to grow - This is not true for cancer cells grown in culture. Normal cells grown in culture require a surface for attachment to grow, but cancer cells can grow in suspension and still divide.\\n\\nOption D: proliferate to the same cell density - This is not necessarily true for cancer cells grown in culture.

Most obviously, a mutation or epigenetic change can confer such an advantage by increasing the rate at which a clone of cells proliferates or by enabling it to continue proliferating when normal cells would stop. Cancer cells that can be grown in culture, or cultured cells artificially engineered to contain the types of mutations encountered in cancers, typically show a transformed phenotype. They are abnormal in their shape, their motility, their responses to growth factors in the culture medium, and, most characteristically, in the way they react to contact with the substratum and with one another. Normal cells will not divide unless they are attached to the substratum; transformed cells will often divide even if held in suspension. Normal cells become inhibited"

Many die, but typically much more by necrosis than by apoptosis (Figure 20\u201314). The tumor grows because the cell birth rate outpaces the cell death rate, but often by only a small margin. For this reason, the time that a tumor takes to double in size can be far longer than the cell-cycle time of the tumor cells. human Cancer Cells Escape a Built-in Limit to Cell Proliferation Many normal human cells have a built-in limit to the number of times they can divide when stimulated to proliferate in culture: they permanently stop dividing Figure 20\u201312 The Warburg effect in tumor cells reflects a dramatic change in glucose uptake and sugar metabolism."

For some cell types, including epithelial, endothelial, and muscle cells, even cell survival depends on such attachments. When these cells lose contact with the extracellular matrix, they undergo apoptosis. This dependence of cell growth, proliferation, and survival on attachment to a substratum is known as anchorage dependence, and it is mediated mainly by integrins and the intracellular signals they generate. Mutations that disrupt or override this form of control, allowing cells to escape from anchorage dependence, occur in cancer cells and play a major part in their invasive behavior."

These non-stem cells appear to constitute the great majority of the cell population in some tumors. The Cancer Stem-Cell Phenomenon Adds to the Difficulty of Curing Cancer Evidence for the cancer stem-cell phenomenon comes chiefly from experiments in which individual cells from a cancer are tested for their ability to give rise to fresh tumors: a standard assay is to implant the cells into an immunodeficient mouse (Figure 20\u201333).

For example, in several types of cancer, including breast cancers and leukemias, one can fractionate the tumor cells using monoclonal antibodies that recognize a particular cell-surface marker that is present on the normal stem cells in the tissue of origin of the cancer. The purified cancer cells expressing this marker are found to have a greatly enhanced ability to found new tumors.

For example, the cells of many cancers show grossly abnormal sets of chromosomes, with duplications, deletions, and translocations that are visible at mitosis (Figure 20\u201310). When the cells are maintained in culture, these patterns of chromosomal disruption can often be seen to evolve rapidly and in a seemingly haphazard way.

It is in these difficult steps that cells from highly metastatic tumors are observed to have much greater success than cells from a nonmetastatic source. It seems that the ability to escape from the parent tissue, and an ability to survive and grow in the foreign tissue, are key properties that cells must acquire to become metastatic.

(the outer epithelial layer of the skin), the lining of the digestive and reproductive tracts, and the bone marrow, where blood cells are generated (see Chapter 22). In almost all these tissues, renewal depends on the presence of stem cells, which divide"

            "content": "Different Searches for Oncogenes Converged on the Same Gene\u2014Ras In an attempt to answer the above question, other researchers searched directly for oncogenes in the genomes of human cancer cells. They did this by searching for DNA fragments from cancer cells that could provoke uncontrolled proliferation when introduced into noncancerous cell lines. As tester cells for the assay, cell lines derived from mouse fibroblasts were used. These cells had been previously selected for their ability to proliferate indefinitely in culture, and they are thought to already contain alterations that take them part of the way toward malignancy. For this reason, the addition of a single oncogene can sometimes be enough to produce a dramatic effect."

Experiments using mice indicate that the growth of some transplanted carcinomas depends on the tumor-associated fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts will not do. Such environmental requirements help to protect us from cancer, as we discuss next in considering the critical phenomenon called metastasis."

            "content": "Using slightly different culture conditions, with the right combination of growth factors in the medium, the neural stem cells can be grown as a monolayer and induced to proliferate as an almost pure stem-cell population without attendant differentiated progeny. By a further change in the culture conditions, these cells can be induced at any time to differentiate to give either a mixture of neurons and glial cells (Figure 22\u201339), or just one of these two cell types, according to the composition of the culture medium."
