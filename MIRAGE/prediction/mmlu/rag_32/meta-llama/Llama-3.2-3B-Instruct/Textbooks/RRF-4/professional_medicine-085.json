    "question": "A 54-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe jaw pain since undergoing a painful dental procedure 1 day ago. The patient was prescribed codeine after the procedure and instructed to take the medication every 4 hours, but she has continued pain despite adherence to this analgesic regimen. Other members of her family also have experienced poor pain control with codeine. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Decreased absorption of codeine",
        "B": "Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine",

        "D": "Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and answer: The patient is experiencing severe jaw pain despite taking codeine, which is a common opioid analgesic. To determine the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure, let's evaluate each option: A. Decreased absorption of codeine: While decreased absorption could lead to reduced efficacy, it's unlikely to be the primary cause of poor pain control in this scenario, as the patient is taking the medication as directed. B. Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine: Codeine is metabolized to morphine in the liver. If the metabolism is impaired, it could lead to reduced levels of morphine, the active metabolite, and thus decreased analgesic efficacy. This is a plausible explanation for the patient's poor pain control. C. Deficiency of \u03ba receptors: \u03ba receptors are involved in the analgesic effects of opioids, but a deficiency in these receptors would likely lead to decreased pain relief, not increased pain. D. Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine: Increased protein-binding would lead to reduced free (active) concentrations of codeine, which is unlikely to cause increased pain. Given the options, the most likely explanation for the patient's poor pain control is decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine, which would lead to reduced analgesic efficacy. Here is the answer in the requested format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing severe jaw pain despite taking codeine, which is a common opioid analgesic.

Determining the route of administration (oral, parenteral, neuraxial), duration of drug action, ceiling effect (maximal intrinsic activity), duration of therapy, potential for adverse effects, and the patient\u2019s past experience with opioids, including their genetics, social history, and family history, all should be addressed. One of the principal errors made by physicians in this setting is failure to match the severity of a patient\u2019s pain to his or her analgesic. Just as important is the principle that following delivery of the therapeutic plan, its effectiveness must be monitored and reevaluated and the plan modified if necessary."

In contrast, the metabolites of oxycodone and hydrocodone may be of minor consequence; the parent compounds are currently believed to be directly responsible for the majority of their analgesic actions. However, oxycodone and its metabolites can accumulate under conditions of renal failure and have been associated with prolonged action and sedation. In the case of codeine, conversion to morphine may be of greater importance because codeine itself has relatively low affinity for opioid receptors. As a result, some patients (so-called poor metabolizers) may experience no significant analgesic effect. In contrast, there have been case reports of an exaggerated response to codeine due to enhanced metabolic conversion to morphine (ie, ultra rapid metabolizers; see Chapters 4, 5) resulting in respiratory depression and death.

One approach is to reduce the medication dose by 10% every 1\u20132 weeks. Immediate cessation of analgesic use is possible for some patients, provided there is no contraindication. Both approaches are facilitated by the use of a medication diary maintained during the month or two before cessation; this helps to identify the scope of the problem. A small dose of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as naproxen, 500 mg bid, if tolerated, will help relieve residual pain as analgesic use is reduced. NSAID overuse is not usually a problem for patients with daily headache when a NSAID with a longer half-life is taken once or twice daily; however, overuse problems may develop with more frequent dosing schedules or shorter acting NSAIDS. Once the patient has substantially reduced analgesic use, a preventive medication should be introduced."

Therefore, if a patient is not experiencing pain relief or is experiencing too many side effects, a change to another opioid preparation is appropriate. When switching, one should begin with 50\u201375% of the published equianalgesic dose of the new opioid. Unlike NSAIDs, opioids have no ceiling effect; therefore, there is no maximum dose no matter how many milligrams the patient is receiving. The appropriate dose is the dose needed to achieve pain relief. This is an important point for clinicians to explain to patients and families.

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

Aching of the limbs may be related to their immobility, in which case they should be moved passively on frequent occasions. Aspirin or acetaminophen is usually sufficient to control hyperpathia and allodynia; occasionally codeine or methadone must be added. Obviously, opiates and addicting synthetic analgesics should be avoided if possible, but we have resorted to fentanyl patches for short periods in a few severely affected patients. Some of our patients with severe burning pain (similar to causalgia) in the feet had in the past been helped temporarily by blocking the lumbar sympathetic ganglia or by epidural injection of analgesics. The response to phenytoin, carbamazepine, and gabapentin has been inconsistent, but they are widely used. Adrenergic-blocking medication has been of little value and mexiletine, in our experience, of"

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"
