He received his third course of chemotherapy 4 weeks ago. Physical examination shows areflexia. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these adverse effects?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to consider the side effects of each chemotherapy drug listed and determine which one is most likely to cause the adverse effects described in the scenario. The patient has progressive numbness in his hands and feet, weakness in his legs when standing, and areflexia. These symptoms are indicative of peripheral neuropathy, which is a known side effect of certain chemotherapy drugs. Let's review the drugs listed and their side effect profiles:\\n\\nDoxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic that can cause cardiotoxicity, myelosuppression, and alopecia, but it is not commonly associated with peripheral neuropathy.\\n\\nFluorouracil is an antimetabolite that can cause myelosuppression, mucositis, and diarrhea, but it is not typically linked to peripheral neuropathy.\\n\\nMethotrexate is an antimetabolite that can cause myelosuppression, mucositis, and liver toxicity, but it is not commonly associated with peripheral neuropathy.\\n\\nVincristine is a vinca alkaloid that can cause neurotoxicity, including peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression, and alopecia. It is a well-known side effect of vincristine, especially at higher doses or with prolonged treatment.\\n\\nGiven the symptoms described, the most likely cause of the patient's adverse effects is vincristine, which is known to cause peripheral neuropathy.\\n\\nThe answer is D. Vincristine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Symptoms of neuropathy appeared between 3 and 35 weeks after treatment was begun and affected approximately 10 percent of patients receiving therapeutic doses in the upper range (10 mg/kg daily). The initial symptoms are symmetrical numbness and tingling of the toes and feet spreading, if the drug is continued, to the knees and occasionally to the hands. Aching and burning pain in these parts then becomes prominent. In addition to sensory loss, examination usually discloses a loss of tendon reflexes and weakness in the distal muscles of the legs. Severe degrees of weakness and loss of deep sensation are observed only rarely."

The highest risk for thiopurine-associated NHL is in patients over 65 years old, with a moderate risk in those between the ages of 50 and 65. Anti-TNF therapy increases the risk to approximately 6:10,000."

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

He saw his PCP for evaluation of low back pain. X-rays of the spine showed some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine plus several wedge deformities in the thoracic spine. The patient is a long-time smoker (up to two packs per day) and has two to four glasses of wine with dinner, more on the weekends. He has chronic bronchitis, presumably from smoking, and has been treated on numerous occasions with oral prednisone for exacerba-tions of bronchitis. He is currently on 10 mg/d prednisone.
