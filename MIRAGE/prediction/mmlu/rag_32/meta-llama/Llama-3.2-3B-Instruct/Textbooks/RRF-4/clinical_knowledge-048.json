As stated earlier, the circumstances during exercise are somewhat different. During a short period of intense exercise, the muscle uses carbohydrate derived from glycogen stores; myophosphorylase is the enzyme that initiates the metabolism of glycogen. With longer aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen stores, energy is provided by oxidation of fatty acids. Thus, muscle failure at a certain phase of exercise is predictive of the type of energy failure. A rising blood concentration of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate reflects the increasing oxidation of fatty acids, and an increase in blood lactate reflects the anaerobic metabolism of glucose. The cytochrome oxidative mechanisms are essential in both aerobic and anaerobic muscle"

In skeletal muscle, glycogenolysis occurs during active exercise, and glycogenesis begins as soon as the muscle is again at rest. Regulation of synthesis and degradation is accomplished on two levels. First, glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase are hormonally regulated (by covalent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation) to meet the needs of the body as a whole.

However, in the cardiac isozyme, the kinase domain is activated by epinephrine-mediated phosphorylation (see p. 100). Skeletal muscle is unique in being able to respond to substantial changes in the demand for ATP that accompanies contraction. At rest, muscle accounts for ~25% of the oxygen (O2) consumption of the body, whereas during vigorous exercise, it is responsible for up to 90%.

Glycogen is a highly branched polymer of \u03b1-D-glucose. The primary glycosidic bond is an \u03b1(1\u21924) linkage. After about 8\u201314 glucosyl residues, there is a branch containing an \u03b1(1\u21926) linkage. Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose, the building block of glycogen, is synthesized from glucose 1-phosphate and UTP by UDP\u2013glucose pyrophosphorylase (Fig. 11.14). Glucose from UDP-glucose is transferred to the nonreducing ends of glycogen chains by primer-requiring glycogen synthase, which makes the \u03b1(1\u21924) linkages. The primer is made by glycogenin. Branches are formed by amylo-\u03b1(1\u21924)\u2192\u03b1(1\u21926)-transglycosylase (a 4:6 transferase), which transfers a set of six to eight glucosyl residues from the nonreducing end of the"

            "content": "diagnosis Lack of an increase in blood lactate and exaggerated blood ammonia elevations after an ischemic exercise test are indicative of a muscle glycogenosis and suggest a defect in the conversion of glycogen or glucose to lactate. This abnormal exercise response, however, can also occur with other defects in glycogenolysis or glycolysis, such as deficiencies of muscle phosphofructokinase or debranching enzyme (when the test is done after fasting). The cycle test detects the hallmark heart rate observed during the second-wind phenomenon. A definitive diagnosis is made by enzymatic assay in muscle tissue or by mutation analysis of the myophosphorylase gene."

Interestingly, although glucocorti-coid infusion alone does not increase glucose levels, it does pro-long and augment the hyperglycemic effects of catecholamines and glucagon when glucocorticoid is administered concurrently with the latter.Glycogen stores within skeletal muscles can be mobilized by epinephrine activation of b-adrenergic receptors, GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins), which subsequently activates the second messenger, cAMP. The cAMP activates phosphorylase kinase, which in turn leads to conversion of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate. Phosphorylase kinase also can be activated by the second messenger, calcium, through the breakdown of phos-phatidylinositol phosphate, which is the case in vasopressin-mediated hepatic glycogenolysis.243Protein and Amino Acid MetabolismThe average protein intake in healthy young adults ranges from 80 to 120 g/d, and every 6 g of protein yields"
