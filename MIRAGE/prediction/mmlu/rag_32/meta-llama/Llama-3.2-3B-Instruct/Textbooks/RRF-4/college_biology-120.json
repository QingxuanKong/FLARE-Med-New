The question mentions a subunit of DNA and protein consisting of 134-base-pair long stretches of DNA surrounding a protein octamer.

The documents do not explicitly describe histones as consisting of DNA stretches.\\n\\nOption B: Chromatin - Chromatin is the complex of DNA and proteins that makes up the chromosome, but it is not a specific subunit consisting of DNA stretches and a protein octamer.\\n\\nOption C: Nucleosome - The nucleosome is a subunit of chromatin consisting of a core of eight histone proteins around which the DNA is wrapped in a left-handed coil. The documents mention that nucleosomes consist of 134-base-pair long stretches of DNA surrounding a protein octamer, which matches the description given in the question.\\n\\nOption D: Solenoid - A solenoid is a type of coil, but it is not a term used to describe a subunit of DNA and protein consisting of DNA stretches and a protein octamer.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is Option C: Nucleosome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Nucleosomes are found in both euchromatin and heterochromatin and in chromosomes. These 10-nm-diameter particles represent the first level of chromatin folding and are formed by the coiling of the DNA molecule around a protein core. This step shortens the DNA molecule by approximately sevenfold relative to the unfolded DNA molecule. The core of the nucleosome consists of eight histone molecules (called an octamer). Two loops of DNA (approximately 146 nucleotide pairs) are wrapped around the core octomer. The DNA extends between each particle as a 2-nm filament that joins adjacent nucleosomes. When chromatin is extracted from the nucleus, the nucleosomal substructure of chromatin is visible in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and is often described as \u201cbeads on a string\u201d (Fig. 3.2a)."

(The term nucleosome technically refers to a nucleosome core particle plus one of its adjacent DNA linkers, but it is often used synonymously with nucleosome core particle.) On average, therefore, nucleosomes repeat at intervals of about 200 nucleotide pairs. For example, a diploid human cell with 6.4 \u00d7 109 nucleotide pairs contains approximately 30 million nucleosomes.

To do so requires the interaction of DNA with a large number of proteins, each of which performs a specific function in the ordered packaging of these long molecules of DNA. Eukaryotic DNA is associated with tightly bound basic proteins, called histones. These serve to order the DNA into fundamental structural units, called nucleosomes, which resemble beads on a string.

            "content": "The Structure of the Nucleosome Core Particle Reveals How DNA Is Packaged The high-resolution structure of a nucleosome core particle, solved in 1997, revealed a disc-shaped histone core around which the DNA was tightly wrapped in a left-handed coil of 1.7 turns (Figure 4\u201323). All four of the histones that make up the core of the nucleosome are relatively small proteins (102\u2013135 amino acids), and they share a structural motif, known as the histone fold, formed from three \u03b1 helices connected by two loops (Figure 4\u201324). In assembling a nucleosome, the histone folds first bind to each other to form H3\u2013H4 and H2A\u2013H2B dimers, and the H3\u2013H4 dimers combine to form tetramers. An H3\u2013H4 tetramer then further combines with two H2A\u2013H2B dimers to form the compact octamer core, around which the DNA is wound."

(A) DNA polymerase catalyzes the stepwise addition of a deoxyribonucleotide to the 3\u02b9-OH end of a polynucleotide chain, the growing primer strand that is paired to an existing template strand. The newly synthesized DNA strand therefore polymerizes in the 5\u02b9-to-3\u02b9 direction as shown also in the previous figure. Because each incoming deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate must pair with the template strand to be recognized by the DNA polymerase, this strand determines which of the four possible deoxyribonucleotides (A, C, G, or T) will be added. The reaction is driven by a large, favorable free-energy change, caused by the release of pyrophosphate and its subsequent hydrolysis to two molecules of inorganic phosphate. (B) Structure of DNA polymerase complexed wth DNA (orange), as determined by x-ray crystallography (Movie 5.1). The template DNA strand is the longer strand and the newly synthesized DNA is the shorter. (C) Schematic diagram"

Complementary strand separation In order for the two complementary strands of the parental dsDNA to be replicated, they must first separate (or \u201cmelt\u201d) over a small region, because the polymerases use only ssDNA as a template. In prokaryotic organisms, DNA replication begins at a single, unique nucleotide sequence, a site called the origin of replication, or ori (oriC in E. coli), as shown in Figure 30.9A. [Note: This sequence is referred to as a consensus sequence, because the order of nucleotides is essentially the same at each site.] The ori includes short, AT-rich segments that facilitate melting. In eukaryotes, replication begins at multiple sites along the DNA helix (Fig. 30.9B). Having multiple origins of replication provides a mechanism for rapidly replicating the great length of eukaryotic DNA molecules. B. Replication fork formation"

These proteins are unable to open a long DNA helix directly, but they aid helicases by stabilizing the unwound, single-strand conformation. In addition, through cooperative binding, they coat and straighten out the regions of single-strand DNA, which occur routinely in the lagging-strand template, thereby preventing the formation of the short hairpin helices that readily form in single-strand DNA (Figure 5\u201315 and Figure 5\u201316). If not removed, these hairpin helices can impede the DNA synthesis catalyzed by DNA polymerase. A Sliding Ring Holds a Moving DNA Polymerase Onto the DNA"

            "content": "The minimal DNA sequence required for directing DNA replication initiation in S. cerevisiae has been determined by taking a segment of DNA that spans an origin of replication and testing smaller and smaller DNA fragments for their ability to function as origins. Most DNA sequences that can serve as an origin of replication are found to contain (1) a binding site for a large, multisubunit initiator protein called ORC, for origin recognition complex; (2) a stretch of DNA that is rich in As and Ts and therefore easy to melt; and (3) at least one binding site for proteins that facilitate ORC binding, probably by adjusting chromatin structure."

Binding causes an AT-rich region (the DNA unwinding element) in the origin to melt. Melting (strand separation) results in a short, localized region of ssDNA. b. DNA helicases: These enzymes bind to ssDNA near the replication fork and then move into the neighboring double-stranded region, forcing the strands apart (in effect, unwinding the double helix). Helicases require energy provided by ATP hydrolysis (see Fig. 30.10). Unwinding at the replication fork causes supercoiling in other regions of the DNA molecule. [Note: DnaB is the principal helicase of replication in E. coli. Binding of this hexameric protein to DNA requires DnaC.] c."
