    "question": "A 5-year-old boy returns to the office with his 19-year-old mother to discuss results of studies done to evaluate his behavior of eating dirt. The patient sits quietly while his mother answers questions about his health. She says her son seems healthy, although he does not seem to be as active as other children his age. He has said his head hurts three or four times during the past 2 weeks. He has not had fever, sweats, or chills. She says he has a good appetite but has had a habit of eating sand and dirt since age 3 years. She says, \"I don't know where he gets that habit. I used to eat dirt, but I stopped years ago. I try to stop him from eating dirt, but I'm not around much since I work two jobs.\" The patient takes no medications. Vaccinations are upto-date. Height, weight, and BMI are at the 50th percentile. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities except for symmetrical nontender cervical adenopathy. Results of laboratory studies, including serum zinc, lead, and iron concentrations, are within the reference ranges. Serologic testing confirms toxoplasmosis.

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate next step in management, let's analyze the given information: The patient is a 5-year-old boy with a history of eating dirt since age 3, symmetrical nontender cervical adenopathy, and confirmed toxoplasmosis through serologic testing. The patient's laboratory studies, including serum zinc, lead, and iron concentrations, are within the reference ranges. The patient is taking no medications and has no other medical history. The primary concern is the patient's behavior of eating dirt, which is a common symptom of Pica disorder. The presence of toxoplasmosis is a significant finding, as it can be transmitted through contaminated food or water, and Pica disorder can increase the risk of toxoplasmosis infection. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to refer the patient to a child psychiatrist for further evaluation and treatment of the Pica disorder. The other options, such as prescribing medications like fluoxetine, methylphenidate, or risperidone, may not address the underlying issue of Pica disorder, and may even potentially worsen the situation. Prescribing fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is typically used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but it is not indicated for Pica disorder. Methylphenidate is also used to treat ADHD, and risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Referring the patient to a child psychiatrist will allow for a comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan to address the Pica disorder and any underlying psychological or emotional issues that may be contributing to the behavior.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient.

The medical history should reveal the setting in which lymphadenopathy is occurring. Symptoms such as sore throat, cough, fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, or pain in the nodes should be sought. The patient\u2019s age, sex, occupation, exposure to pets, sexual behavior, and use of drugs such as diphenylhydantoin are other important historic points. For example, children and young adults usually have benign (i.e., nonmalignant) disorders that account for the observed lymphadenopathy such as viral or bacterial upper respiratory infections; infectious mononucleosis; toxoplasmosis; and, in some countries, tuberculosis. In contrast, after age 50, the incidence of malignant disorders increases and that of benign disorders decreases."

These episodes now occur almost nightly and are interfering with her ability to teach. She has tried various over-the-counter sleep remedies, but they were of little help and she experienced \u201changover\u201d effects on the day following their use. Her general health is good, she is"

He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen"

Simple screening tests are recommended to identify common illnesses that cause growth failureand to search for medical problems resulting from malnutrition. Initial tests may include a complete blood count; screening for iron deficiency anemia and lead toxicity; urinalysis,urine culture, and serum electrolytes to assess renal infection ordysfunction; thyroid stimulating hormone; liver function tests;and a protein purified derivative test to screen for tuberculosis.Human immunodeficiency virus testing may also be indicated.For children with diarrhea, abdominal pain, or malodorousstools, a stool sample for culture and ova and parasites may be indicated.

It must be pointed out, however, that these accomplishments were essentially continuations of lines of endeavor that had been initiated in early adult life. Indeed, from general observation it can be concluded that little that is truly new and original to the individual is started after the 50th year. High intelligence, well-organized work habits, and sound judgment compensate for many of the progressive shortcomings of old age. Personality Changes in the Aged"

A prominentlymph node that does not resolve (with or without antibiotics)may warrant a biopsy. A limp that does not improve within weeksshould prompt a CBC and a radiograph or a bone scan. Persistent headaches or morning vomiting should prompt a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)scan of the head.

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"
