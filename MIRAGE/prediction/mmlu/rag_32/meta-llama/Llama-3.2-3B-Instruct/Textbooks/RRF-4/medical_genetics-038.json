Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome are all known to be familial cancer syndromes. FAP is associated with mutations in the APC gene, Li-Fraumeni syndrome is associated with mutations in the TP53 gene, and Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is associated with mutations in the VHL gene. Waardenburg syndrome, on the other hand, is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the ears, eyes, and other parts of the body, but it is not primarily known as a familial cancer syndrome. It is associated with mutations in the PAX3 or EDN3 genes, which affect pigmentation and hearing, but it does not have a direct link to cancer predisposition like the other options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Patients with this syndrome develop hundreds to thousands of adenomas in the colon. Each of these adenomas has lost the normal remaining allele of APC but has not yet accumulated the required additional mutations to generate fully malignant cells (Fig. 101e-2). The loss of the second functional APC allele in tumors from FAP families often occurs through loss of heterozygosity. However, out of these thousands of benign adenomas, several will invariably acquire further abnormalities and a subset will even develop into fully malignant cancers.

Not more than 10% of human breast cancers can be linked directly to germline mutations. Several genes have been implicated in familial cases. The Li-Fraumeni syndrome is characterized by inherited mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene, which lead to an increased incidence of breast cancer, osteogenic sarcomas, and other malignancies.

Presented next is a discussion of the varied genetic lesions that underlie altered cancer gene expression and function. The genetic changes found in cancers vary from point mutations involving single nucleotides to abnormalities large enough to produce gross changes in chromosome structure. In certain neoplasms, genetic abnormalities are nonrandom and highly characteristic. Specific chromosomal abnormalities have been identified in most leukemias and lymphomas and in an increasing number of nonhematopoietic tumors, while other tumors are characterized by particular point mutations. It is believed that all recurrent genetic changes alter the activity of one or more cancer genes in a fashion that gives the affected cells a selective advantage, presumably by contributing to one or more of the hallmarks of cancer."

            "content": "Hereditary ovarian cancers occur in women approximately 10 years younger than those with nonhereditary tumors (i.e., closer to age 50 compared to age 60 for those with sporadic cancer) (59). A woman with a first-or second-degree relative who had premenopausal ovarian cancer may have a higher probability of carrying an affected gene. Breast and ovarian cancer may exist in a family in which there is a combination of epithelial ovarian and breast cancers, affecting a mixture of first-and second-degree relatives. Women with this syndrome tend to have these tumors at a young age, and the breast cancers may be bilateral. If two first-degree relatives are affected, this pedigree is consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance (50,58). Most BRCA1 ovarian cancers are high-grade serous carcinomas (Fig. 37.9)."

            "content": "Many diseases have multiple patterns of inheritance, adding to the complexity of evaluating patients and families for these conditions. For example, colon cancer can be associated with a single germline mutation in a mismatch repair gene (Lynch syndrome, autosomal dominant), biallelic mutations in MYH (autosomal recessive), or multiple SNPs (polygenic). Many more individuals will have SNP risk alleles than germline mutations in high-penetrance genes, but cumulative lifetime risk of colon cancer related to the former is modest, whereas the risk related to the latter is significant. Personal and family histories provide important insights into the possible mode of inheritance."

            "content": "http://ebooksmedicine.net A large number of risk factors for breast cancer have been identified ( Table 19.6 ). Some of the more important risk factors are summarized next. Age and Gender. Breast cancer is rare in women younger than age 25, but increases in incidence rapidly after age 30 ( Fig. 19.26 ); 75% of women with breast cancer are older than 50 years of age, and only 5% are younger than 40. The incidence in men is only 1% of that in women. Family History of Breast Cancer. The greatest risk is for individuals with multiple affected first-degree relatives with early-onset breast cancer. In most families, it is thought that various combinations of low penetrance, \u201cweak\u201d cancer genes are responsible for increased risk. However, approximately 5% to 10% of breast cancers occur in persons who inherit highly penetrant germline mutations in tumor suppressor genes (discussed later). For these individuals, the lifetime risk of breast cancer may be greater than 90%."

            "content": "Medullary carcinomas of the thyroid are neuroendocrine tumors derived from the parafollicular cells, or C cells, of the thyroid. Like normal C cells, medullary carcinomas secrete calcitonin, measurement of which plays an important role in the diagnosis and postoperative follow-up of patients. In some cases, the tumor cells elaborate other polypeptide hormones such as somatostatin, serotonin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide. Medullary carcinomas arise sporadically in about 70% of cases. The remaining 30% are familial, occurring in the setting of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome 2A or 2B, or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma without an associated MEN syndrome, as discussed later. Both familial and sporadic medullary forms are associated with gain-of-function driver mutations in the RET receptor tyrosine kinase. Sporadic medullary carcinomas, as well as familial cases without an associated MEN syndrome, occur in adults, with a peak incidence in the fifth and sixth"
