Adenoviruses have been explored for their potential in gene therapy due to their ability to infect a wide range of cell types and express high levels of the transgene. However, they also have some limitations. Let's evaluate each option in light of this knowledge.\\n\\nOption A: long term expression. Adenoviruses can indeed provide long-term expression of the transgene, but this is not a unique advantage in gene therapy. Other vectors like AAV can also provide long-term expression.\\n\\nOption B: low risk of insertional mutagenesis. This is a significant advantage of adenoviruses. Adenoviruses are replication-defective, which reduces the risk of insertional mutagenesis. This is a major concern in gene therapy, as insertional mutagenesis can lead to cancer.\\n\\nOption C: low immunogenicity. Adenoviruses can elicit a strong immune response, which can lead to immunogenicity and limit the duration of expression. This is not a characteristic of adenoviruses.\\n\\nOption D: easy assembly. Adenoviruses are not necessarily easy to assemble, especially when compared to other vectors like AAV. The assembly process can be complex and requires careful optimization.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B. low risk of insertional mutagenesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Response rates (~15%) are comparable to those of other single agents. The use of oncolytic viruses that selectively replicate in tumor cells but not in normal cells has also shown promise in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and in other solid tumors. This approach is based on the observation that deletion of certain viral genes abolishes their ability to replicate in normal cells but not in tumor cells. An advantage of this strategy is that the replicating vector can proliferate and spread within the tumor, facilitating eventual tumor clearance.

Because delivery of naked DNA or RNA to a cell is an inefficient process, most gene transfer is carried out using a vector, or gene delivery vehicle. These vehicles have generally been engineered from viruses by deleting some or all of the viral genome and replacing it with the therapeutic gene of interest under the control of a suitable promoter (Table 91e-1). Gene transfer strategies can thus be described in terms of three essential elements: (1) a vector; (2) a gene to be delivered, sometimes called the transgene; and (3) a physiologically relevant target cell to which the DNA or RNA is delivered. The series of steps in which the vector and donated DNA enter the target cell and express the transgene is referred to as transduction.

This approach makes use of novel reagents including zinc finger nucleases, TALENs and CRISPR, which introduce double-stranded breaks into the DNA near the site of the mutation and then rely on a donated repair sequence and cellular mechanisms for repair of double-strand breaks to reconstitute a functioning gene. Another strategy recently introduced into clinical trials is the use of siRNAs or short hairpin RNAs as transgenes to knock down expression of deleterious genes (e.g., mutant huntingtin in Huntington\u2019s disease or genes of the hepatitis C genome in infected individuals)."

An ideal vector would be administered through a noninvasive route and would transduce all of the cancer cells and none of the normal cells. Furthermore, the ideal vector would have a high degree of activity, that is, it would produce an adequate amount of the desired gene product to achieve target cell kill. Unlike genetic diseases in which delivery of the gene of interest into only a portion of the cells may be sufficient to achieve clinical effect, cancer"

A central question to 91e-5 be addressed is the long-term safety of gene transfer, and regulatory agencies have mandated a 15-year follow-up for subjects enrolled in gene therapy trials (Table 91e-4). Realization of the therapeutic benefits of modern molecular medicine will depend on continued progress in gene transfer technology."

Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, caused most frequently by types 8, 19, and 37, has been associated with contaminated common sources such as ophthalmic solutions and roller towels. Adenoviruses have also been implicated in disseminated disease and pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients, including recipients of SOTs or HSCTs. In HSCT recipients, adenovirus infections have manifested as pneumonia, hepatitis, nephritis, colitis, encephalitis, and hemorrhagic cystitis. In SOT recipients, adenovirus infection may involve the organ transplanted (e.g., hepatitis in liver transplants, nephritis in renal transplants) but can disseminate to other organs as well. In patients with AIDS, high-numbered and intermediate adenovirus serotypes have been isolated, usually in the setting of low"

Gene delivery can take place in vivo, in which the vector is directly injected into the patient, or, in the case of hematopoietic and some other target cells, ex vivo, with removal of the target cells from the patient, followed by return of the gene-modified autologous cells to the patient after manipulation in the laboratory. The latter approach effectively combines gene transfer techniques with cellular therapies (Chap. 90e)."
