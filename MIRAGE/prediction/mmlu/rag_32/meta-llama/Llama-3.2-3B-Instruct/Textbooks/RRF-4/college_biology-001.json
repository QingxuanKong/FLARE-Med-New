    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's first define what a frameshift mutation is. A frameshift mutation is a type of mutation that occurs when one or two nucleotides are either deleted from or added to the coding region of an mRNA, altering the reading frame. This can result in a product with a radically different amino acid sequence or a truncated product due to the eventual creation of a termination codon. Now, let's examine each option in light of this definition.\\n\\nOption A: Telomeric sequences are the repetitive nucleotide sequences at the ends of chromosomes, and removing them does not directly affect the reading frame of a gene. Therefore, this option is not a frameshift mutation.\\n\\nOption B: A codon's nucleotide sequence changing to code for a different amino acid is a point mutation, not a frameshift mutation. While this can alter the amino acid sequence, it does not alter the reading frame.\\n\\nOption C: The insertion or deletion of a base pair can indeed alter the reading frame, as it changes the number of nucleotides in the coding sequence. This matches the definition of a frameshift mutation.\\n\\nOption D: A codon's nucleotide sequence changing to code for a termination codon is a nonsense mutation, which can also result in a truncated protein. However, this is not a frameshift mutation, as the reading frame remains intact.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, as it directly alters the reading frame by changing the number of nucleotides in the coding sequence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

This can result in a product with a radically different amino acid sequence or a truncated product due to the eventual creation of a termination codon (Fig. 32.5). If three nucleotides are added, a new amino acid is added to the peptide. If three are deleted, an amino acid is lost. Loss of three nucleotides maintains the reading frame but can result in serious pathology. For example, cystic fibrosis (CF), a chronic, progressive, inherited disease that primarily affects the pulmonary and digestive systems, is most commonly caused by deletion of three nucleotides from the coding region of a gene, resulting in the loss of phenylalanine (Phe, or F; see p. 5) at the 508th position (\u2206F508) in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein encoded by that gene.

Targeting of proteins destined to function as components of the plasma membrane is an example of cotranslational targeting. It involves the initiation of translation on cytosolic ribosomes; recognition of the amino (N)terminal signal sequence in the protein by the signal recognition particle; movement of the protein-synthesizing complex to the outer face of the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); and continuation of protein synthesis, such that the protein is threaded into the lumen of the ER and packaged into vesicles that travel to and through the Golgi and eventually fuse with the plasma membrane.

Instead, the mutation typically creates a new pattern of splicing (Figure 6\u201333). Most commonly, an exon is simply skipped (Figure 6\u201333B). In other cases, the mutation causes a cryptic splice junction to be efficiently used (Figure 6\u201333C). Apparently, the splicing machinery has evolved to pick out the best possible pattern of splice junctions, and if the optimal one is damaged by mutation, it will seek out the next best pattern, and so on. This inherent plasticity in the process of RNA splicing suggests that changes in splicing patterns caused by random mutations have been important in the evolution of genes and organisms. It also means that mutations that affect splicing can be severely detrimental to the organism: in addition to the \u03b2 thalassemia, example presented in Figure 6\u201333, aberrant"

Inactivating mutations are usually recessive, and an affected individual is homozygous or compound heterozygous (e.g., carrying two different mutant alleles of the same gene) for the disease-causing mutations. Alternatively, mutation in a single allele can result in haploinsufficiency, a situation in which one normal allele is not sufficient to maintain a normal phenotype. Haploinsufficiency is a commonly observed mechanism in diseases associated with mutations in transcription factors (Table 82-2).

Frameshift mutations during class switch recombination do not occur because switch regions lie in introns. D. The error-prone MSH2/6 polymerase repairs DNA lesions and causes mutations that promote somatic hypermutation. 10.11Fill-in-the-Blanks: Fc receptors diversify the effector functions of the distinct antibody isotypes. Most Fc receptors can bind the Fc regions of antibodies with _________ affinity. In contrast, Fc\u03b5RI binds with ________ affinity. Multivalent antigen-bound IgE can bind _________ in mast cells and cause release of lipid mediators such as _________ and _________. Mast cells also degranulate in response to cross-linking of the FC receptor-bound IgE, which causes release of __________, and as a consequence local blood flow and __________ are increased, initiating an inflammatory response.

            "content": "Evidence for the importance of CCR5 in transmission of HIV infection has come from studies of individuals with a high risk of exposure to HIV1 who remain seronegative. Lymphocytes and macrophages from these people are resistant to HIV infection in cultures inoculated with HIV. The resistance of these individuals to HIV infection is explained by discovery that they are homozygous for a nonfunctional variant of CCR5 called \u039432, caused by a 32basepair deletion from the coding region that leads to a frameshift mutation and a truncated protein. The frequency of this mutant allele in Caucasians is high at 0.09 (that is, about 10% of the population are heterozygous carriers of the allele and about 1% are homozygous). The mutant allele has not been found in Japanese or in black Africans from Western or Central Africa. Whether heterozygous deficiency of CCR5 provides some protection against infection by HIV is controversial, but it appears to contribute to a modest, if any, reduction in"

Genetic testing for CF may involve the use of a set of probes for the most common mutations, a technique known as restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. D. Some mutations result in premature degradation of the CFTR protein through tagging with ubiquinone followed by proteasome-mediated proteolysis. E. The most common mutation, \u2206F508, results in the loss of a codon for phenylalanine (F) and is classified as a frameshift mutation. Q2. The CFTR protein is an intrinsic plasma membrane glycoprotein. Targeting of proteins destined to function as components of membranes: A. includes transport to and through the Golgi. B. involves an amino-terminal signal sequence that is retained in the functional protein. C. occurs after the protein has been completely synthesized (that is, posttranslationally)."

            "content": "If a DNA-damaging chemical was used to generate the mutations, identifying the inactivated gene is often more laborious, but there are several powerful strategies available. If the genome size of the organism is small (for example, for bacteria or simple eukaryotes), it is possible to simply determine the genome sequence of the mutant organism and identify the affected gene by comparison with the wild-type sequence. Because of the continuous accumulation of neutral mutations, there will probably be differences between the two genome sequences in addition to the mutation responsible for the phenotype. One way of proving that a mutation is causative is to introduce the putative mutation back into a normal organism and determine whether or not it causes the mutant phenotype. We will discuss how this is accomplished later in the chapter."
