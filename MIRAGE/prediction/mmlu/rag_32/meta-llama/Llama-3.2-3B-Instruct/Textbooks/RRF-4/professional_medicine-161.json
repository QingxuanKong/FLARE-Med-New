JDM follows one of three clinical courses: a monophasic course, in which patients are treated and improve without significant sequelae; a chronic recurrent course; and a chronic progressive course marked by poor response to therapy and resulting loss of function. Patients who ultimately develop calcinosis are at risk for chronic loss of mobility, depending on the extent of calcium deposition. The association of dermatomyositis with malignancy seen in adults does not occur in children. Growing pains, or benign musculoskeletal pain syndrome, occur in 10% to 20% of school-age children. The peak age range is 3 to 7 years; the syndrome seems to be more common in boys than girls. There is no known etiology, although there seems to be a familial predisposition."

Acupuncture is one of the best-studied CAM modalities, but more studies of higher quality are needed regarding its application to the menopausal patient. The existing studies on acupuncture and menopausal symptoms are mixed. In a systematic review, which included 11 trials and 763 women, concluded that while some studies showed greater benefit with acupuncture than hormone therapy for reducing vasomotor symptoms, many showed no benefit (92). Another systematic review drew the same conclusions (93). In a randomized controlled trial of 267 women comparing individualized acupuncture plus self-care to self-care alone, both the frequency and the intensity of hot \ufb02ashes significantly decreased in the"
