The Golgi apparatus is a complex organelle that consists of a series of flattened cisternae stacked on top of each other. The cisternae are arranged in a specific order, with the cis face facing the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the trans face facing the Golgi network (GN) and the plasma membrane. The cisternae are connected by tubular connections that allow for the movement of proteins and lipids between them. The Golgi apparatus is responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids for secretion or use within the cell. Glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs in the Golgi apparatus, but it is not specified whether it occurs prior to or after the protein's entry into its lumen. The correct answer can be determined by considering the orientation of the Golgi apparatus and its relationship with other organelles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

It consists of a collection of flattened, membrane-enclosed compartments called cisternae, that somewhat resemble a stack of pita breads. Each Golgi stack typically consists of four to six cisternae (Figure 13\u201326), although some unicellular flagellates can have more than 20. In animal cells, tubular connections between corresponding cisternae link many stacks, thus forming a single complex, which is usually located near the cell nucleus and close to the centrosome (Figure 13\u201327A). This localization depends on microtubules. If microtubules are experimentally depolymerized, the Golgi apparatus reorganizes into individual stacks that are found throughout the cytoplasm, adjacent to ER exit sites. Some cells, including most plant cells, have hundreds of individual Golgi stacks dispersed throughout the cytoplasm where they are typically"

Organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts are usually present in large enough numbers to be safely inherited if, on average, their numbers roughly double once each cycle. The ER in interphase cells is continuous with the nuclear membrane and is organized by the microtubule cytoskeleton. Upon entry into M phase, the reorganization of the microtubules and breakdown of the nuclear envelope releases the ER. In most cells, the ER remains largely intact and is cut in two during cytokinesis. The Golgi apparatus is reorganized and fragmented during mitosis. Golgi fragments associate with the spindle poles and are thereby distributed to opposite ends of the spindle, ensuring that each daughter cell inherits the materials needed to reconstruct the Golgi in telophase. some Cells Reposition Their spindle to divide asymmetrically"

Formylated methionyl-transfer (t)RNA C. Movement of the messenger RNA out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm D. Recognition of the 5\u2032-cap by initiation factors E. Translocation of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A site to the P site Correct answer = E. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, continued translation (elongation) requires movement of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A to the P site to allow the next aminoacyl-tRNA to enter the A site. Only prokaryotes have a Shine-Dalgarno sequence and use formylated methionine and only eukaryotes have a nucleus and co-and posttranscriptionally process their mRNA."

This transmission electron micrograph shows a quick-frozen isolated Golgi apparatus replica from a cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. The trans-Golgi cisternae are in the process of coated vesicle formation. b. Incubation of the trans-Golgi cisternae with the coatomer-depleted cytosol shows a decrease in vesicle formation activity. Note the lack of vesicles and the fenestrated shape of the trans-Golgi cisternae. 85,000. (Courtesy of Dr. John E. Heuser, Washington University School of Medicine.)"

Many of the vesicle-like structures seen in the micrograph are cross sections of tubules that extend above and below the plane of this thin section and are interconnected. (b) vesicular tubular clusters move along microtubules to carry proteins from the ER er to the golgi apparatus. copI-coated vesicles mediate the budding of vesicles that return to the (A) 0.2 \u00b5m er from these clusters (and from the golgi apparatus). (a, courtesy of william balch.) the electron microscope (Figure 13\u201324A). These clusters constitute a compartment that is separate from the ER and lacks many of the proteins that function in the ER. They are generated continually and function as transport containers that bring material from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. The clusters move quickly along microtubules to the Golgi apparatus with which they fuse (Figure 13\u201324B and Movie 13.2)."
