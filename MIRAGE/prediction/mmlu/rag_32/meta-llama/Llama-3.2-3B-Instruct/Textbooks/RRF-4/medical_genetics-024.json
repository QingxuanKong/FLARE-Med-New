According to Document [0], Down syndrome is caused by a translocation involving chromosome 21, which can be balanced (as in the mother) or unbalanced (in the child).

Let's examine the options: \\n\\n Option A: 46,XX,der(14;21)(q10;q10)pat+21 - This karyotype indicates a balanced translocation involving chromosomes 14 and 21, but the child has an extra copy of chromosome 21 material due to the unbalanced translocation. This is diagnostic of Down syndrome.\\n\\n Option B: 47,XY,+13 - This karyotype indicates trisomy 13, not Down syndrome. \\n\\n Option C: 45,XX,rob,(14;21)(q10;q10) - This karyotype indicates a balanced translocation involving chromosomes 14 and 21, but the child has lost some material from chromosome 21 due to the unbalanced translocation.

The translocation form of Down syndrome (described later) exhibits an uncommon but important exception to this principle. Some specific examples of diseases involving changes in the karyotype are presented next. Three autosomal trisomies (21, 18, and 13) and one deletion syndrome (cri du chat syndrome), which results from partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5, were the first chromosomal abnormalities identified. More recently, several additional trisomies and deletion syndromes (such as those affecting 22q) have been described.

Studies of humans with partial trisomy of chromosome 21 and mouse models of trisomy have identified the critical region of human chromosome 21 that is involved in the pathogenesis. Based on these studies, several gene clusters, each of which is predicted to participate in the same biologic pathway, have been implicated. For example, 16 genes are involved in the mitochondrial energy pathway, several are likely to influence CNS development, and one group is involved in folate metabolism.

What followed, by the use of linkage analysis and other genetic techniques, was the elucidation of single gene mutations that were obligatorily associated with malformations or developmental delays; most of the inherited metabolic disorders of infancy and childhood discussed in Chap. 36 are of this type but also certain gross malformations of the brain such as lissencephaly, discussed further on."

Jacobs and Lejeune in 1959 almost simultaneously were the first to note a triplication of the 21st chromosome in Down syndrome, and there followed the discovery of a number of other trisomies as well as deletions or translocations of other autosomal chromosomes and a lack or excess of one of the sex chromosomes. Such an event must take place sometime after the formation of the oocyte, during the long period when it lies fallow in the ovary or during the process of conception or germination and first cell divisions.

Karyotype analysis has a diagnostic accuracy of more than 99 percent for aneuploidy and chromosomal abnormalities larger than 5 to 10 megabases. In the setting of a fetal structural abnormality, chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) is recommended as the first-line genetic test performed, as it may detect clinically significant chromosomal abnormalities in approximately 6 percent of fetuses with normal standard karyotype (Callaway, 2013; de Wit, 2014). An exception would be if the structural abnormality strongly suggests a particular karyotype-such as endocardial cushion defect with trisomy 21 or holoprosencephaly with trisomy 13. In such cases, karyotyping with or without luorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) may be ofered as the initial test"

            "content": "Described briefly next are two disorders, Klinefelter syndrome and Turner syndrome, that result from aberrations of sex chromosomes. Klinefelter syndrome is defined as male hypogonadism that develops when there are at least two X chromosomes and one or more Y chromosomes. It is the most common cause of hypogonadism in males. Most affected patients have a 47,XXY karyotype. This karyotype results from non-disjunction of sex chromosomes during meiosis. The extra X chromosome may be of either maternal or paternal origin. Advanced maternal age and a history of irradiation in either parent may contribute to the meiotic error resulting in this condition. Approximately 15% of the patients show mosaic patterns, including 46,XY/47,XXY, 47,XXY/48,XXXY, and variations on this theme. The presence of a 46,XY line in mosaics usually is associated with a milder clinical condition."

Approximately 5% to 10% of the total cell free DNA in maternal blood is derived from the fetus and can be identified by polymorphic genetic markers. By using next-generation sequencing, the gene dosage of chromosome 21-linked genes in fetal DNA can be determined with great precision. This has emerged as a sensitive and specific noninvasive method (\u201cliquid biopsy\u201d) for prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 as well as other trisomies. Currently, all cases of trisomy 21 identified by such liquid biopsies are confirmed by conventional cytogenetics on fetal cells obtained by amniocentesis. 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome"

Identiication of a structural chromosomal abnormality raises two primary questions. First, what phenotypic abnormalities or later developmental abnormalities are associated with this finding? Second, is evaluation of parental karyotype indicated-speciically, are the parents at increased risk of carrying this abnormality? If so, what is their risk of having future afected ofspring?"

As discussed in Chapter 14 (p. 286), when both major anomalies and minor aneuploidy markers are considered, an estimated 50 to 60 percent of Down syndrome pregnancies can be detected sonographically (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2016d). Approximately half of liveborn neonates with Down syndrome are found to have cardiac defects, particularly ventricular septal defects and endocardial cushion defects (Figs. 10-29 and 10-30, p. 202) (Bergstrom, 2016; Freeman, 2008). Gastrointestinal abnormalities are identiied in 12 percent and include esophageal atresia, Hirschsprung disease, and duodenal atresia (Fig. 10-38, p. 207) (Bull, 2011).

            "content": "Down syndrome, caused by an extra chromosome 21, is characterized by an atypical body habitus, mental retardation, cardiac malformations, an increased risk of leukemia, and a reduced life expectancy. The extra chromosome is almost always of maternal origin. Autoimmune thyroid disorders are more common in patients with Down syndrome than in the general population. The gene for autoimmune polyglandular syndrome I (APECED) was mapped to chromosome 21 and is thought to be a transcription factor involved in immune regulation (AIRE). This gene may play a role in the development of autoimmune thyroid disease in these patients (437). Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common type of thyroid disease in individuals with Down syndrome. Hypothyroidism develops in as many as 50% of patients older than age 40 with Down syndrome. These clinical syndromes and other evidence suggest part of the genetic susceptibility to Hashimoto thyroiditis may reside on chromosomes X and 21. Because of the increased"
