Creatine Creatine phosphate (also called phosphocreatine), the phosphorylated derivative of creatine found in muscle, is a high-energy compound that provides a small but rapidly mobilized reserve of high-energy phosphates that can be reversibly transferred to adenosine diphosphate (Fig. 21.19) to maintain the intracellular level of ATP during the first few minutes of intense muscular contraction. [Note: The amount of creatine phosphate in the body is proportional to the muscle mass.] 1. Synthesis: Creatine is synthesized in the liver and kidneys from glycine and the guanidino group of arginine, plus a methyl group from SAM (see Fig. 21.19). Animal products are dietary sources. Creatine is reversibly phosphorylated to creatine phosphate by creatine kinase, using ATP as the phosphate donor.

Ketone bodies, especially acetoacetate, are readily oxidized by the heart, and they are a major source of energy in diabetic acidosis. As is true of carbohydrate substrates, use of a specific noncarbohydrate is influenced by the presence of other substrates, whether noncarbohydrate or carbohydrate. Therefore, within certain limits, the heart preferentially uses the substrate that is available in the largest concentration. The oxidation of amino acids makes a small contribution to myocardial energy expenditure. Normally, the heart derives its energy by oxidative phosphorylation, in which each mole of glucose yields 36 mol of ATP. However, during hypoxia, glycolysis takes over, and 2 mol of ATP is provided by each mole of glucose; \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids is also curtailed. If hypoxia is prolonged, cellular creatine phosphate and eventually ATP are depleted."

These actions maintain a normal arterial PO2 when O2 utilization is increased and a normal PCO2 when CO2 production is increased. Additionally the hematocrit increases slightly to enhance O2-carrying capacity. This increase results from stimulation of erythropoietin production by the kidney. Normal function of skeletal muscles also requires optimal amounts of thyroid hormone. This requirement may be related to regulation of energy production and storage. Glycolysis and glycogenolysis are increased, whereas glycogen and creatine phosphate are reduced by thyroid hormone excess.

The ornithine will be combined with CP to form citrulline (see figure above). With ASL (and ASS) deficiency, citrulline accumulates and is excreted, thereby carrying waste nitrogen out of the body. Answer = D. In individuals with milder (partial) deficiencies in the enzymes of the urea cycle, hyperammonemia may be triggered by physiologic stress (for example, an illness or prolonged fasting) that decreases the insulin/counterregulatory hormone ratio. [Note: The degree of the hyperammonemia is usually less severe than that seen in the neonatal onset forms.] The shift in the ratio results, in part, in skeletal muscle proteolysis, and the amino acids that are released get degraded. Degradation involves transamination by pyridoxal phosphate\u2013requiring aminotransferases that generate the \u03b1-keto acid derivative of the amino acid + glutamate. The glutamate undergoes oxidative deamination to"

            "content": "Myopathy may complicate the course of HIV infection; causes include HIV infection itself, zidovudine, and the generalized wasting syndrome. HIV-associated myopathy may range in severity from an asymptomatic elevation in creatine kinase levels to a subacute syndrome characterized by proximal muscle weakness and myalgias. Quite pronounced elevations in creatine kinase may occur in asymptomatic patients, particularly after exercise. The clinical significance of this 1267 as an isolated laboratory finding is unclear. A variety of both inflammatory and noninflammatory pathologic processes have been noted in patients with more severe myopathy, including myofiber necrosis with inflammatory cells, nemaline rod bodies, cytoplasmic bodies, and mitochondrial abnormalities. Profound muscle wasting, often with muscle pain, may be seen after prolonged zidovudine therapy. This toxic side effect of the drug is dose-dependent and is related to its ability to interfere with the function of"

            "content": "F. The toxic ammonia generated from the amide nitrogen of amino acids is transported through blood as arginine. Correct answer = D. Glutamine, produced by the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids in muscle, is deaminated by glutaminase to ammonia + glutamate. The glutamate is deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase to ammonia + \u03b1ketoglutarate, which can be used for gluconeogenesis. Free amino acids are taken into enterocytes by several different sodium-linked transport systems. Healthy, well-fed individuals are in nitrogen balance, in which nitrogen input equals output. The liver converts ammonia to urea, and the kidneys use ammonia to buffer protons. Amino acid catabolism begins with transamination that generates glutamate. The glutamate undergoes oxidative deamination. Toxic ammonia is transported as glutamine and alanine. Arginine is synthesized and hydrolyzed in the hepatic urea cycle. For Questions 19.3\u201319.5, use the following scenario."
