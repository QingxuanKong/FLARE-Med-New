While recumbent positions are discussed in the context of certain medical procedures, there is no specific mention of a semi-recumbent posture being ideal for CPR.\\n\\nOption B, tilting the patient to the left to keep the heart perfused, is not a recommended position for CPR. The documents do not suggest any specific position that is designed to optimize cardiac perfusion during CPR.\\n\\nOption C, flat on a firm surface, is the correct answer. The American Heart Association and other medical guidelines recommend that CPR be performed on a firm, flat surface, such as a bed or table, to provide a stable platform for chest compressions. This position also allows for easy access to the patient's airway and allows the responder to maintain a stable position for the duration of the procedure.\\n\\nOption D, on the floor with the legs raised, is not a recommended position for CPR.

The patient is instructed to curl forward, trying to touch the nose to the umbilicus. It is important that the patient not simply lean forward onto a bedside tabletop, as this is not an optimal position for opening up the spinous processes. LP is sometimes more easily performed in obese patients if they are sitting. A disadvantage of the seated position is that measurement of opening pressure is not accurate. In situations in which LP is difficult using palpable spinal landmarks, bedside ultrasound to guide needle placement may be used. In some particularly difficult situations, a computed tomography (CT)-guided needle placement may be necessary."

There may be advantages to positioning the patient while awake to reduce the frequency of positioning-related complications. Laparoscopy is performed on an operating table that can be tipped to create a steep, head-down (Trendelenburg) position that allows the bowel to move out of the pelvis to facilitate visualization after the cannulas is placed.

The risks of the procedure As with all procedures and operations there is always a small risk of complication. These risks are always balanced against the potential benefits of the procedure. Placing the needle into the internal jugular vein can be performed under ultrasound guidance, which reduces the risk of puncturing the common carotid artery.

            "content": "If the test dose is negative, 10-15 mL of 0.0625-0.125% bupivacaine are injected to achieve a sensory TlO level. Ater 15 to 20 minutes, the block is assessed using loss of sensation to cold or pinprick. If no block is evident, the catheter is replaced. If the block is asymmetrical, the epidural catheter is withdrawn 0.5 to 1s.0 cm and an additional 5 to 10 mL of 0.0625-0.125% bupivacaine is injected. If the block remains inadequate, the catheter is replaced. The woman is positioned in the lateral or semilateral position to avoid aortocaval compression. Subsequently, maternal blood pressure is recorded every 5 to 15 minutes. The fetal heart rate is monitored continuously. The level of analgesia and intensity of motor blockade are assessed at least hourly. Reproduced with permission from Glosten B: Local anesthetic techniques.

            "content": "Patients who are comatose from the moment of injury require immediate neurologic attention and resuscitation. After intubation, with care taken to immobilize the cervical spine, the depth of coma, pupillary size and reactivity, limb movements, and Babinski responses are assessed. As soon as vital functions permit and cervical spine x-rays and a CT scan have been obtained, the patient should be transported to a critical care unit. Hypoxia should be reversed, and normal saline used as the resuscitation fluid in preference to albumin. The finding of an epidural or subdural hematoma or large intracerebral hemorrhage is usually an indication for prompt surgery and intracranial decompression in an otherwise salvageable patient. Measurement of ICP with a ventricular catheter or fiberoptic device in order to guide treatment has been favored by many units but has not improved outcome. Hyperosmolar intravenous solutions are used in various regimens to limit intracranial pressure. The inherently"

A chin-lift maneuver can be used as a last resort but should be avoided where possible, as it requires movement of the potentially unstable C-spine. An oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway may facilitate bag-mask ventilation. Perform intubation in patients with apnea, significantly depressed mental status (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] < 8), or impending airway compromise (e.g., significant maxillofacial trauma or inhalation injury in fires). Perform a surgical airway (cricothyroidotomy) in patients who cannot be intubated or in whom there is significant maxillofacial trauma, making intubation impractical. Maintain cervical spine stabilization/immobilization in trauma patients until the spine is appropriately cleared through exam and radiographic studies. However, never allow this concern to delay airway management."

The algorithm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia begins with and initial defibrillate on attempt. If a single shock fails to restore a pulse, it is followed by 2 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR; chest compressions), followed by another single shock. After three such sequences, epinephrine and then antiarrhythmic drugs are added to the protocol. See text for details. B. The algorithms for bradyarrhythmia/asystole (left) or pulseless electrical activity (right) are dominated first by continued life support and a search for reversible causes.

The patient is placed in supine position with arms tucked at both sides. Appropriate padding of extremities is important to avoid neuropraxia and trauma from robotic arm movements. Three trocars are typically used for TAPP repair. Open Hasson technique is employed for initial trocar placement at umbilicus; this can be an 8-mm trocar or alternatively a 12-mm with a tele-scoped 8-mm trochar. Additionally, two 8-mm trocars are placed in each side of the mid-abdomen, slightly above the level of umbi-licus. After trocar placement, the robot is docked and targeted, and the patient is placed in Trendelenburg position. Typically, the surgeon will use robotic shears attached to electrocautery, Cadiere forceps, and a needle holder as the primary instruments. This combination provides optimal cost-effectiveness because the majority of the"

This advance has inserted another level of response into the cardiac arrest paradigm. A number of studies have demonstrated that AED use by nonconventional responders in strategic response systems and public access lay responders can improve cardiac arrest survival rates. The rapidity with which defibrillation/cardioversion is achieved is an important element for successful resuscitation, both for ROSC and for protection of the central nervous system. Chest compressions should be carried out while the defibrillator is being charged. As soon as a diagnosis of VF or VT is established, a biphasic waveform shock of 150\u2013200 J (360 J if a monophasic waveform device is used) should be delivered.
