They detect changes in blood pressure and stretch, and respond by sending signals to the brain to adjust blood pressure. This is a direct and rapid response to changes in blood pressure.\\n\\nOption B: chemoreceptors - Chemoreceptors are sensors that detect changes in the chemical composition of the blood, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. While they can influence blood pressure, they are not primarily responsible for detecting changes in blood pressure itself.\\n\\nOption C: vasomotor centre - The vasomotor centre is a region in the brain that controls blood vessel diameter and, consequently, blood pressure. It receives signals from baroreceptors and chemoreceptors, but it is not a sensor itself.\\n\\nOption D: cardiovascular centre - The cardiovascular centre is a group of neurons in the brain that regulates heart rate, cardiac output, and blood pressure. While it plays a crucial role in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis, it is not a sensor for detecting changes in blood pressure.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is A. baroreceptors, as they are the primary sensors responsible for detecting changes in blood pressure.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Any mechanism that raises arterial blood pressure toward normal in response to a reduction in pressure is designated a negative feedback mechanism. This mechanism is termed negative because the direction of the secondary change in pressure is opposite the direction of the initiating change after the acute blood loss. The following negative feedback responses are evoked: baroreceptor reflexes, (2) chemoreceptor reflexes, (3) cerebral ischemia responses, (4) reabsorption of tissue fluids, release of endogenous vasoconstrictor substances, and renal conservation of salt and water."

One arterial baroreflex is mediated by stretch-sensitive sensory nerve endings in the carotid sinuses and the aortic arch. The rate of firing of these baroreceptors increases with arterial pressure, and the net effect is a decrease in sympathetic outflow, resulting in decreases in arterial pressure and heart rate. This is a primary mechanism for rapid buffering of acute fluctuations of arterial pressure that may occur during postural changes, behavioral or physiologic stress, and changes in blood volume. However, the activity of the baroreflex declines or adapts to sustained increases in arterial pressure such that the baroreceptors are reset to higher pressures. Patients with autonomic neuropathy and impaired baroreflex function may have extremely labile blood pressures with difficult-to-control episodic blood pressure spikes associated with tachycardia."

Both the autonomic and endocrine systems influence the muscular, cutaneous, and mesenteric (splanchnic) vascular beds, heart rate, and stroke volume of the heart. Together, these actions serve to maintain normal blood pressure and allow reflex maintenance of blood pressure with changes in body position. Two types of baroreceptors function as the afferent component of this reflex arc by sensing pressure gradients across the walls of large blood vessels. Those in the carotid sinus and aortic arch are sensitive to reductions in pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure), while those in the right heart chambers and pulmonary vessels respond more to alterations in blood volume.

The most important factor that leads to a change in vessel caliber is contraction of the circular smooth muscle cells in the vessel wall. Changes in internal pressure also alter the caliber of blood vessels and therefore alter the resistance to blood flow through these vessels. Blood vessels are elastic tubes. Hence, the greater the transmural pressure (i.e., the difference between internal and external pressure) across the wall of a vessel, the greater the caliber of the vessel and the less its hydraulic resistance. It is apparent from Fig. 15.3 that the greatest drop in pressure occurs in the very small arteries and arterioles.

Specific receptors throughout the body can trigger the release of AVP. Osmoreceptors located in the hypothalamus sense changes in blood osmolality from a mean of 285 mOSM/kg. Baroceptors sense changes in blood pressure caused by alterations in blood volume and are peripherally located in the walls of the left atrium, carotid sinus, and aortic arch (53). These receptors can respond to changes in blood volume of more than 10%.

The frequency of firing of these nerves is enhanced by an increase in arterial blood pressure and diminished by a reduction in arterial blood pressure. An increase in impulse frequency, as occurs with a rise in arterial pressure, inhibits the cerebral vasoconstrictor regions and results in peripheral vasodilation and lowering of arterial blood pressure. Bradycardia brought about by activation of the cardiac branches of the vagus nerves contributes to this lowering of blood pressure. The carotid sinus baroreceptors are more sensitive than those in the aortic arch. Changes in carotid sinus pressure evoke greater changes in systemic arterial pressure and peripheral resistance than do equivalent changes in aortic arch pressure."
