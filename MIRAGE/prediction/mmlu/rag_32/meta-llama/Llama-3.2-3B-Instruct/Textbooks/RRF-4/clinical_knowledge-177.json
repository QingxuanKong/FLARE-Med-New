This is justified in the great majority of cases. However, in some cases the distribution phase may not be ignored, particularly in connection with the calculation of loading doses. If the rate of absorption is rapid relative to distribution (this is always true for rapid intravenous administration), the concentration of drug in plasma that results from an appropriate loading dose\u2014calculated using the apparent volume of distribution\u2014can initially be considerably higher than desired. Severe toxicity may occur, albeit transiently. This may be particularly important, eg, in the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs such as lidocaine, where an almost immediate toxic response may occur. Thus, while the estimation of the amount of a loading dose may be quite correct, the rate of administration"

This applies to the initiation of chronic drug therapy (whether by multiple oral doses or by continuous intravenous infusion), a change in chronic drug dose or dosing interval, or discontinuation of drug. Steady state describes the situation during chronic drug administration when the amount of drug administered per unit time equals drug eliminated per unit time. With a continuous intravenous infusion, plasma concentrations at steady state are stable, while with chronic oral drug administration, plasma concentrations vary during the dosing interval but the time-concentration profile between dosing intervals is stable (Fig. 5-4)."

This delay may reflect the time required for the drug to distribute from plasma to the site of action. This will be the case for almost all drugs. The delay due to distribution is a pharmacokinetic phenomenon that can account for delays of a few minutes. This distributional process can account for the short delay of effects after rapid intravenous injection of central nervous system (CNS)\u2013active agents such as thiopental. Some drugs bind tightly to receptors, and it is the half-life of dissociation that determines the delay in effect, eg, for digoxin. Note that it is the dissociation process that controls the time to receptor equilibrium. This is exactly the same principle as the elimination process controlling the time to accumulate to steady state with a constant rate infusion (see Figure 3\u20133)."

While this variability has been perceived as an unpredictable, and therefore inevitable, accompaniment of drug therapy, this is not the case. The goal of this chapter is to describe the principles of clinical pharmacology that can be used for the safe and optimal use of available and new drugs."

Underlying conditions such as diarrhea or ileus can also affect the site of drug absorption and thereby alter bioavailability. Certain orally administered drugs have lower bioavailability because of the first-pass effect\u2014the process by which drugs are absorbed in the small intestine through the portal circulation and then directly transported to the liver for metabolism."

Microfold cells have a folded luminal surface and possess a thick layer of mucus that allows the entry of microbes to Peyer\u2019s patches. B. Microfold cells recognize several bacterial proteins by GP2 and release the material to the extracellular space by a process called transcytosis. C. Gut\u2011associated lymphoid tissues attract dendritic cells trough chemokines such as CCL20 and CCL9. D. Pathogens such as Yersinia pestis and Shigella target microfold cells to gain access to the subepithelial space. 12.2 True or False: Intraepithelial lymphocytes are mostly CD4 T cells, in contrast to the lamina propria, where CD8 T cells predominate. 12.3 Matching: Match each chemokine or chemokine receptor to its tissue homing function. A. CXCL13 i. Recruitment of lymphocytes to the colon, lactating mammary gland, and salivary glands 12.4 Multiple Choice: Which of the following is a correct statement?"

Fifty percent of the steady-state concentration is reached after one half-life, 75% after two half-lives, and over 90% after four half-lives. Dashed line: Plasma concentrations reflecting drug elimination after a constant-rate infusion of a drug had reached steady state. Fifty percent of the drug is lost after one half-life, 75% after two half-lives, etc. The \u201crule of thumb\u201d that four half-lives must elapse after starting a drug-dosing regimen before full effects will be seen is based on the approach of the accumulation curve to over 90% of the final steady-state concentration."
