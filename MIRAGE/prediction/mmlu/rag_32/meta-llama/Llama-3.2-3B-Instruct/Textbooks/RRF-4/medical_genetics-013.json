Sickle-cell disease is caused by a single-point mutation in the gene that encodes the -globin chain of hemoglobin A. The result of this mutation is an abnormal -globin chain in which the amino acid valine is substituted for glutamic acid in position 6.

The result of this mutation is an abnormal -globin chain in which the amino acid valine is substituted for glutamic acid in position 6. Hemoglobin containing this abnormal -globin chain is designated sickle hemoglobin (HbS). The substitution of the hydrophobic valine for the hydrophilic glutamic acid causes HbS to aggregate under conditions of reduced oxygen tension. Instead of the normal biconcave disc shape, many of the erythrocytes become sickle-shaped at low oxygen tension, hence the name of this disease (Fig. F10.3.1). Sickled erythrocytes are more rigid than normal cells and adhere more readily to the endothelial surface. Thus, sickled erythrocytes may pile up in the smallest capillaries, depriving portions of tissues and organs of oxygen and nutrients. Large-vessel obstruction may also occur, which in children frequently leads to stroke."

It occurs primarily in the African American population, affecting 1 in 500 newborn African American infants. Sickle cell anemia is an autosomalrecessive disorder. It occurs in individuals who have inherited two mutant genes (one from each parent) that code for synthesis of the \u03b2 chains of the globin molecules.

Hemoglobinopathies are a group of hereditary disorders caused by inherited mutations that lead to structural abnormalities in hemoglobin. Sickle cell anemia, the prototypic hemoglobinopathy, is caused by a mutation in \u03b2-globin that creates sickle hemoglobin (HbS). Numerous other hemoglobinopathies have been described, but these are infrequent and beyond the scope of this discussion. Sickle cell anemia is the most common familial hemolytic anemia. In parts of Africa where malaria is endemic, the gene frequency approaches 30% as a result of a protective effect against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In the United States, approximately 8% of blacks are heterozygous HbS carriers and about 1 in 600 have sickle cell anemia."

Some patients remain virtually asymptomatic into or even through adult life, while others suffer repeated crises requiring hospitalization from early childhood. Patients with sickle thalassemia and sickle-HbE tend to have similar, slightly milder symptoms, perhaps because of the ameliorating effects of production of other hemoglobins within the RBC. Hemoglobin SC disease, one of the more common variants of sickle cell anemia, is frequently marked by lesser degrees of hemolytic anemia and a greater propensity for the development of retinopathy and aseptic necrosis of bones. In most respects, however, the clinical manifestations resemble sickle cell anemia. Some rare hemoglobin variants actually aggravate the sickling phenomenon."

The mutation in the \u03b2-globin chain of hemoglobin giving rise to sickle cell anemia is an excellent example of a point mutation that alters the meaning of the genetic code. Such mutations are sometimes called missense mutations. By contrast, certain point mutations may change an amino acid codon to a chain termination codon, or a stop codon.

Allele frequencies may vary because certain allelic variants confer a selective advantage. For example, heterozygotes for the sickle cell mutation, which is particularly common in West Africa, are more resistant to malarial infection because the erythrocytes of heterozygotes provide a less favorable environment for Plasmodium parasites. Although homozygosity for the sickle cell mutation is associated with severe anemia and sickle crises (Chap. 127), heterozygotes have a higher probability of survival because of the reduced morbidity and mortality from malaria; this phenomenon has led to an increased frequency of the mutant allele.

DNA, isolated from white blood cells (WBC) and amplified, is denatured and applied to a membrane. A radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe, complementary to the point mutation (GAG \u2192 GTG, glutamate \u2192 valine) at codon 6 in patients with the \u03b2S gene, is applied to the membrane. DNA isolated from a heterozygous individual (sickle cell trait) or a homozygous patient (sickle cell anemia) contains a sequence that is complementary to the probe and a double-stranded hybrid form can be detected. In contrast, DNA obtained from normal individuals is not complementary at this position and, therefore, does not form a hybrid (see Fig. 34.11). Use of a pair of such ASO probes (one specific for the normal allele and one specific for the mutant allele) allows all three possible genotypes (homozygous normal, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant) to be distinguished (Fig. 34.12)."

            "content": "autosomal recessive DisorDers In recessive disorders, the mutated alleles result in a complete or partial loss of function. They frequently involve enzymes in metabolic pathways, receptors, or proteins in signaling cascades. In an autosomal recessive disease, the affected individual, who can be of either sex, is a homozygote or compound heterozygote for a single-gene defect. With a few important exceptions, autosomal recessive diseases are rare and often occur in the context of parental consanguinity. The relatively high frequency of certain recessive disorders such as sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and thalassemia, is partially explained by a selective biologic advantage for the heterozygous state (see below). Although heterozygous carriers of a defective allele are usually clinically normal, they may display subtle differences in phenotype that only become apparent with more precise testing or in the context of certain environmental influences. In sickle the offspring of"

For example, heterozygotes for the sickle cell gene are less susceptible to the severe malaria caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum. This organism spends an obligatory part of its life cycle in the RBC. One theory is that because these cells in individuals heterozygous for HbS, like those in homozygotes, have a shorter life span than normal, the parasite cannot complete the intracellular stage of its development. This may provide a selective advantage to heterozygotes living in regions where malaria is a major cause of death. For example, in Africa, the geographic distribution of sickle cell anemia is similar to that of malaria. B. Hemoglobin C disease"

For example, patients inheriting sickle \u03b2 thalassemia exhibit features of \u03b2 thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. The \u03b1 chain is present in HbA, HbA2, and HbF; \u03b1-chain mutations thus cause abnormalities in all three. The \u03b1-globin hemoglobinopathies are symptomatic in utero and after birth because normal function of the \u03b1-globin gene is required throughout gestation and adult life. In contrast, infants with \u03b2-globin hemoglobinopathies tend to be asymptomatic until 3\u20139 months of age, when HbA has largely replaced HbF. Prevention or partial reversion of the switch should thus be an effective therapeutic strategy for \u03b2-chain hemoglobinopathies."
