Also, taste and smell are interdependent clinically, as the appreciation of the flavor of food and drink depends to a large extent on its aroma, and an abnormality of one of these senses is frequently misinterpreted as an abnormality of the other. In comparison to sight and hearing, taste and smell play a less critical role in the life of the individual.

In other animals, the chemical senses have greater survival value, and their activation evokes a number of social behaviors, including mating, territoriality, and feeding. The stimuli that we commonly know as tastes are actually mixtures of five elementary taste qualities: salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami.

San Diego, CA: Academic Press; 2002.) people avoid consuming spoiled food and detect dangerous situations. For example, an unpleasant odorant is added to odorless, colorless natural gas so that people can easily detect a leak. Odor has more primary qualities than taste does. As many as 1000 different odor receptors are coded in the human genome, and although only approximately 350 types are functional, they represent the largest population of G protein\u2013coupled receptors in the genome. The olfactory mucosa also contains somatosensory receptors of the trigeminal nerve. When performing clinical tests of olfaction, clinicians must avoid activating these somatosensory receptors with thermal or noxious stimuli, such as the ammonia used in \u201csmelling salts.\u201d"
