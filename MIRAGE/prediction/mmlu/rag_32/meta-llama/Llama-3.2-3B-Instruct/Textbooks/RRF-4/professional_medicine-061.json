She is now 5 ft 4 in tall and weighs 88 lb, with a BMI of 15 kg/m^2, indicating severe underweight. Her pulse is 54/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, both of which are lower than normal. She is also a member of her high school gymnastics team, which may indicate excessive physical activity. The patient is unconcerned about her amenorrhea, which suggests that she may be unaware of the potential health implications. The low BMI and physical signs (e.g., low blood pressure, low pulse) suggest that the patient may be experiencing starvation or malnutrition. The most likely cause of this patient's amenorrhea is starvation or malnutrition, which is a form of secondary amenorrhea. This is supported by the fact that the patient is a member of a high school gymnastics team, which may contribute to her excessive physical activity and potential malnutrition. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (B) is unlikely, as the patient's menstrual cycles were regular until they became irregular. Hyperthyroidism (A) and hypothyroidism (C) are not supported by the patient's symptoms or physical examination. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (D) is also unlikely, as the patient's menstrual cycles were regular until they became irregular. The patient's severe underweight and low physical signs suggest starvation or malnutrition as the most likely cause of her amenorrhea.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Absent or irregular menses may be an indication that a woman has a medical condition that can affect her overall health. The health implications can vary depending on the etiology of the amenorrhea. Therefore, a cause for amenorrhea should be established whenever possible. When gonadal failure occurs in conjunction with primary amenorrhea, it is associated with a high incidence of abnormal karyotype.

However, other factors, such as growth, secondary sexual characteristics, the presence of cyclic pelvic pain, and the secular trend toward an earlier age of menarche, particularly in African-American girls, also influence the age at which primary amenorrhea should be investigated. Thus, an evaluation for amenorrhea should be initiated by age 15 or 16 in the presence of normal growth and secondary sexual characteristics; age 13 in the absence of secondary sexual characteristics or if height is less than the third percentile; age 12 or 13 in the presence of breast development and cyclic pelvic pain; or within 2 years of breast development if menarche, defined by the first menstrual period, has not occurred."

At her annual physical examination, a 53-year-old middle school teacher complains that she has been having difficulty falling asleep, and after falling asleep, she awakens several times during the night. These episodes now occur almost nightly and are interfering with her ability to teach. She has tried various over-the-counter sleep remedies, but they were of little help and she experienced \u201changover\u201d effects on the day following their use. Her general health is good, she is"

            "content": "A 69-year-old retired teacher presents with a 1-month history of palpitations, intermittent shortness of breath, and fatigue. She has a history of hypertension. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

She is comatose, tachypneic (25 breaths per minute), and tachycardic (150 bpm), but she appears flushed, and fingertip pulse oximetry is normal (97%) breathing room air. Questioning of her parents reveals that they are homeless and have been living in their car (a small van). The nights have been cold, and they have used a small char-coal burner to keep warm inside the vehicle. What is the most likely diagnosis? What treatment should be instituted immediately? If her mother is pregnant, what additional measures should be taken?"

WHO Group I includes women with no evidence of endogenous estrogen production, normal or low FSH levels, normal prolactin levels, and no lesion in the hypothalamic-pituitary region. WHO Group II is associated with evidence of estrogen production and normal levels of prolactin and FSH. WHO Group III includes individuals with elevated serum FSH indicating gonadal insufficiency or failure. To detect the cause of amenorrhea, it is useful to determine whether secondary sexual characteristics are present (Fig. 30.1). The absence of secondary sexual characteristics indicates that a woman was never exposed to estrogen."

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min).

Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice?
