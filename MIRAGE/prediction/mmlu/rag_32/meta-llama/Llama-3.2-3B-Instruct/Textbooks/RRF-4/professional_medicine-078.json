A needle biopsy of the prostate gland is done on all men with serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations greater than 5 ng/mL (N<4). One hundred men undergo biopsy procedures; 90 are found to have prostate cancer, and five are found to have chronic prostatitis.

    "predict": "To calculate the sensitivity of the test, we need to determine the number of true positives (i.e., men with prostate cancer who test positive for prostate cancer) and the total number of men who actually have prostate cancer. Given information: * 100 men undergo biopsy procedures * 90 men are found to have prostate cancer * 5 men are found to have chronic prostatitis (not cancer) First, we need to calculate the number of men who actually have prostate cancer (true positives and those with chronic prostatitis, as they are not true positives): True positives = 90 (men with prostate cancer) Sensitivity = (True positives) / (True positives + False negatives) To calculate the false negatives, we need to know the total number of men who have prostate cancer. We can calculate this by subtracting the number of men with chronic prostatitis from the total number of men who underwent biopsy: Total men with prostate cancer = True positives + False negatives False negatives = Total men with prostate cancer - True positives False negatives = 100 - 90 = 10 Now, we can calculate the sensitivity: Sensitivity = (True positives) / (True positives + False negatives) = 90 / (90 + 10) = 90 / 100 = 0.9 However, this is not one of the options. We need to consider the option that directly involves the number of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen. To calculate the sensitivity, we can use the following formula: Sensitivity = (True positives) / (True positives + False negatives) = (Number of men with test results > 5 ng/mL and normal biopsy) / (Total men with test results > 5 ng/mL) Since we don't have the total number of men with test results > 5 ng/mL, we need to calculate it. We know that 100 men underwent biopsy procedures, and 90 have prostate cancer, and 5 have chronic prostatitis. Therefore, the number of men with test results > 5 ng/mL and normal biopsy is: Number of men with test results > 5 ng/mL and normal biopsy = True positives = 90 However, we also need to include the 5 men with chronic prostatitis who have test results > 5 ng/mL but are not true positives. Therefore, the total number of men with test results > 5 ng/mL is: Total men with test results > 5 ng/mL = True positives + Men with chronic prostatitis and test results > 5 ng/mL = 90 + 5 = 95 Now we can calculate the sensitivity: Sensitivity = (True positives) / (True positives + False negatives) = 90 / (90 + 5) = 90 / 95 = 0.947 However, none of the options exactly match this calculation. The closest match is option B, which involves the number of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen. Therefore, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the sensitivity of the test, we need to determine the number of true positives (men with prostate cancer who test positive) and the total number of men who actually have prostate cancer. We can calculate the number of false negatives by subtracting the number of true positives from the total number of men who underwent biopsy. The sensitivity is then calculated by dividing the number of true positives by the sum of true positives and false negatives.

However, based on the commonly used cut point for prostate biopsy (a total PSA \u22654 ng/mL), most men with a PSA elevation do not have histologic evidence of prostate cancer at biopsy. In addition, many men with PSA levels below this cut point harbor cancer cells in their prostate. Information from the PCPT demonstrates that there is no PSA below which the risk of prostate cancer is zero. Thus, the PSA level establishes the likelihood that a man will harbor cancer if he undergoes a prostate biopsy. The goal is to increase the sensitivity of the test for younger men more likely to die of the disease and to reduce the frequency of detecting cancers of low malignant potential in elderly men more likely to die of other causes. Patients with symptomatic prostatitis should have a course of antibiotics before biopsy. However, the routine use of antibiotics in an asymptomatic man with an elevated PSA level is"

The level of PSA in blood is strongly associated with the risk and outcome of prostate cancer. A single PSA measured at age 60 is associated (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.90) with lifetime risk of death from prostate cancer.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an androgen-regulated serine protease produced by the pros-tate epithelium. PSA is normally present in low concentrations in the blood of all adult males. PSA levels may be elevated in the blood of men with benign prostate conditions such as pros-tatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia, as well as in men with prostate cancer.

The 90% confidence interval for the change in PSA values in men with benign prostatic hypertrophy, measured 3\u20136 months apart, is 1.4 ng/mL. Therefore, the Endocrine Society expert panel suggested that an increase in PSA >1.4 ng/mL in any 1 year after starting testosterone therapy, if confirmed, should lead to urologic evaluation.

In normal conditions, PSA is secreted into prostatic gland alveoli and ultimately incorporated into seminal fluid. The alveolar secretion from the prostate gland is pumped into the prostatic urethra during ejaculation by contraction of the fibromuscular tissue of the prostate. Because PSA is predominately released into prostatic secretion, only a very small amount of PSA (usually below 4 ng/mL) is circulating in the blood of a healthy individual. However, in prostate cancer, serum concentration of PSA increases; large amounts of PSA are produced and misdirected into the circulation by the transformed prostatic epithelium. Therefore, the elevated levels of PSA are directly related to increased activity of the prostatic cancer cells. A PSA level between 4 and 10 ng/mL suggests about 25% percent cancer risk; levels above 10 ng/mL suggest a risk greater than 67%. An"

Although PSA screening can detect prostate cancers early in their course, studies of the natural history of the disease (so-called \u201cwatch-and-wait studies\u201d) have confirmed that many prostate cancers are clinically insignificant, requiring no treatment, sometimes for decades. Overtreatment of these indolent cancers can cause significant morbidity, particularly erectile dysfunction and incontinence. A second limitation of PSA as a biomarker is that it is not cancer-specific. BPH, prostatitis, prostatic infarcts, instrumentation of the prostate, and ejaculation all may increase serum PSA levels. Conversely, 20% to 40% of patients with organ-confined prostate cancer have PSA values below the cutoffs that are used to identify patients who are likely to have prostate cancer."

Prostate cancer typically occurs in the peripheral zone of the prostate (see Fig. 5.48) and is relatively asymptomatic. In many cases, it is diagnosed by a digital rectal examination (DRE) (Fig. 5.49A) and by blood tests, which include serum acid phosphatase and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In rectal exams, the tumorous prostate feels \u201crock\u201d hard. The diagnosis is usually made by obtaining a number of biopsies of the prostate. Ultrasound is used during the biopsy procedure to image the prostate for the purpose of taking measurements and for needle placement. Ultrasound can also be used to aid planning radiotherapy by placing special metal markers, called fiducials, under direct ultrasound guidance, through the rectal wall into or near the tumor. This allows maximization of the radiation dose to the tumor while protecting healthy tissue."

The application of these assays is considered with many of the specific forms of neoplasia discussed in other chapters, so only a few examples suffice here. PSA, used to screen for prostatic adenocarcinoma, is one of the most frequently used tumor markers in clinical practice. Prostatic carcinoma can be suspected when elevated levels of PSA are found in the blood. However, PSA screening also highlights problems encountered with use of virtually every tumor marker. Although PSA levels often are elevated in cancer, PSA levels also may be elevated in benign prostatic hyperplasia (Chapter 18). Furthermore, there is no PSA level that ensures that a patient does not have prostate cancer. Thus,"

            "content": "elevated in cancer, PSA levels also may be elevated in benign prostatic hyperplasia (Chapter 18). Furthermore, there is no PSA level that ensures that a patient does not have prostate cancer. Thus, the PSA test suffers from both low sensitivity and low specificity, and its use as a screening tool has become quite controversial. The PSA assay is extremely valuable, however, for detecting residual disease or recurrence following treatment for prostate cancer. Other tumor markers used in clinical practice include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is elaborated by carcinomas of the colon, pancreas, stomach, and breast, and alpha fetoprotein (AFP), which is produced by hepatocellular carcinomas, yolk sac remnants in the gonads, and occasionally teratocarcinomas and embryonal cell carcinomas. Like PSA, CEA and AFP can be elevated in a variety of non-neoplastic conditions and thus also lack the specificity and sensitivity required for the early detection of cancers, but they may be"

The PLCO Cancer Screening Trial was a multicenter U.S. trial that randomized almost 77,000 men age 55\u201374 years to receive either annual PSA testing for 6 years or usual care. At 13 years of follow-up, no statistically significant difference in the number of prostate cancer deaths were noted between the arms (rate ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval 0.87\u20131.36). Approximately 50% of men in the control arm received at least one PSA test during the trial, which may have potentially diluted a small effect."

The absolute number of prostate cancer deaths has decreased in the past 5 years, which has been attributed by some to the widespread use of PSA-based detection strategies. However, the benefit of screening on survival is unclear. The paradox of management is that although 1 in 6 men will eventually be diagnosed with the disease, and the disease remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men, only 1 man in 30 with prostate cancer will die of his disease."
