On examination, there is bruising of the perineum and pain is elicited with motion of his pelvis. Blood is noted at the urethral meatus. There is no other penile trauma. A plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus and retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption. Which of the following portions of the urethra would be at greatest risk for injury in this patient?",

The presence of blood at the urethral meatus and the fracture of the superior pubic ramus are indicative of a urethral injury. The retrograde urethrography is a diagnostic tool used to evaluate for urethral disruption. The anatomy of the male urethra is different from the female urethra, and the location of the injury is crucial in determining the type of urethral injury. The membranous urethra is the portion of the urethra that passes through the deep perineal pouch and is surrounded by the external urethral sphincter. The membranous urethra is the most common site of urethral injury in males, especially in the context of pelvic fractures. The patient's symptoms and the location of the fracture suggest that the membranous urethra is at greatest risk for injury. The membranous urethra is also a common site for urethral disruption in cases of straddle injuries, which can occur when a person's legs are forced apart, such as in motorcycle accidents. Therefore, the membranous urethra is the most likely location of the injury in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The commonest injury is a rupture of the proximal spongy urethra below the perineal membrane. The urethra is usually torn when structures of the perineum are caught between a hard object (e.g., a steel beam or crossbar of a bicycle) and the inferior pubic arch. Urine escapes through the rupture into the superficial perineal pouch and descends into the scrotum and up onto the anterior abdominal wall deep to the superficial fascia. In association with severe pelvic fractures, urethral rupture may occur at the prostatomembranous junction above the deep perineal pouch. The urine will extravasate into the true pelvis."

Pelvic fractures are generally of four types. Type 1 injuries occur without disruption of the bony pelvic ring (e.g., a fracture of the iliac crest). These types of injuries are unlikely to represent significant trauma, though in the case of a fracture of the iliac crest, blood loss needs to be assessed. Type 2 injuries occur with a single break in the bony pelvic ring. An example of this would be a single fracture with diastasis (separation) of the symphysis pubis. Again, these injuries are relatively benign in nature, but it may be appropriate to assess for blood loss. Type 3 injuries occur with double breaks in the bony pelvic ring. These include bilateral fractures of the pubic rami, which may produce urethral damage. Type 4 injuries occur at and around the acetabulum."

Urine may therefore be readily drained from a distended bladder without significant concern for urethral rupture. Occasionally, it is impossible to pass any form of instrumentation through the urethra to drain the bladder, usually because there is a urethral stricture or prostatic enlargement. In such cases, an ultrasound of the lower abdomen will demonstrate a full bladder (Fig. 5.46) behind the anterior abdominal wall. A suprapubic catheter may be inserted into the bladder with minimal trauma through a small incision under local anesthetic. In the clinic"

A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."

When inserting urinary catheters, it is important to appreciate the gender anatomy of the patient. In men: The spongy urethra is surrounded by the erectile tissue of the bulb of the penis immediately inferior to the deep perineal pouch. The wall of this short segment of urethra is relatively thin and angles superiorly to pass through the deep perineal pouch; at this position the urethra is vulnerable to damage, notably during cystoscopy. The membranous part of the urethra runs superiorly as it passes through the deep perineal pouch. The prostatic part of the urethra takes a slight concave curve anteriorly as it passes through the prostate gland."

Vaginal examination with a speculum should be performed in women with pelvic fractures to exclude an open fracture. Specific injuries, their associated signs and symptoms, diagnostic options, and treatments are discussed in detail later in this chapter.Adjuncts to the physical examination include vital sign and ECG monitoring, nasogastric tube placement, Foley cath-eter placement, radiographs, hemoglobin, base deficit measure-ments, urinalysis, and repeat FAST exam. A nasogastric tube should be inserted in all intubated patients to decrease the risk of gastric aspiration, but it may not be necessary in the awake patient. Nasogastric tube placement in patients with complex mid-facial fractures is contraindicated; rather, a tube should be placed orally if required. Nasogastric tube evaluation of stomach contents for blood may suggest occult gastroduodenal injury, or the errant path of the"

            "content": "Because it is a ring, displacement can only occur if the ring is disrupted in two places. This may occur either from frac-tures of the bones or tears of the ligaments that can cause dis-location. When you see an anterior fracture of the ring, check for a posterior injury (Fig. 43-12). There are three main fracture patterns that occur from trauma to the pelvis. An anteroposterior force to the pelvis causes an \u201copen book\u201d injury pattern in which the pelvis springs open, hinged on the intact posterior ligaments with widening of the pubic symphysis. A lateral compression pattern results from a crush injury that causes fractures to the ilium, sacrum, and pubic rami. Vertical shear injuries are very unstable since they result from disruption of the strong posterior pelvic ligaments and are associated with significant blood loss and visceral injuries. Fractures of the sacrum may be difficult to see on X-ray, and therefore CT scans are often needed to completely visualize the fracture"
