    "question": "A 37-year-old woman with AIDS comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of progressive diarrhea and a 1.8- kg (4-lb) weight loss. During the past week, she has had six large watery stools daily. She is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. She is employed as a flight attendant and works regularly on domestic flights throughout the USA. She also flies to Asia at least once monthly. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 112/64 mm Hg. The abdomen is scaphoid. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 400/mm3 (Normal\u2265500). Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Cryptosporidium parvum",
        "B": "Cytomegalovirus",
        "C": "Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex",
        "D": "Salmonella enteritidis"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms, medical history, and immunocompromised status. The patient has a history of AIDS, which indicates a weakened immune system. She is also receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but this may not be sufficient to prevent opportunistic infections. The patient presents with progressive diarrhea and significant weight loss over the past month, with recent worsening over the past week. She has a history of working as a flight attendant and traveling frequently, which increases her risk of exposure to various pathogens. Given her immunocompromised status and symptoms, we need to consider opportunistic pathogens that commonly affect individuals with HIV/AIDS. The patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 400/mm3, which is lower than the normal range, further increasing her susceptibility to opportunistic infections. The most common opportunistic pathogens in HIV/AIDS patients with CD4+ counts < 200/mm3 include Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC). However, the patient's symptoms of progressive diarrhea and significant weight loss are more suggestive of a gastrointestinal opportunistic infection. Among the options provided, Cryptosporidium parvum is a common cause of diarrhea in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV/AIDS. It is a protozoan parasite that can cause severe diarrhea and malabsorption, leading to significant weight loss and dehydration. Given the patient's travel history and immunocompromised status, Cryptosporidium parvum is a plausible causal organism. The other options, Cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, and Salmonella enteritidis, are less likely to cause the patient's symptoms. Cytomegalovirus can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, but it is more commonly associated with other opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex is a common cause of diarrhea in immunocompromised patients, but it is typically associated with more systemic symptoms and a lower CD4+ count. Salmonella enteritidis is a bacterial cause of gastroenteritis, but it is less likely to cause severe diarrhea and weight loss in an immunocompromised patient. Therefore, the most likely causal organism is Cryptosporidium parvum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

In immunocompetent persons, symptoms develop after an incubation period of ~1 week and consist principally of watery nonbloody diarrhea, sometimes in conjunction with abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia, fever, and/or weight loss. In these hosts, the illness usually subsides after 1\u20132 weeks. In contrast, in immunocompromised hosts (especially those with AIDS and CD4+ T cell counts <100/\u03bcL), diarrhea can be chronic, persistent, and remarkably profuse, causing clinically significant fluid and electrolyte depletion. Stool volumes may range from 1 to 25 L/d. Weight loss, wasting, and abdominal pain may be severe. Biliary tract involvement can manifest as mid-epigastric or right-upper-quadrant pain."

The risk of opportunistic infections and other AIDS-defining conditions is related to the depletion of CD4 T cells. A combination of CD4 cell count and percentage and clinical manifestations is used to classify HIV infection in children (Tables 125-1 and 125-2). Initial symptoms with vertical transmission vary and may include failure to thrive, neurodevelopmental delay, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, chronic or recurrent diarrhea, interstitial pneumonia, or oral thrush.

Prior to the widespread use of cART it was the initial AIDS-defining condition in ~10% of patients with AIDS in the United States and is an indication for initiation of cART. Generalized wasting is rarely seen today with the earlier initiation of antiretrovirals. A constant feature of this syndrome is severe muscle wasting with scattered myofiber degeneration and occasional evidence of myositis. Glucocorticoids may be of some benefit; however, this approach must be carefully weighed against the risk of compounding the immunodeficiency of HIV infection. Androgenic steroids, growth hormone, and total parenteral nutrition have been used as therapeutic interventions with variable success."

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

The medical history should reveal the setting in which lymphadenopathy is occurring. Symptoms such as sore throat, cough, fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, or pain in the nodes should be sought. The patient\u2019s age, sex, occupation, exposure to pets, sexual behavior, and use of drugs such as diphenylhydantoin are other important historic points. For example, children and young adults usually have benign (i.e., nonmalignant) disorders that account for the observed lymphadenopathy such as viral or bacterial upper respiratory infections; infectious mononucleosis; toxoplasmosis; and, in some countries, tuberculosis. In contrast, after age 50, the incidence of malignant disorders increases and that of benign disorders decreases."

Of cases, approximately a third is associated with hepatitis B antigenemia (Langford, 2015). Symptoms are nonspecific, and fever, weight loss, and malaise are present in more than half of cases. Diagnosis is made by biopsy, and treatment consists of high-dose prednisone plus cyclophosphamide. Vasculitis due to hepatitis B antigenemia responds to antivirals, glucocorticosteroids, and plasma exchange (Chap. 55, p. 1063). Only a few reports describe polyarteritis nodosa associated with pregnancy. Of 12 afected gravidas, polyarteritis first manifested during pregnancy in seven, and it was rapidly fatal by 6 weeks postpartum (Owen, 1989). he diagnosis was not made until autopsy in six of the seven women. Four women continued pregnancy, which resulted in one stillborn and three successful outcomes."
