Two CMAP bursts generated by facial motor neurons are observed: the first (R1) appears ipsilaterally 10 ms after the stimulus and the second (R2), ipsilaterally at 30 ms and contralaterally up to 5 ms later. The amplitudes of the responses vary considerably and are not in themselves clinically important. The first response is not visible as a muscular contraction but may serve some preparatory function by shortening the blink reflex delay.

            "content": "Separating the lateral wall of the orbit from the floor of the orbit is a longitudinal opening, the inferior orbital fissure (Fig. 8.88). Its borders are the greater wing of the sphenoid and the maxilla, palatine, and zygomatic bones. This long fissure allows communication between: the orbit and the pterygopalatine fossa posteriorly, the orbit and the infratemporal fossa in the middle, and the orbit and the temporal fossa posterolaterally. Passing through the inferior orbital fissure are the maxillary nerve [V2] and its zygomatic branch, the infra-orbital vessels, and a vein communicating with the pterygoid plexus of veins. Beginning posteriorly and crossing about two-thirds of the inferior orbital fissure, a groove (the infra-orbital groove) is encountered, which continues anteriorly across the floor of the orbit (Fig. 8.88). This groove connects with the infra-orbital canal that opens onto the face at the infra-orbital foramen."

            "content": "The infra-orbital nerve, part of the maxillary nerve [V2], and vessels pass through this structure as they exit onto the face. Associated with the medial wall of the bony orbit are several smaller openings (Fig. 8.88). The anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina are at the junction between the superior and medial walls. These openings provide exits from the orbit into the ethmoid bone for the anterior and posterior ethmoidal nerves and vessels. Completing the openings on the medial wall is a canal in the lower part of the wall anteriorly. Clearly visible is the depression for the lacrimal sac formed by the lacrimal bone and the frontal process of the maxilla. This depression is continuous with the nasolacrimal canal, which leads to the inferior nasal meatus. Contained within the nasolacrimal canal is the nasolacrimal duct, a part of the lacrimal apparatus."

            "content": "The first is superior orbital fissure syndrome. Cranial nerves III (oculo-motor nerve), IV (trochlear nerve), and VI (abducens nerve), and the first division of cranial nerve V (VI, trigeminal nerve) pass into the orbit from the base of the skull and into the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. Direct fractures of the pos-terior orbit or localized swelling caused by a fracture nearby can cause compression of these nerves. Symptoms include eyelid ptosis, protrusion of the globe (proptosis), paralysis of the extra-ocular muscles, and anesthesia supraorbital and trochlear nerve distributions. The second condition to remember is orbital apex syndrome. This is the most severe circumstance in which supe-rior orbital fissure syndrome is combined with signs of optic nerve (cranial nerve II) compression manifested visual changes ranging up to complete blindness. This is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment to prevent permanent loss of function.Zygomaticomaxillary"
