Step 2: Recall the relevant documents - Documents [0], [1], [2], [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [13], and [14] are relevant to the structure and function of the spinal nerves and their roots. Step 3: Identify the key information - From Document [0], we know that the sensory nerves are incorporated into plexi (lumbosacral, brachial plexus) and then divide into the dorsal roots, and all the sensory neurons have their cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia. Step 4: Eliminate incorrect options - Based on the key information, we can eliminate options C and D, as motor neuronal processes are not contained in the dorsal roots. We can also eliminate option B, as autonomic neuronal processes are not mentioned as being contained in the dorsal roots. Step 5: Choose the correct answer - Based on the analysis, the correct answer is A, as the dorsal roots of all spinal nerves contain sensory neuronal processes. Final answer: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The dorsal roots of all spinal nerves contain sensory neuronal processes, as they are the peripheral extensions of sensory neurons and carry information from the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

These roots intermingle with neighboring ones to form plexuses and then form the peripheral nerves. Although the muscles are innervated in patterns largely corresponding to segments of the spinal cord (a myotome), each large muscle is usually supplied by two or more roots. In contrast, a single peripheral nerve usually provides the complete motor innervation of a muscle or group of muscles. For this reason, paralysis caused by disease of the anterior horn cells or anterior roots has a different topographic pattern than paralysis following interruption of a peripheral nerve. These patterns follow the distribution shown in Table 43-1.

            "content": "Nerve root injury (radiculopathy) is a common cause of neck, arm, low back, buttock, and leg pain (see Figs. 31-2 and 31-3). The nerve roots exit at a level above their respective vertebral bodies in the cervical region (e.g., the C7 nerve root exits at the C6-C7 level) and below their respective vertebral bodies in the thoracic and lumbar regions (e.g., the T1 nerve root exits at the T1-T2 level). The cervical nerve roots follow a short intraspinal course before exiting. By contrast, because the spinal cord ends at the vertebral L1 or L2 level, the lumbar nerve roots follow a long intraspinal course and can be injured anywhere from the upper lumbar spine to their exit at the intervertebral foramen. For example, disk herniation at the L4-L5 level can produce not only L5 root compression, but also compression of the traversing S1 nerve root (Fig. 22-3). The lumbar nerve roots are mobile in the spinal canal, but eventually pass through the narrow lateral recess of the spinal canal and"

            "content": "Fig. 7.1A. The dorsal columns are formed by ascending branches of the large myelinated axons of dorsal root ganglion cells (the first-order neurons). These axons enter at each spinal segmental level and travel rostrally up to the caudal medulla to synapse in one of the dorsal column nuclei: the nucleus gracilis, which receives information from the lower part of the body and leg, and the nucleus cuneatus, which receives information from the upper part of the body and arm. Note that across the dorsal columns and across the dorsal column nuclei there is a somatotopic representation of the body, with the legs represented most medially, followed by the trunk and then the upper limb. This somatotopy is a consequence of newly entering afferents being added to the lateral border of the dorsal funiculus as the spinal cord is ascended. Such somatotopic maps are present at all levels in the somatosensory system, at least through the primary sensory cortices."

            "content": "The cell bodies of the visceral motor neurons outside the CNS often associate with each other in a discrete mass called a ganglion. Visceral sensory and motor fibers enter and leave the CNS with their somatic equivalents (Fig. 1.40). Visceral sensory fibers enter the spinal cord together with somatic sensory fibers through posterior roots of spinal nerves. Preganglionic fibers of visceral motor neurons exit the spinal cord in the anterior roots of spinal nerves, along with fibers from somatic motor neurons. Postganglionic fibers traveling to visceral elements in the periphery are found in the posterior and anterior rami (branches) of spinal nerves. Visceral motor and sensory fibers that travel to and from viscera form named visceral branches that are separate from the somatic branches. These nerves generally form plexuses from which arise branches to the viscera. Visceral motor and sensory fibers do not enter and leave the CNS at all levels (Fig. 1.41):"

            "content": "Each spinal nerve divides, as it emerges from an intervertebral foramen, into two major branches: a small posterior ramus and a much larger anterior ramus (Fig. 2.61): The posterior rami innervate only intrinsic back muscles (the epaxial muscles) and an associated narrow strip of skin on the back. The anterior rami innervate most other skeletal muscles (the hypaxial muscles) of the body, including those of the limbs and trunk, and most remaining areas of the skin, except for certain regions of the head. Near the point of division into anterior and posterior rami, each spinal nerve gives rise to two to four small recurrent meningeal (sinuvertebral) nerves (see Fig. 2.59). These nerves reenter the intervertebral foramen to supply dura, ligaments, intervertebral discs, and blood vessels. All major somatic plexuses (cervical, brachial, lumbar, and sacral) are formed by anterior rami."
