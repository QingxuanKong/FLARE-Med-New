A cosmopolitan species is one that is widely distributed across different geographic regions and environments. Let's evaluate each option in the context of this definition.\\n\\nOption A, extreme habitat specialization, refers to a species that has a narrow range of habitats and is adapted to a specific environment. This would not allow a species to become cosmopolitan, as it would be limited to a specific region.\\n\\nOption B, K-selected reproductive rate, refers to a species that has a slow reproductive rate, resulting in fewer offspring and a slower population growth rate. This would not enable a species to colonize and spread to new regions, making it less likely to become cosmopolitan.\\n\\nOption C, limited dispersal abilities, refers to a species that is unable to move or disperse to new areas, which would hinder its ability to colonize and establish populations in new regions.\\n\\nOption D, capacity for long-distance dispersal, refers to a species that can move or disperse to new areas, allowing it to colonize and establish populations in different regions. This would enable a species to become cosmopolitan in distribution.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is D.

For those mutations that do become fixed, the mathematics shows that the average time to fixation is approximately 4N generations. Detailed analyses of data on human genetic variation have suggested an ancestral population size of approximately 10,000 at the time when the current pattern of genetic variation was largely established. With a population that has reached this size, the probability that a new, selectively neutral mutation would become fixed is small (1/20,000), while the average time to fixation would be on the order of 800,000 years (assuming a 20-year generation time).

Thus, for example, many present-day proteins are formed as a patchwork of domains from different origins, reflecting their complex evolutionary history (see Figure 3\u201317). Neutral mutations Often Spread to become Fixed in a Population, with a Probability That Depends on Population Size In comparisons between two species that have diverged from one another by millions of years, it makes little difference which individuals from each species are Figure 4\u201377 Schematic view of an antibody (immunoglobulin) molecule."

            "content": "Living things are not confined to the familiar temperate realm of land, water, and sunlight inhabited by plants and plant-eating animals. They can be found in the darkest depths of the ocean, in hot volcanic mud, in pools beneath the frozen surface of the Antarctic, and buried kilometers deep in the Earth\u2019s crust. The creatures that live in these extreme environments are generally unfamiliar, not only because they are inaccessible, but also because they are mostly microscopic. In more homely habitats, too, most organisms are too small for us to see without special equipment: they tend to go unnoticed, unless they cause a disease or rot the timbers of our houses. Yet microorganisms make up most of the total mass of living matter on our planet. Only recently, through new methods of molecular analysis and specifically through the analysis of DNA sequences, have we begun to get a picture of life on Earth that is not grossly distorted by our biased perspective as large animals living on"
