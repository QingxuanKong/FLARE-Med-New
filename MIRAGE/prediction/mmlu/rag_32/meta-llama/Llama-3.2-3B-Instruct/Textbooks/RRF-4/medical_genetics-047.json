It is actually a weed, and its use as a food crop is not significant.\\n\\nOption B: it is an endangered species - There is no indication that Arabidopsis is an endangered species. In fact, it is widely cultivated for research purposes.\\n\\nOption C: it is the closest to humans of any existing plant - Arabidopsis is not the closest to humans in terms of evolutionary relationship. According to document [5], Arabidopsis is one of 300,000 species of flowering plants, and its genome size is about 220 million nucleotide pairs, which is relatively large compared to other organisms.\\n\\nOption D: it is a small plant with a small genome size which can be raised inexpensively - This option is correct. Arabidopsis is a small plant that can be grown indoors in large numbers, and its genome size is relatively small compared to other organisms, making it an ideal model organism for genetic research.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

If the nutrients and growth regulators are carefully manipulated, one can induce the formation of a shoot within the callus, and in many species a whole new plant can be regenerated from such shoots. In a number of plants\u2014including tobacco, petunia, carrot, potato, and Arabidopsis\u2014a single cell from such a callus (known as a totipotent cell) can be grown into a small clump of cells from which a whole plant can be regenerated (see Figure 7\u20132B).

A disc is cut out of a leaf and incubated in a culture of Agrobacterium that carries a recombinant plasmid with both a selectable marker and a desired genetically engineered gene. The wounded plant cells at the edge of the disc release substances that attract the bacteria, which inject their DNA into the plant cells. Only those plant cells that take up the appropriate DNA and express the selectable marker gene survive and proliferate and form a callus. The manipulation of growth factors supplied to the callus induces it to form shoots, which subsequently root and grow into adult plants carrying the engineered gene."

Plants synthesize a class of steroids that are called brassinosteroids because they were originally identified in the mustard family Brassicaceae, which includes Arabidopsis. These signal molecules regulate the growth and differentiation of plants throughout their life cycle. Binding of a brassinosteroid to a Bri1 cell-surface receptor kinase initiates an intracellular signaling cascade that uses a GSK3 protein kinase and a protein phosphatase to regulate the phosphorylation and degradation of specific transcription regulatory proteins in the nucleus, and thereby specific gene transcription. Mutant plants that are deficient in the Bri1 receptor kinase are insensitive to brassinosteroids and are therefore dwarfs."

            "content": "Because defects in genes that are required for fundamental cell processes\u2014 RNA synthesis and processing or cell-cycle control, for example\u2014are usually lethal, the functions of these genes are often studied in individuals with Figure 8\u201344 Insertional mutant of the snapdragon, Antirrhinum. A mutation in a single gene coding for a regulatory protein causes leafy shoots (left) to develop in place of flowers, which occur in the normal plant (right). The mutation causes cells to adopt a character that would be appropriate to a different part of the normal plant, so instead of a flower, the cells produce a leafy shoot.

A similar conclusion came from experiments performed with plants. When differentiated pieces of plant tissue are placed in culture and then dissociated into single cells, often one of these individual cells can regenerate an entire adult plant (Figure 7\u20132B). And the same principle has been more recently demonstrated in mammals that include sheep, cattle, pigs, goats, dogs, and mice (Figure 7\u20132C)."
