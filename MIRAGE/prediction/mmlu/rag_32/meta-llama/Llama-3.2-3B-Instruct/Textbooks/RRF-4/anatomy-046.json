Unlike bone fractures, damage to ligaments is unlikely to be appreciated on plain radiographs. When a fracture is noted on a plain radiograph, the physician must always be aware that there may also be appreciable ligamentous disruption. The Ottawa ankle rules were developed to assist clinicians in deciding whether patients with acute ankle injuries require investigation with radiographs in order to avoid unnecessary studies. Named after the hospital where they were developed, the rules are highly sensitive and have reduced the utilization of unwarranted ankle radiographs since their implementation.

The ankle joint and related structures can be regarded as a fibro-osseous ring oriented in the coronal plane. The upper part of the ring is formed by the joint between the distal ends of the fibula and tibia and by the ankle joint itself. The sides of the ring are formed by the ligaments that connect the medial malleolus and lateral malleolus to the adjacent tarsal bones. The bottom of the ring is not part of the ankle joint, but consists of the subtalar joint and the associated ligaments. Visualizing the ankle joint and surrounding structures as a fibro-osseous ring allows the physician to predict the type of damage likely to result from a particular type of injury. For example, an inversion injury may fracture the medial malleolus and tear ligaments anchoring the lateral malleolus to the tarsal bones."

Sometimes damage to the nerve can be iatrogenic, that is, damaged during arthroscopy or knee surgery. Symptoms of common fibular nerve injury are often observed in bed-bound patients, particularly in those with decreased levels of consciousness, due to prolonged external pressure to the knee leading to nerve compression and neuropathy. Similarly, application of a tight cast or a brace to the leg can compress the nerve, producing symptoms of fibular muscle palsy.

Widening of the space between the distal tibia and fibula after fixing the fractures is indicative of a syndesmo-sis injury, and an intraoperative external rotation stress radio-graph can be helpful for evaluation.

There are many tests and techniques for examining the knee joint, including the following. Lachman\u2019s test\u2014the patient lies on the couch. The examiner places one hand around the distal femur and the other around the proximal tibia and then elevates the knee, producing 20\u00b0 of flexion. The patient\u2019s heel rests on the couch. The examiner\u2019s thumb must be on the tibial tuberosity. The hand on the tibia applies a brisk anteriorly directed force. If the movement of the tibia on the femur comes to a sudden stop, it is a firm endpoint. If it does not come to a sudden stop, the endpoint is described as soft and is associated with a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament."

A standard, anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique view of the hand or wrist (as appropriate) is rapid, inexpensive, and usually provides sufficient information about the bony structures to achieve a diagnosis in conjunction with the symptoms and findings.6Lucencies within the bone should be noted. Most com-monly, these represent fractures, but they can on occasion rep-resent"

If there is evidence of diminished pulses after reduction, an angiogram must be performed. If the pulses are absent after reduction, immediate surgical explora-tion and/or repair should be done by a vascular surgeon. Pro-phylactic fasciotomy of the leg is usually done. Time is critical to reestablish the circulation of the limb. If ischemia time is more than 8 hours, then there is a very high rate of amputation. With regard to the ligamentous injuries, an external fixator may be initially used to stabilize the unstable knee and protect the reduction. Subsequently, an MRI will identify what structures have been torn. Because a dislocation causes so much damage to the knee, a delayed multiligamentous reconstruction is recom-mended on an elective basis in order to stabilize the knee joint. Figure 43-17.

Nerves related to bone The common fibular branch of the sciatic nerve curves laterally around the neck of the fibula when passing from the popliteal fossa into the leg (Fig. 6.20). The nerve can be rolled against bone just distal to the attachment of biceps femoris to the head of the fibula. In this location, the nerve can be damaged by impact injuries, fractures to the bone, or leg casts that are placed too high. Large veins embedded in the subcutaneous (superficial) fascia of the lower limb (Fig. 6.21) often become distended (varicose). These vessels can also be used for vascular transplantation. The most important superficial veins are the great and small saphenous veins, which originate from the medial and lateral sides, respectively, of a dorsal venous arch in the foot."

Tibial frac-tures, both closed and open, can be associated with compart-ment syndrome. Patients usually have pain out of proportion with swelling of the leg and pain with passive stretch. Com-partment pressure within 30 mmHg of the diastolic pressure is diagnostic of compartment syndrome.Tibial Plafond (Pilon) FracturesThe tibial plafond is the distal tibial articular surface of the ankle joint. Pilon fractures are typically high-energy injuries that usu-ally result from axial compression. These injuries can cause significant soft tissue injury, severely comminuted intra-articular and metaphyseal fragments (Fig. 43-19A,B), and wound heal-ing problems, making these fractures very difficult to treat. Due to the soft tissue injury, these fractures are initially treated with external fixation until the swelling subsides, which may take"
