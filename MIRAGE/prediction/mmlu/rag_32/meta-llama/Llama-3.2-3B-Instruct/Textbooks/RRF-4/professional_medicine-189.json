Because body hair is felt by many to be culturally unacceptable in women and girls, sensitive questioning about specific hair removal techniques (bleaching, waxing, use of depilatories, shaving, plucking, threading) is warranted during an examination. A complete pelvic examination is appropriate in patients who are sexually active, are having severe pain, or may have an anatomic anomaly. Testing for gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis infection is appropriate during a speculum examination if the patient is sexually active.

Thus, an evaluation for amenorrhea should be initiated by age 15 or 16 in the presence of normal growth and secondary sexual characteristics; age 13 in the absence of secondary sexual characteristics or if height is less than the third percentile; age 12 or 13 in the presence of breast development and cyclic pelvic pain; or within 2 years of breast development if menarche, defined by the first menstrual period, has not occurred."

For example, for healthy teens without symptoms who are requesting oral contraceptives before the initiation of intercourse, a gynecologic examination is not necessarily required. Some aspects of the examination\u2014such as assessment of vital signs and measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, and calculation of a body mass index\u2014 should be performed routinely during most office visits. Typically, examination of the breasts and abdomen and a complete examination of the pelvis are considered to be essential parts of the gynecologic examination. It is often helpful to ask the patient if the gynecologic examination was difficult for her in the past; this"

As regular, ovulatory cycles become established, pain with menstruation (dysmenorrhea) is a frequent complaint. Available @ StudentConsult.com Primary amenorrhea is the complete absence of menstruation by 16 years of age in the presence of breast development or by 14 years of age in the absence of breast development. However 98% of adolescents have onset of menarche by age 15; therefore, investigations should begin at that age in young women without menses. Secondary amenorrhea refers to the cessation of menses for more than 3 consecutive months, any time after menarche."

When the results of the examination are normal, the patient can be reassured accordingly. When there is a possible abnormality, the patient should be informed immediately; this discussion should take place after the examination with the patient clothed. A plan to evaluate the findings should be outlined brie\ufb02y and in clear, understandable language. Figure 1.4 The rectovaginal examination. The implications and timing of any proposed procedure (e.g., biopsy) should be discussed, and the patient should be informed when the results of any tests will be available."

            "content": "Adolescent Patients A pelvic examination may be less revealing in an adolescent than in an older woman, particularly if it is the patient\u2019s first examination or if it takes place on an emergency basis. An adolescent who presents with excessive bleeding should have a pelvic examination if she had intercourse, if the results of a pregnancy test are positive, if she has abdominal pain, if she is markedly anemic, or if she is bleeding heavily enough to compromise hemodynamic stability. The pelvic examination occasionally may be deferred in young teenagers who have a classic history of irregular cycles soon after menarche, who have normal hematocrit levels, who deny sexual activity, and who will reliably return for follow-up. A pelvic examination may be deferred in adolescents who present to the office requesting oral contraceptives before the initiation of intercourse or at the patient\u2019s request, even if she has had intercourse.

In some persons it may be expressed only as hypogonadism, but most patients have a distinctive body habitus with an increase in length between the soles and the pubic bone, which creates the appearance of an elongated body. Also characteristic is eunuchoid body habitus. Reduced facial, body, and pubic hair and gynecomastia also are frequently seen. The testes are markedly reduced in size, sometimes to only 2 cm in greatest dimension. In keeping with the testicular atrophy, the serum testosterone levels are lower than normal, and urinary gonadotropin levels are elevated."
