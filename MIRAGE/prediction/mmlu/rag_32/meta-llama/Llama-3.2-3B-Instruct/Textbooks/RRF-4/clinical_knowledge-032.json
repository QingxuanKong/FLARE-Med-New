Normally, thyroid hormones are produced in response to TSH and limit their own production by inhibiting the production of TSH by the pituitary (left panels). In Graves\u2019 disease, the autoantibodies are agonists for the TSH receptor and therefore stimulate the production of thyroid hormones (right panels).

Antithyroid peroxidase and antithyroglobulin antibodies may be present in thyrotoxicosis, although the values are usually lower than in Hashimoto thyroiditis. Exceptionally high titers of antibodies may indicate the thyrotoxic phase of Hashimoto thyroiditis with the subsequent evolution toward permanent hypothyroidism. In Graves disease, serum free T4 or T3 or both levels are elevated, whereas TSH is suppressed. Rare causes of hyperthyroidism include McCune-Albright syndrome, thyroid nodule (often an adenoma), TSH hypersecretion, subacute"

            "content": "The most common form of hyperthyroidism is Graves\u2019 disease, or diffuse toxic goiter. The presenting signs and symptoms of Graves\u2019 disease are set forth in Table 38\u20134. Graves\u2019 disease is considered to be an autoimmune disorder in which a defect in suppressor T lymphocytes stimulates B lymphocytes to synthesize antibodies (TSH-R Ab [stim]) to thyroidal antigens. The TSH-R Ab [stim] is directed against the TSH receptor in the thyroid cell membrane and stimulates growth and biosynthetic activity of the thyroid cell. Genetics, the postpartum state, cigarette smoking, and physical and emotional stress increase TSH-R Ab [stim] development. A genetic predisposition is shown by a high frequency of HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3 in Caucasians, HLA-Bw46 and HLA-B5 in Chinese, and HLA-B17 in African Americans. Spontaneous remission occurs but some patients require years of antithyroid therapy."

            "content": "The management of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is complicated by the fact that there are different causes of thyrotoxicosis and because the increased thyroid hormone levels exacerbate underlying arrhythmias and coronary artery disease. Amiodarone treatment causes thyrotoxicosis in 10% of patients living in areas of low iodine intake and in 2% of patients in regions of high iodine intake. There are two major forms of AIT, although some patients have features of both. Type 1 AIT is associated with an underlying thyroid abnormality (preclinical Graves\u2019 disease or nodular goiter). Thyroid hormone synthesis becomes excessive as a result of increased iodine exposure (Jod-Basedow phenomenon). Type 2 AIT occurs in individuals with no intrinsic thyroid abnormalities and is the result of drug-induced lysosomal activation leading to destructive thyroiditis with histiocyte accumulation in the thyroid; the incidence rises as cumulative amiodarone dosage increases. Mild forms of type 2"

            "content": "Differential Diagnosis Diagnosis of Graves\u2019 disease is straightforward in a patient with biochemically confirmed thyrotoxicosis, diffuse goiter on palpation, ophthalmopathy, and often a personal or family history of autoimmune disorders. For patients with thyrotoxicosis who lack these features, the diagnosis is generally established by a radionuclide (99mTc, 123I, or 131I) scan and uptake of the thyroid, which will distinguish the diffuse, high uptake of Graves\u2019 disease from destructive thyroiditis, ectopic thyroid tissue, and factitious thyrotoxicosis. Scintigraphy is the preferred diagnostic test; however, TRAb measurement can be used to assess autoimmune activity. In secondary hyperthyroidism due to a 2296 TSH-secreting pituitary tumor, there is also a diffuse goiter. The presence of a nonsuppressed TSH level and the finding of a pituitary tumor on CT or magnetic resonance scan (MRI) scan suggest this diagnosis. Clinical features of thyrotoxicosis can mimic certain aspects of other"

            "content": "In most patients with hyperthyroidism, T3, T4, FT4, and FT3 are elevated and TSH is suppressed (Table 38\u20132). Radioiodine uptake is usually markedly elevated as well. Antithyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase, and TSH-R Ab [stim] antibodies are usually present. Management of Graves\u2019 Disease The three primary methods for controlling hyperthyroidism are antithyroid drug therapy, destruction of the gland with radioactive iodine, and surgical thyroidectomy. None of these methods alters the underlying pathogenesis of the disease. A. Antithyroid Drug Therapy Drug therapy is most useful in young patients with small glands and mild disease. Methimazole (preferred) or propylthiouracil is administered until the disease undergoes spontaneous remission. This is the only therapy that leaves an intact thyroid gland, but it does require a long period of treatment and observation (12\u201318 months), and there is a 50\u201360% incidence of relapse."

            "content": "Pathophysiology The thyroid shows a characteristic patchy inflammatory infiltrate with disruption of the thyroid follicles and multinucleated giant cells within some follicles. The follicular changes progress to granulomas accompanied by fibrosis. Finally, the thyroid returns to normal, usually several months after onset. During the initial phase of follicular destruction, there is release of Tg and thyroid hormones, leading to increased circulating T4 and T3 and suppression of TSH (Fig. 405-10). During this destructive phase, radioactive iodine uptake is low or undetectable. After several weeks, the thyroid is depleted of stored thyroid hormone and a phase of hypothyroidism typically occurs, with low unbound T4 (and sometimes T3) and moderately increased TSH levels. Radioactive iodine uptake returns to normal or is even increased as a result of the rise in TSH. Finally, thyroid hormone and TSH levels return to normal as the disease subsides."
