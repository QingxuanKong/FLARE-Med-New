The infantile form is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with macrocephaly, loss of motor skills, increased startle reaction, and a macular cherry red spot. The juvenile-onset form presents as ataxia and dementia, with death by age 10\u201315 years. The adult-onset disorder is characterized by clumsiness in childhood; progressive motor weakness in adolescence; and additional spinocerebellar and lower-motor-neuron symptoms and dysarthria in adulthood. Intelligence declines slowly, and psychosis is common. Screening for Tay-Sachs disease carriers is recommended in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Sandhoff disease, due to a deficiency in both Hex A and Hex B resulting from defective \u03b2-chains, is phenotypically similar to Tay-Sachs disease but also includes hepatosplenomegaly and bony dysplasias."

Depending on the ganglioside involved, these disorders are subclassified into GM1 and GM2 categories. Tay-Sachs disease, by far the most common of all gangliosidoses, is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the \u03b2 subunit of the enzyme hexosaminidase A, which is necessary for the degradation of GM2. More than 100 mutations have been described; most disrupt protein folding or intracellular transport. Tay-Sachs disease, similar to other lipid storage disorders, is most common among http://ebooksmedicine.net Ashkenazi Jews, among whom the frequency of heterozygous carriers is estimated to be 1 in 30. Heterozygote carriers can be detected by measuring the level of hexosaminidase in the serum or by DNA sequencing."

            "content": "In recent years, numerous variants of hexosaminidase A and B deficiency have been identified. They differ clinically from Tay-Sachs disease in having a later onset, less-extensive brain involvement (cortical neurons relatively spared and intense affection of basal ganglia, as well as cerebellar and spinal neurons). Accordingly, the clinical expression of the variants appearing in childhood, adolescence, and adult life takes the form of athetosis, dystonia, ataxia, and motor neuron paralysis; mental function can be normal. The process has also been found in a few congenital cases in which there was a rapidly progressive decline of a microcephalic infant.

            "content": "The life ex-pectancy across the entire group of people with these disorders is 15 years. The frst LSD was described in 1881 by British ophthalmologist Warren Tay, who reported symp-toms of retinal abnormalities in a 12-month-old infant with severe neuromuscular symptoms. In 1896, U.S. neurologist Bernard Sachs described a patient with similar eye symp-toms found earlier by Tay. This disease is now known as Tay-Sachs disease. It is caused by the absence of one enzyme, a lysosomal galactosidase ( -hexosaminidase) that catalyzes a step in lysosomal breakdown of ganglio-sides in neurons. The resulting accumulation of the GM2 ganglioside that is found within concentric lamellated struc-tures in residual bodies of neurons interferes with normal cell function. Children born with LSDs usually appear normal at birth; however, they soon show clinical signs of the disease. They often experience slower growth, show changes in fa-cial features, and develop bone and joint deformities that lead to"
