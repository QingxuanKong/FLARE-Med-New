Many chloroplast proteins, including the protein subunits of the photosynthetic system and of the ATP synthase (discussed in Chapter 14), are located in the thylakoid membrane. Like the precursors of some mitochondrial proteins, the precursors of these proteins are translocated from the cytosol to their final destination in two steps. First, they pass across the double membrane into the matrix space (called the stroma in chloroplasts), and then they either integrate into the thylakoid membrane or translocate into the thylakoid space (Figure 12\u201326A). The precursors of these proteins have a hydrophobic thylakoid signal sequence following the N-terminal chloroplast signal sequence. After the N-terminal signal sequence has been used to import the protein into the stroma, a stromal signal peptidase removes it, unmasking the thylakoid signal sequence that initiates transport"

Instead, the electron-transport chains, photosynthetic light-capturing systems, and ATP synthase are all contained in the thylakoid membrane, a separate, distinct mem-brane that forms a set of flattened, disc-like sacs, the thylakoids. The thylakoid membrane is highly folded into numerous local stacks of flattened vesicles called grana, interconnected by nonstacked thylakoids. The lumen of each thylakoid is connected with the lumen of other thylakoids, thereby defining a third internal compartment called the thylakoid space.

Both processes occur post-translationally, use separate translocation complexes in each membrane, require energy, and use amphiphilic N-terminal signal sequences that are removed after use. With the exception of some of the chaperone molecules, however, the protein components that form the translocation complexes differ. Moreover, whereas mitochondria harness the electrochemical H+ gradient across their inner membrane to drive transport, chloroplasts, which have an electrochemical H+ gradient across their thylakoid membrane but not their inner membrane, use GTP and ATP hydrolysis to power import across their double membrane.

            "content": "In contrast to chloroplasts, the h+ gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane is insufficient for atp production, and mitochondria need a membrane potential to bring the proton-motive force to the same level as in chloroplasts. the arrangement of the mitochondrial atp synthase in rows of dimers along the cristae ridges (see Figure 14\u201332) next to the respiratory-chain proton pumps may help the flow of protons along the membrane surface toward the atp synthase, as the availability of protons is limiting for atp production. In the chloroplast, the atp synthase is distributed randomly in thylakoid membranes. ATP-driven proton pump working in reverse to make ATP"

            "content": "the Chloroplast atp Synthase Uses the proton Gradient Generated by the photosynthetic Light reactions to produce atp The sequence of events that results in light-driven production of ATP and NADPH in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria is summarized in Figure 14\u201352. Starting with the withdrawal of electrons from water, the light-driven charge-separation steps in photosystems II and I enable the energetically unfavorable (uphill) flow of electrons from water to NADPH (see Figure 14\u201347). Three small mobile electron carriers\u2014plastoquinone, plastocyanin, and ferredoxin\u2014participate in this process. Together with the electron-driven proton pump of the cytochrome b6-f complex, the photosystems generate a large proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. The ATP synthase molecules embedded in the thylakoid membranes then harness this proton gradient to produce large amounts of ATP in the chloroplast stroma, mimicking the synthesis of ATP in the mitochondrial matrix."
