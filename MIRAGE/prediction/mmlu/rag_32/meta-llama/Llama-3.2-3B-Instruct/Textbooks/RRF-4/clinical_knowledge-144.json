    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, let's break down the concept of the energy charge of a cell. The energy charge of a cell refers to the total amount of energy available to the cell for various cellular processes. This energy is primarily obtained from the breakdown of nutrients and the storage of energy-rich molecules such as ATP. The sodium-potassium ATPase is a crucial enzyme responsible for maintaining the energy balance in the cell by pumping sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions into the cell, which helps to generate the membrane potential. However, it is not the source of the energy charge itself. The overall rate of energy use by the cell is also not the energy charge, as it refers to the rate at which energy is consumed by the cell for various processes. The extent to which the total adenine nucleotide pool is phosphorylated is also not the energy charge, as it refers to the extent of energy storage in the form of ATP. Therefore, the correct answer is the difference between the charge on the outside and inside of a cell, which is also known as the membrane potential or resting membrane potential.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

            "content": "Where does the heat that the cell releases come from? Here we encounter another important law of thermodynamics. The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can be converted from one form to another, but that it cannot be created or destroyed. Figure 2\u201317 illustrates some interconversions between different forms of energy. The amount of energy in different forms will change as a result of the chemical reactions inside the cell, but the first law tells us that the total amount of energy must always be the same. For example, an animal cell takes in foodstuffs and converts some of the energy present in the chemical bonds between the atoms of these food molecules (chemical-bond energy) into the random thermal motion of molecules (heat energy)."

A small flow of inorganic ions through an ion channel carries sufficient charge to cause a large change in the membrane potential. The ions that give rise to the membrane potential lie in a thin (< 1 nm) surface layer close to the membrane, held there by their electrical attraction to their oppositely charged counterparts (counterions) on the other side of the membrane. For a typical cell, 1 microcoulomb of charge (6 \u00d7 1012 monovalent ions) per square centimeter of membrane, transferred from one side of the membrane to the other, changes the membrane potential by roughly 1 V. This means, for example, that in a spherical cell of diameter 10 \u03bcm, the number of K+ ions that have to flow out to alter the membrane potential by 100 mV is only about 1/100,000 of the total number of K+ ions in the cytosol. This amount is so minute that the intracellular K+ concentration remains virtually unchanged."

The number of ions that go to form the layer of charge adjacent to the membrane is minute compared with the total number inside the cell. For example, the movement of 6000 Na+ ions across 1 \u00b5m2 of membrane will carry suffcient charge to shift the membrane potential by about 100 mV. Because there are about 3 \u00d7 107 Na+ ions in a typical cell (1 \u00b5m3 of bulk cytoplasm), such a movement of charge will generally have a negligible effect on the ion concentration gradients across the membrane."

This balancing role is performed largely by K+, which is actively pumped into the cell by the Na+K+ pump and can also move freely in or out through the K+ leak channels in the plasma membrane. Because of the presence of these channels, K+ comes almost to equilibrium, where an electrical force exerted by an excess of negative charges attracting K+ into the cell balances the tendency of K+ to leak out down its concentration gradient. The membrane potential (of the plasma membrane) is the manifestation of this electrical force, and we can calculate its equilibrium value from the steepness of the K+ concentration gradient. The following argument may help to make this clear."

It then uses this energy to generate order within itself. In the course of the chemical reactions that generate order, the cell converts part of the energy it uses into heat.

If the solute is an ion, moving it into a cell across a membrane whose inside is at a voltage V relative to the outside will cause an additional free-energy change (per mole of solute moved) of \u00b0Gvolt = zFV. At the point where the concentration and voltage gradients just balance, and the ion distribution is at equilibrium across the membrane. Thus, and, therefore, or, using the constant that converts natural logarithms to base 10, V = 2.3 log10 For a univalent cation, 2.3 = 58 mV at 20oC and 61.5 mV at 37oC. Thus, for such an ion at 37\u00baC, V = + 61.5 mV for Co/ Ci = 10, whereas V = 0 for Co / Ci= 1. The K+ equilibrium potential (VK), for example, is 61.5 log10([K+]o / [K+]i) millivolts (\u201389 mV for a typical cell, where [K+]o = 5 mM and [K+]i = 140 mM). At VK, there is no net fow of K+ across the membrane."

Those starting with a gray carbon atom show only part of a molecule. examples of molecules containing such bonds are given on the right, with the standard free-energy change for hydrolysis in kilojoules. The transfer of a phosphate group from one molecule to another is energetically favorable if the free-energy change (\u0394G) for hydrolysis of the phosphate bond of the first molecule is more negative than that for hydrolysis of the phosphate bond in the second. Thus, under standard conditions, a phosphate group is readily transferred from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to aDp to form aTp. (standard conditions often do not pertain to living cells, where the relative concentrations of reactants and products will influence the actual change in free energy.) The hydrolysis reaction can be viewed as the transfer of the"

In this example, the amount of heat released by the oxidation reaction is reduced by exactly the amount of energy stored in the energy-rich covalent bonds of the activated carrier molecule. And the activated carrier molecule picks up a packet of energy of a size sufficient to power a chemical reaction elsewhere in the cell. aTp is the most Widely Used activated Carrier molecule"

Any such system will contain molecules with a total energy E. This energy will be distributed in a variety of ways: some as the translational energy of the molecules, some as their vibrational and rotational energies, but most as the bonding energies between the individual atoms that make up the molecules.

As discussed in Chapter 2, acids donate protons and bases accept them (see Panel 2\u20132, p. 93). Acids and bases exist in conjugate acid\u2013base pairs, in which the acid is readily converted into the base by the loss of a proton. For example, acetic acid (CH3COOH) is converted into its conjugate base, the acetate ion (CH3COO\u2013), in the reaction: In an exactly analogous way, pairs of compounds such as NADH and NAD+ are called redox pairs, since NADH is converted to NAD+ by the loss of electrons in the reaction:"
