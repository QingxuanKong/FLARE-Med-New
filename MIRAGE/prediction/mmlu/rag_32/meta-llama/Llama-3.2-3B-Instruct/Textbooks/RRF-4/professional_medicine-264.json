The first step is to confirm the result and determine the cause of the elevated MSAFP level. The next step is to consider the patient's medical history, including her history of recent oral contraceptive use and the possibility of a missed menstrual period. The patient's symptoms and medical history do not suggest a clear indication for amniocentesis or triple screening. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to repeat the measurement of MSAFP concentration to confirm the result and to rule out laboratory error. This will also allow for a re-evaluation of the patient's symptoms and medical history to determine the cause of the elevated MSAFP level.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Women currently have the option of neural-tube defect screening with MSAFP, sonography, or both (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2016). Serum screening is generally performed between 15 and 20 weeks' gestation. And, if using an upper threshold of 2.5 multiples of the median (MoM), the anticipated detection rate is at least 90 percent for fetal anencephaly and 80 percent for myelomeningocele. Targeted sonography is the preferred diagnostic test, and in addition to characterizing the neural-tube defect, it may identiy other abnormalities or conditions that also result in MSAFP elevation (Table 14-6, p. 283)."

Ultrasound screening can reveal structural or functional anomalies in the fetus, which might be associated with chromosome or genomic disorders. Follow-up chromosome studies may therefore be recommended. Maternal serum screening results are the third most frequent indication for prenatal chromosome analysis. There have been several versions of maternal serum screening offered over the past few decades. Currently, the \u201cquad\u201d screen analyzes levels of \u03b1 fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), estriol, and inhibin-A.

The beginning of widespread serum screening came in 1977, after a collaborative trial from the United Kingdom established the association between elevated maternal serum AFP levels (MSAFP) and fetal open neural-tube defects (Wald, 1977). When screening was performed at 16 to 18 weeks' gestation, detection approached 90 percent for pregnancies with fetal anencephaly and 80 percent for those with myelomeningocele (spina biida). hese sensitivities are comparable to current testing (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 20 16a)."

Measurement of the MSAFP concentration between 15 and 20 weeks' gestation has been ofered as part of routine prenatal care for more than 30 years. Because AFP is the major protein in fetal serum, analogous to albumin in a child or adult, the normal concentration gradient between fetal plasma and maternal serum is on the order of 50,000: 1.

Serum placental growth factor may prove to be a diagnostic biomarker for ectopic pregnancy because it was shown to be undetectable in ectopic and nonviable pregnancies. C-reactive protein is an acute-phase reactant that increases with trauma or infection. Levels of this protein are lower in patients with ectopic pregnancy than in patients with an acute infectious process. When an infectious process is part of the differential diagnosis, measurement of C-reactive protein may be beneficial (135)."

            "content": "Historically, prenatal screening involved maternal serum screening for \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP), a protein secreted during fetal life by the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and yolk sac. Some of the AFP crosses the placenta and enters the maternal circulation. Although maternal serum screening was initially used to detect high levels of AFP associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) and the disruption of fetal integument such as omphalocele or gastroschisis, low levels of AFP were found to be associated with fetal aneuploidy. Approximately 50% of fetuses with autosomal trisomies (Down syndrome, trisomy 18, trisomy 13) will be detected by low maternal serum AFP levels. Three other proteins\u2014unconjugated estriol (uE3),inhibin A, and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)\u2014were added to the maternal serum screening to create the quad screen. The addition of these compounds increased the detection rate to about 80%."

            "content": "Second-trimester elevation of either hCG or dimeric inhibin alpha levels also shows signiicant association with adverse pregnancy outcomes. he outcomes reported are similar to those associated with MSAFP level elevation. Moreover, the likelihood of adverse outcome is augmented when levels of several markers are elevated (Dugof, 2005). Many of these complications are assumed to result from placental damage or dysfunction. However, the sensitivity and positive-predictive values of these markers are considered too low to be useful for screening or management. No speciic program of maternal or fetal surveillance has been found to favorably afect pregnancy outcomes (Dugof, 2010). At Parkland Hospital, prenatal care for these women is not altered unless a specific complication arises. Despite the extensive list of possible adverse outcomes, it is reassuring that most women with unexplained elevation of these analytes have normal outcomes."

Approximately 98 percent of pregnancies with an MSAFP level exceeding 2.5 MoM have an etiology other than a neural-tube defect. hus, counseling is indicated not only to inform the patient about the beneits and limitations of targeted sonography for the diagnosis of neural-tube defects but also to review the numerous other conditions. Some of these include fetal anomalies, placental abnormalities, and adverse outcomes associated with MSAFP level elevation (see Table 14-6). he likelihood of one of these abnormalities or of an adverse pregnancy outcome in the absence of a recognized abnormality rises in proportion to the AFP level. Adverse outcomes include fetal-growth restriction, preeclampsia, preterm birth, fetal demise, and stillbirth. More than 40 percent of pregnancies may be abnormal if the MSAFP level is greater than 7 MoM (Reichler, 1994)."

Because the incidence of congenital cardiac anomalies is fivefold in mothers with diabetes, fetal echocardiography is an important part of second-trimester sonographic evaluation (Fouda, 2013). Despite advances in ultrasound technology, however, Dashe and associates (2009) cautioned that detection of fetal anomalies in obese diabetic women is more diicult than in similarly sized women without diabetes."
