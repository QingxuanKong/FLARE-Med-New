They caution that the arm on which the cuff is placed must be held horizontally when standing, so that the decline in arm pressure will not be obscured by the added hydrostatic pressure. As emphasized in Chap. 17 on syncope, the determination of blood pressure in orthostatic testing is ideally done by having the patient remain supine for as long as it is practical before testing, and shifting from a supine to standing position, without the interposition of sitting.

Even more often, spirometry is used to measure airflow, which reflects the dynamic properties of the lung. During an FVC maneuver, the patient inhales to TLC and then exhales rapidly and forcefully to RV; this method ensures that flow limitation has been achieved, so that the precise effort made has little influence on actual flow. The total amount of air exhaled is the FVC, and the amount of air exhaled in the first second is the FEV1; the FEV1 is a flow rate, revealing volume change per time. Like lung volumes, an individual\u2019s maximal expiratory flows should be compared with predicted values based on height, age, and sex.

For example, it has been argued that when an individual is standing, the force of gravity impedes venous return to the heart from the dependent regions of the body. This explanation is incomplete because it does not account for the gravitational counterforce on the arterial side of the same vascular circuit, and this counterforce facilitates venous return. Moreover, it does not account for the effect of gravity in causing venous pooling. When a person is standing upright, gravity causes blood to accumulate in the lower extremities and distend both the arteries and veins. Because venous compliance is so much greater than arterial compliance, this distention occurs more on the venous side than on the arterial side of the circuit."

In the usual vasodepressor faint of adolescents\u2014which tends to occur in circumstances favoring vasodilatation (warm environment, hunger, fatigue, alcohol intoxication) and periods of emotional excitement\u2014it is enough to advise the patient to avoid such circumstances and to maintain adequate hydration. In postural hypotension, patients should be cautioned against arising suddenly from bed. Instead, they should first exercise the legs for a few seconds, then sit on the edge of the bed and make sure they are not light-headed or dizzy before starting to walk. Standing for prolonged periods can sometimes be tolerated without fainting by crossing the legs forcefully. The same regimen suffices for cases of syncope from deconditioning. Alternatives should be found for medications that are conceivable causes of orthostasis. \u03b2-Adrenergic blocking agents, diuretics, antidepressants, and sympatholytic antihypertensive drugs are the"

This gradient favors the flow of gastric juice up into the thoracic esophagus when upright. The gradi-ent diminishes in the supine position. Third, the LES pressure in normal subjects is significantly higher in the supine posi-tion than in the upright position. This is due to the apposition of the hydrostatic pressure of the abdomen to the abdominal portion of the sphincter when supine. In the upright position, the abdominal pressure surrounding the sphincter is negative compared with atmospheric pressure, and, as expected, the abdominal pressure gradually increases the more caudally it is measured. This pressure gradient tends to move the gastric con-tents toward the cardia and encourages the occurrence of reflux into the esophagus when the individual is upright. In contrast, in the supine position, the gastroesophageal pressure gradient diminishes, and the"

The flow pattern in the common carotid artery resembles that in the internal carotid artery, as 80% of the flow is directed to the internal carotid artery, with waveforms that have broad systolic peaks and mod-erate amount of flow during diastole. Conventionally, velocity measurements are recorded in the common, external, carotid bulb, and the proximal, mid, and distal portions of the internal carotid artery. Characteristically, the peak systolic velocity is increased at the site of the vessel stenosis. The end-diastolic velocity is increased with greater degree of stenosis. In addition, stenosis of the internal carotid artery can lead to color shifts with color mosaics indicating a poststenotic turbulence. Dampening of the Doppler velocity waveforms is typically seen in areas distal to severe carotid stenosis where blood flow is reduced. It is well known that occlusion of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery can lead to a \u201cfalsely\u201d"
