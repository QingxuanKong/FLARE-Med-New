A. The primary innate effector cells are neutrophils, which are recruited by CXCL8 and CXCL2 and have an increased output due to G-CSF and GM-CSF B. At homeostasis, TH17 cells are present almost exclusively in the intestinal mucosa C. IL-17 is the central cytokine D. IL-22 is produced to induce antimicrobial peptide production and epithelial cell proliferation and shedding of natural killer cells"

            "content": "PATHOGENESIS, PATHOLOGY, AND IMMuNE RESPONSE On agar media and in the soil, Coccidioides organisms exist as filamentous molds. Within this mycelial structure, individual filaments (hyphae) elongate and branch, some growing upward. Alternating cells within the hyphae degenerate, leaving barrel-shaped viable elements called arthroconidia. Measuring \u223c2 by 5 \u03bcm, arthroconidia may become airborne for extended periods. Their small size allows them to evade initial mechanical mucosal defenses and reach deep into the bronchial tree, where infection is initiated in the nonimmune host."

Most of the important pathogenic fungi exhibit dimorphism\u2014the ability to grow in either yeast or mold form. The yeast-to-mold or mold-to-yeast transition is frequently associated with infection."

Large lipid droplets are emulsified (have their surface area increased) in the mouth through the act of chewing (mastication). B. The enzyme colipase facilitates the binding of bile salts to mixed micelles, maximizing the activity of pancreatic lipase. C. The peptide hormone secretin causes the gallbladder to contract and release bile. D. Patients with cystic fibrosis have difficulties with digestion because their pancreatic secretions are less able to reach the small intestine, the primary site of lipid digestion. E. Formation of triacylglycerol-rich chylomicrons is independent of protein synthesis in the intestinal mucosa."
