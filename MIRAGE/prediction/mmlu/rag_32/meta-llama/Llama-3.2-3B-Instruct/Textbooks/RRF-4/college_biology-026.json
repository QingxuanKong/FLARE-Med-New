    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the given information and the options provided. We need to determine why the genes that allow the host bird species to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings remain in the gene pool of the population. Let's evaluate each option in the context of evolutionary biology and the concept of genetic adaptation.\\n\\nOption A: This option suggests that the host birds' response allows them to rear their own young efficiently, which would not necessarily lead to the retention of genes that allow them to be duped by cuckoo fledglings. In fact, this would be advantageous for the host birds, not the cuckoo.\\n\\nOption B: This option states that the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species. However, this is not necessarily true. The duped bird's energy and resources are being diverted from rearing its own young, which could compromise its fitness.\\n\\nOption C: This option suggests that on average, little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, whether it is an interloper or one's own. This option is plausible, as the energy spent on rearing a cuckoo fledgling might be similar to the energy spent on rearing one's own young, and the host bird might not notice the difference. This could lead to the retention of genes that allow the host bird to be duped by cuckoo fledglings.\\n\\nOption D: This option states that the maximum fitness of the cuckoo would then be reduced. However, the cuckoo's fitness is not directly affected by the host bird's reproductive success. The cuckoo's fitness is determined by its ability to successfully lay eggs and ensure the survival of its offspring, which is not dependent on the host bird's behavior.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the most plausible explanation is that the genes that allow the host bird species to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings remain in the gene pool of the population because on average, little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, whether it is an interloper or one's own.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

A VSG gene is expressed by being placed into the active expression site in the parasite genome. Only one VSG gene is expressed at a time, and it can be changed by a gene rearrangement that places a new VSG gene into the expression site (Fig. 13.21).

This strain was designated H1N1, referring to the specific forms of its main antigens, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Changes in the virus, rendering it less virulent, and the rise of adaptive immunity in the human population, prevented the pandemic from continuing in subsequent seasons, although H1N1 influenza strains continued to cause serious disease every year in very young and very old people.

Similarly, human influenza viruses spread readily to other humans, but have never been detected in birds. The key to this specificity lies in the viral capsid protein, hemagglutinin, which binds to sialic acid residues on cell-surface glycoproteins, triggering virus entry into the cell (Movie 23.8). Hemagglutinin on human viruses recognizes sialic acid in a 2-6 linkage with galactose, whereas avian hemagglutinin recognizes sialic acid in a 2-3 linkage with galactose. Humans make carbohydrate chains that have only the 2-6 linkage between sialic acid and galactose; birds make only the 2-3 linkage; but pigs make carbohydrate chains with both linkages.

The ability of retroviruses to acquire and alter the structure and function of host cell sequences has revolutionized our understanding of molecular carcinogenesis. The viruses can insert into the germline genome of the host cell and behave as a transposable or movable genetic element. They can activate or inactivate genes near the site of integration into the genome. They can rapidly alter their own genome by recombination and mutation under selective environmental stimuli."

It is much more likely that, after the divergence of the cartilaginous fishes, some immunoglobulin loci became rearranged in the germline of various ancestors through activation of the RAG genes in germ cells, with the consequent inheritance of the rearranged loci by the offspring. In these species, the rearranged germline loci might confer some advantages, such as ensuring rapid responses to common pathogens by producing a preformed set of immunoglobulin chains. The IgM antibody isotype is thought to go back to the origins of adaptive immunity. It is the predominant form of immunoglobulin in cartilaginous"

Successful pathogens use different strategies to achieve these ends, and over millions of years of coevolution with their hosts have evolved a remarkable diversity of strategies for avoiding detection and destruction by the immune system, often employing several strategies that subvert immunity at multiple points. The antiimmune strategies employed by pathogens are as sophisticated as the immune system itself. They must be for any pathogens to achieve success against the diverse strategies that vertebrates have evolved to ensure host protection."

            "content": "Mobile genetic elements are often considered to be molecular parasites (they are also termed \u201cselfish DNA\u201d) that persist because cells cannot get rid of them; they certainly have come close to overrunning our own genome. However, mobile DNA elements can provide benefits to the cell. For example, the genes they carry are sometimes advantageous, as in the case of antibiotic resistance in bacterial cells, discussed below. The movement of mobile genetic elements also produces many of the genetic variants upon which evolution depends, because, in addition to moving themselves, mobile genetic elements occasionally rearrange neighboring sequences of the host genome. Thus, spontaneous mutations observed in Drosophila, humans, and other organisms are often due to the movement of mobile genetic elements. While many of these mutations will be deleterious to the organism, some will be advantageous and may spread throughout the population. It is almost certain that much of the variety of life we"

B. Fruitflies and mosquitoes exhibit diversity in the secreted Dscam protein by alternative splicing of a vast array of different exons, while freshwater snails exhibit diversity in FREP genes by differential accumulation of genomic mutations in these genes. C. Jawless fish recombine VLR genes during DNA replication to engender diversity in these genes, which are expressed on lymphocytes and have GPI-anchored and secreted forms. D. RAG-1 arose from transposases while the RSSs it recognizes arose from terminal repeats from DNA transposons. E. MHC class I and class II genes arose before T cells and immunoglobulins in cartilaginous fish. General references."
