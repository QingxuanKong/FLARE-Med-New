Over the summer, he has been given a packet of sheet music to be proficient in by fall semester. David is a perfectionist when it comes to his craft. He always compares himself to better players, and is very hard on himself when he cannot master a section of one of his pieces. Which of the following answers best describes David?",

        "A": "Low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control",
        "B": "High self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control",

        "D": "Low self-esteem, low self-efficacy, internal locus of control"

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the characteristics of David's behavior and match them with the given options. David is a perfectionist who compares himself to better players and is hard on himself when he cannot master a section of his pieces. This behavior is indicative of low self-esteem, as he is overly critical of himself. He also seems to have a strong sense of self-efficacy, as he is willing to take on a challenging task (mastering a new piece of music) and is motivated to improve. However, his locus of control is likely external, as he is influenced by his comparisons to others and feels pressure to perform well. With this analysis, we can match David's characteristics with the given options and choose the correct answer.\" \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",

Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

Chess has an objective ranking system based on skill and performance criteria. Athletics, similarly, have ranking systems to distinguish novices from Olympians. But in medicine, after physicians complete training and pass the boards, no further tests or benchmarks identify those who have attained the highest levels of clinical performance. Of course, physicians often consult a few \u201celite\u201d clinicians for their \u201cspecial problem-solving prowess\u201d when particularly difficult or obscure cases have baffled everyone else. Yet despite their skill, even master clinicians typically cannot explain their exact processes and methods, thereby limiting the acquisition and dissemination of the expertise used to achieve their impressive results.

This operation was pioneered by Charles McBurney at the New York College of Physicians and Surgeons, among others.3 McBurney\u2019s classic report on early operative intervention for appendicitis was pre-sented before the New York Surgical Society in 1889. Appen-dectomy for the treatment of appendicitis, previously an often fatal disease, was popularized after the 1902 coronation of King Edward VII of England was delayed due to his falling ill with appendicitis. Edward insisted on carrying out his sched-ule, despite worsening abdominal pain. Sir Frederick Treves, a prominent London surgeon, was among the consultants in atten-dance upon Edward. As the prince\u2019s condition deteriorated, and as he continued to insist that he would go to Westminster Abbey to be crowned, Treves told him, \u201cThen Sire, you will go as a corpse.\u201d Edward relented, Treves drained a large periappendi-ceal abscess, and the king lived.4During the 20th century the"

They point out that in primitive peoples, language consisted of gestures and the utterance of simple sounds expressing emotion and that, over periods of time, movements and sounds became the conventional signs and verbal symbols of objects. Later these sounds came to designate the abstract qualities of objects. Historically, signs and spoken language were the first means of human communication; graphic records appeared much later. Native Americans, for instance, never reached the level of syllabic written language. Writing commenced as pictorial representation and only much later in human evolution were alphabets devised. The reading and writing of words are comparatively late achievements. For further details concerning communicative and cognitive abilities and methods of assessment, the reader may consult the monograph by Minifie and Lloyd."

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"
