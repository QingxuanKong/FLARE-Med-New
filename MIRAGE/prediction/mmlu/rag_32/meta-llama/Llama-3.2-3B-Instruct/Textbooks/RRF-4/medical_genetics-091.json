Consanguinity refers to the practice of marrying within the family or between close relatives. This is often associated with an increased risk of genetic disorders. In the context of genetic disorders, consanguinity is particularly linked to autosomal recessive inheritance patterns. This is because autosomal recessive disorders require two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to manifest the disease. When two carriers of the same mutated gene (who are related) have children, there is a higher chance that their offspring will inherit two copies of the mutated gene, leading to the manifestation of the disease. This is in contrast to autosomal dominant disorders, where only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to express the disease. X-linked disorders, on the other hand, are influenced by the X chromosome and are not directly related to consanguinity. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Autosomal recessive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

They occur when both of the alleles at a given gene locus are mutants. Therefore, such disorders are characterized by the following features: (1) The trait does not usually affect the parents, who are carriers of one diseased allele, but multiple siblings may show the disease; (2) siblings have one chance in four of being affected (i.e., the recurrence risk is 25% for each birth); and (3) if the mutant gene occurs with a low frequency in the population, there is a strong likelihood that the affected patient (the proband) is the product of a consanguineous marriage. They make up the largest group of mendelian disorders. In contrast with the features of autosomal dominant diseases, the following features generally apply to most autosomal recessive disorders: The expression of the defect tends to be more uniform than in autosomal dominant disorders."

When alleles at a given locus are identical, the individual is homozygous. Inheriting identical copies of a mutant allele occurs in many autosomal recessive disorders, particularly in circumstances of consanguinity or isolated populations. If the alleles are different on the maternal and the paternal copy of the gene, the individual is heterozygous at this locus (Fig. 82-10). If two different mutant alleles are inherited at a given locus, the individual is said to be a compound heterozygote. Hemizygous is used to describe males with a mutation in an X chromosomal gene or a female with a loss of one X chromosomal locus."

First-degree relatives share half of their genes, second-degree relatives share a fourth, and third-degree relatives-first cousins-share one eighth.

Certain racial, ethnic, or religious backgrounds may indicate elevated risk for specific recessive disorders. Although most women can provide some information regarding their history, their understanding may be limited. For example, several studies have shown that pregnant women often fail to report a birth defect in the family or they report it incorrectly. hus, any disclosed defect or genetic disease should be conirmed by reviewing pertinent medical records or by contacting afected relatives for additional information."

Koller and Davenport made the observation that young patients usually inherit the disease from their fathers and older patients from their mothers. It has been observed beginning at almost the same age in identical twins."
