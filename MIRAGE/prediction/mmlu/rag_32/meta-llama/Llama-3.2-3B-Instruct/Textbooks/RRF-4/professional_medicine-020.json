    "question": "A 52-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 1-week history of low-grade fever and increasing abdominal cramps that are exacerbated by bowel movements. She began a course of amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole 2 days ago but has had no relief of her symptoms. She has had intermittent constipation for the past 12 years. She has not had nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or bloody stools. She has a 3-year history of hypertension. She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 5 years ago because of leiomyomata uteri. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2 . Her temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant with guarding but no rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The stool is brown, and test for occult blood is negative. Her hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 15,000/mm3 , and platelet count is 280,000/mm3 ; serum studies and urinalysis show no abnormalities.

She has a history of intermittent constipation, and the symptoms began after starting a course of amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole. The patient has a history of hypertension and underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 5 years ago. The physical examination reveals tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant with guarding but no rebound. The patient\\u2019s stool is brown, and the test for occult blood is negative. The laboratory results show a normal hemoglobin concentration, leukocyte count, and platelet count. Given the patient\\u2019s symptoms and history, the differential diagnosis should include gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or infectious colitis. The patient\\u2019s symptoms of abdominal cramps and fever that are exacerbated by bowel movements are suggestive of IBD. The fact that the patient has a history of constipation and underwent a hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy does not rule out IBD, as IBD can affect any age group and sex. The negative test for occult blood in the stool makes bleeding less likely. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to perform a pelvic ultrasonography to evaluate for signs of IBD, such as thickened bowel wall, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, or free fluid in the pelvis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Evaluation of the pelvis may be difficult because of pain and guarding, but lack of a discrete mass or masses differentiates acute salpingooophoritis from tubo-ovarian abscess or torsion.

Bowel sounds are hypoactive and are substantially decreased with peritonitis related to a ruptured diverticular abscess.

Abdominal and bimanual rectovaginal examinations may reveal a poorly mobile, doughy in\ufb02ammatory mass in the left lower quadrant. Leukocytosis and fever are common.

Frequently, the findings before rupture and hemorrhage are nonspecific, and vital signs are normal. The abdomen may be nontender or mildly tender, with or without rebound. The uterus may be slightly enlarged, with findings similar to a normal pregnancy (103,104). Cervical motion tenderness may or may not be present. An adnexal mass may be palpable in up to 50% of cases, but the mass varies markedly in size, consistency, and tenderness. A palpable mass may be the corpus luteum and not the ectopic pregnancy. With rupture and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, the patient develops tachycardia followed by hypotension. Bowel sounds are decreased or absent. The abdomen is distended, with marked tenderness and rebound tenderness. Cervical motion tenderness is present. Frequently, the findings of the pelvic examination are inadequate because of pain and guarding."

Her head should be leaned back and supported gently by a pillow so that she does not tense her abdominal muscles. Flexion of the knees may facilitate relaxation. The abdomen should be inspected for signs of an intra-abdominal mass, organomegaly, or distention that would, for example, suggest ascites or intestinal obstruction. Auscultation of bowel sounds, if deemed necessary to ascertain the nature of the bowel sounds, should precede palpation. The frequency of intestinal sounds and their quality should be noted. In a patient with intestinal obstruction, \u201crushes,\u201d as well as the occasional high-pitched sound, can be heard. Bowel sounds associated with an ileus may occur less frequently but at the same pitch as normal bowel sounds."

The pain is similar to labor, with suprapubic cramping, and may be accompanied by lumbosacral backache, pain radiating down the anterior thigh, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and rarely syncopal episodes. The pain of dysmenorrhea is colicky in nature and, unlike abdominal pain that is caused by chemical or infectious peritonitis, is relieved by abdominal massage, counter-pressure, or movement of the body. On examination, the vital signs are normal. The suprapubic region may be tender to palpation. Bowel sounds are normal, and there is no upper abdominal tenderness and no abdominal rebound tenderness. Bimanual examination at the time of the dysmenorrheic episode often reveals uterine tenderness; severe pain does not occur with movement of the cervix or palpation of the adnexal structures. The pelvic organs are normal in primary dysmenorrhea."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

Laboratory evaluation of patients with known or suspected heart disease should include a blood count and serum chemistry analysis. Patients with heart disease tolerate anemia poorly. Serum sodium and potassium levels are particularly important in patients taking diuretics and digitalis. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine values provide information on renal function and hydration status. Assessment of blood glucose levels may detect undiagnosed DM. Chest radiography and electrocardiography are mandatory as part of the preoperative evaluation, and the results may be particularly helpful when compared with those of previous studies."

She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Pain history should include how and when the pain started, pregnancy-related symptoms (amenorrhea, irregular bleeding, nausea, breast tenderness), GI symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, obstipation, absence of \ufb02atus, hematochezia), urinary symptoms (dysuria, urgency frequency, hesitancy, hematuria), signs of infection (fever, chills, purulent vaginal discharge), and symptoms attributable to a hemoperitoneum (orthostasis, abdominal distention, and right upper quadrant or shoulder pain).

The symptoms and signs are similar to those of acute salpingitis. A ruptured tubo-ovarian abscess is a life-threatening surgical emergency because gram-negative endotoxic shock can develop rapidly. Vital signs reveal fever, tachycardia, and low blood pressure if the patient is septic. Tuboovarian abscesses can often be palpated on bimanual examination as firm, exquisitely tender, bilateral fixed masses. The abscesses can be palpated or \u201cpoint\u201d in the pelvic cul-de-sac and are appreciated on rectovaginal examination. Approximately 90% of patients will have abdominal or pelvic pain and 60% to 80% will present with fever and/or leukocytosis (21)."
