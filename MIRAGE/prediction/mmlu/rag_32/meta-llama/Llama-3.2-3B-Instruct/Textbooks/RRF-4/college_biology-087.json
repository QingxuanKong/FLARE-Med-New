The question asks about the relationship between sexual dimorphism in primates and competition for resources or mates. 2. Document [1] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) mentions that in a hostile environment, survival is highest for species that have large numbers of offspring and short lifespan, whereas in a safe and abundant environment, survival is highest for those species that invest resources in a smaller number of offspring and a longer life. 3. However, this document does not directly address the relationship between sexual dimorphism and competition for resources or mates. 4. Document [16] (Title: Neurology_Adams) discusses the role of olfactory systems in sexual attraction and how humans can discriminate between a large number of odorants, but it does not address competition for resources. 5. Document [19] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) mentions that males and females differ in their sex chromosomes and that mammals have evolved a dosage compensation mechanism to equalize the dosage of X-chromosome gene products between males and females, but it does not discuss competition for resources or mates. 6. Document [20] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) discusses the factors that influence bone remodeling and osteoporosis, but it does not address the relationship between sexual dimorphism and competition for resources or mates. 7. Document [22] (Title: Neurology_Adams) discusses the role of the hypothalamus in sexual development and the differences in suprachiasmatic nucleus size between males and females, but it does not address competition for resources. 8. Document [23] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) mentions that the great majority of mutations that are not harmful are selectively neutral and can spread in a population, but it does not discuss competition for resources or mates. 9. Document [26] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) discusses the process of mutation and natural selection, but it does not address the relationship between sexual dimorphism and competition for resources or mates. 10.

However, Document [2] (Title: Immunology_Janeway) mentions that autoimmune diseases are more common in females than males and that some disorders (SLE and MS) show a high degree of sexual dimorphism.

Perhaps the clearest demonstration of this is found in inbred mouse strains that are prone to various types of autoimmune diseases. Mice of the NOD strain are very likely to get diabetes, with female mice becoming diabetic faster than males (Fig. 15.31). For reasons that are still unclear, many autoimmune diseases are more common in females than in males (see Fig. 15.37 below), with some disorders (SLE and MS) showing a high degree of sexual dimorphism. Autoimmune diseases in humans also have a genetic component. Some autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, run in families, suggesting a role for genetic susceptibility. Most convincingly, if one identical (monozygotic) twin is affected, the other twin is quite likely to be affected as well, whereas concordance of disease is much less in nonidentical (dizygotic) twins."

Mammals have evolved a dosage compensation mechanism to equalize the dosage of X-chromosome gene products between males and females. The correct ratio of X chromosome to auto-some (non-sex chromosome) gene products is carefully controlled, and mutations that interfere with this dosage compensation are generally lethal."

Why, for example, do we grow to be so much larger than a mouse? Even within a species, size can vary greatly; a Great Dane, for instance, can weigh over 40 times more than a Chihuahua (Figure 21\u201357). Three variables define the size of an organ or organism: the number of cells, the size of the cells, and the quantity of extracellular material per cell. Size differences can arise from changes in any of these factors (Figure 21\u201358). If we compare a mouse with a human, for example, we find that the difference lies chiefly in the number of cells, there being roughly 3000 times more cells in a human, corresponding to a body that is roughly 3000 times more massive. Wild and cultivated species of food plants, on the other hand, often differ in body size chiefly because of differences of cell size."

Although we lack a direct record of changes over time, scientists can reconstruct the process of genome evolution from detailed comparisons of the genomes of contemporary organisms. The basic organizing framework for comparative genomics is the phylogenetic tree. A simple example is the tree describing the divergence of humans from the great apes (Figure 4\u201363). The primary support for this tree comes from comparisons of gene or protein sequences. For example, comparisons between the sequences of human genes or proteins and those of the great apes typically reveal the fewest differences between human and chimpanzee and the most between human and orangutan."

As is true for other zoonotic infections where there has been insufficient time for pathogen and host to coevolve to an equilibrium that attenuates virulence, SIV is generally less pathogenic in its nonhuman primate host than is HIV in its human host.

At puberty the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes \u201cwake up\u201d and the gonads begin producing sex steroids, which in turn induce the sexually dimorphic changes in appearance and behavior associated with men and women. The reproductive life span of women is set by their ovarian reserve and degree of follicular development (see earlier) and ends at menopause, usually in the fifth decade of life. Loss of estrogen production by the ovaries has a clear clinical impact on many postmenopausal women.

During growth, the skeleton increases in size by linear growth and by apposition of new bone tissue on the outer surfaces of the cortex (Fig. 425-4). The latter process is called modeling, a process that also allows the long bones to adapt in shape to the stresses placed on them. Increased sex hormone production at puberty is required for skeletal maturation, which reaches maximum mass and density in early adulthood. It is around puberty that the sexual dimorphism in skeletal size becomes obvious, although true bone density remains similar between the sexes.

Studies by LeVay have suggested that the interstitial nucleus of the hypothalamus is smaller in homosexual males compared to heterosexual males, although the biologic evidence has been sharply challenged (Byne) and more research is needed to understand the implications of the reported association.

The close similarity between human and chimpanzee genes is mainly due to the short time that has been available for the accumulation of mutations in the two diverging lineages, rather than to functional constraints TRANSPOSONS nonrepetitive DNA that is"

Positions where the sequences differ by a single nucleotide substitution are boxed in green, and positions that differ by the addition or deletion of nucleotides are boxed in yellow. Note that, thanks to purifying selection, the coding sequence of the exon is much more conserved than is the adjacent intron sequence. based on radioisotope decay in the rock formations in which fossils are found. Because the fossil record has many gaps, however, precise divergence times between species are difficult to establish, even for species that leave good fossils with distinctive morphology."
