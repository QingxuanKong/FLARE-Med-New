The large muscle cell retains the many nuclei of the contributing cells. These nuclei lie just beneath the plasma membrane (Figure 16\u201331).

The appearance of striations in skeletal muscle is due to the highly organized arrangement of thick and thin filaments in the myofibrils of skeletal muscle fibers. The sarcomere is a contractile unit in skeletal muscle. Each sarcomere is approximately 2 \u00b5m in length at rest and is bounded by two Z lines. Sarcomeres are arranged in series along the length of the myofibril. Thin filaments, containing actin, extend from the Z line toward the center of the sarcomere. Thick filaments, containing myosin, are positioned in the center of the sarcomere and overlap the actin thin filaments. Muscle contraction results from the Ca++-dependent interaction of myosin and actin, in which myosin pulls the thin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere. 2."

Velocity of the myosin ATPase reaction determines the rate at which this enzyme is capable of breaking down ATP molecules during the contraction cycle. The metabolic profile indicates the capacity for ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation or glycolysis. Fibers characterized by oxidative metabolism contain large amounts of myoglobin and an increased number of mitochondria, with their constituent cytochrome electron transport complexes.

It has been suggested that both calponin and caldesmon may regulate the contractility of smooth muscle. (in part by inhibiting actomyosin ATPase activity). Most of the myoplasm is filled with thin filaments that are roughly aligned along the long axis of the cell. The myosin content of smooth muscle is only a fourth that of striated muscle.

Skeletal muscle is made up of myofibrils containing thousands of sarcomeres assembled from highly ordered arrays of actin and myosin II filaments, together with many accessory proteins. Muscle contraction is stimulated by calcium, which causes the actin-filament-associated protein tropomyosin to move, uncovering myosin binding sites and allowing the filaments to slide past one another.

Immediately upon arrival of the signal, the muscle cell needs to be able to contract very rapidly, with all the sarcomeres shortening simultaneously. Two major features of the muscle cell make extremely rapid contraction possible. First, as previously discussed, the individual myosin motor heads in each thick filament spend only a small fraction of the ATP cycle time bound to the filament and actively generating force, so many myosin heads can act in rapid succession on the same thin filament without interfering with one another. Second, a specialized membrane system relays the incoming signal rapidly throughout the entire cell. The signal from the nerve triggers an action potential in the muscle cell plasma membrane (discussed in Chapter 11), and this electrical excitation spreads swiftly"

Historically, these biophysical properties were well described before elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of contraction. They remain important ways of describing muscle function. When muscles contract, they generate force (often measured as tension or stress) and decrease in length. In examination of the biophysical properties of muscle, one of these parameters is usually held constant, and the other is measured after an experimental maneuver. Accordingly, an isometric contraction is one in which muscle length is held constant, and the force generated during the contraction is then measured. An isotonic contraction is one in which the force (or tone) is held constant, and the change in length of the muscle is then measured."

            "content": "Slow-twitch skeletal muscles are also characterized by a high oxidative capacity (see Table 12.1 ), which in combination with the low myosin ATPase activity contribute to the fatigue resistance of slow-twitch muscle fibers. The oxidative capacity of the fast-twitch muscle fiber ranges from relatively high (in muscle fibers expressing type IIa myosin heavy chain) to low (in muscle fibers expressing type IIb myosin heavy chains). The low oxidative capacity of fast type IIb muscle fibers, coupled with the high myosin ATPase activity, increases the susceptibility of these muscle fibers to fatigue. Humans, however, rarely express the type IIb myosin heavy chain. Type IIb myosins are expressed in small animals such as rabbit and rats. Motor units are generally composed of only one type of muscle fiber ( Table 12.2"

(A) Low-magnification electron micrograph of a longitudinal section through a skeletal muscle cell of a rabbit, showing the regular pattern of cross-striations. The cell contains many myofibrils aligned in parallel (see Figure 16\u201331). (B) Detail of the skeletal muscle shown in (A), showing portions of two adjacent myofibrils and the definition of a sarcomere (black arrow). (C) Schematic diagram of a single sarcomere, showing the origin of the dark and light bands seen in the electron micrographs. The Z discs, at each end of the sarcomere, are attachment sites for the plus ends of actin filaments (thin filaments); the M line, or midline, is the location of proteins that link adjacent myosin II filaments (thick filaments) to one another. (D) When the sarcomere contracts, the actin and myosin filaments slide past one another without shortening. (A and B, courtesy of Roger Craig.)"

            "content": "Myofibrils are composed of bundles of myofilaments. Myofilaments are the individual filamentous polymers of myosin II (thick filaments) and actin and its associated proteins (thin filaments). Myofilaments are the actual contractile elements of striated muscle. The bundles of myofilaments that make up the myofibril are surrounded by a welldeveloped smooth-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (sER), also called the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This reticulum forms a highly organized tubular network around the contractile elements in all striated muscle cells. Mitochondria and glycogen deposits are located between the myofibrils in association with the sER. Cross-striations are the principal histologic feature of striated muscle."

Skeletal muscle fibers (b, from a hamster) are giant cells with many nuclei and are formed by cell fusion. the other types of muscle cells are more conventional, generally having only a single nucleus. heart muscle cells (C, from a rat) resemble skeletal muscle fibers in that their actin and myosin filaments are aligned in very orderly arrays to form a series of contractile units called sarcomeres, so that the cells have a striated (striped) appearance. the arrows in (C) point to intercalated discs\u2014end-toend junctions between the heart muscle cells; skeletal muscle cells in long muscles are joined end-to-end in a similar way. Smooth muscle cells (d, from the urinary bladder of a guinea-pig) are so named because they do not appear striated; they belong to the connective-tissue family and are closely related to fibroblasts. note that the smooth muscle is"
