In brief, it relies on the total internal reflection of a beam of light from the surface of a gold-coated glass slide. As the light is reflected, some of its energy excites electrons in the gold coating and these excited electrons are affected by the electric field of any molecules binding to the surface of the glass coating. The more molecules that bind to the surface, the greater is the effect on the excited electrons, and this in turn affects the reflected light beam. The reflected light thus becomes a sensitive measure of the number of atoms bound to the gold surface of the slide."

The spin aligns along the strong magnetic field, but it can be changed to a misaligned, excited state in response to applied radiofrequency (RF) pulses of electromagnetic radiation. When the excited hydrogen nuclei return to their aligned state, they emit RF radiation, which can be measured and displayed as a spectrum. The nature of the emitted radiation depends on the environment of each hydrogen nucleus, and if one nucleus is excited, it influences the absorption and emission of radiation by other nuclei that lie close to it. It is consequently possible, by an ingenious elaboration of the basic NMR technique known as two-dimensional NMR, to distinguish the signals from hydrogen nuclei in different amino acid residues, and to identify and measure the small shifts in these signals that occur when these hydrogen nuclei lie close enough"

Is there anything in the data in Figure Q16\u20133B that tells you how many ATP molecules are hydrolyzed per step? 16\u201310 A mitochondrion 1 \u03bcm long can travel the 1 meter length of the axon from the spinal cord to the big toe in a day. The Olympic men\u2019s freestyle swimming record for 200 meters is 1.75 minutes. In terms of body lengths per day, who is moving faster: the mitochondrion or the Olympic record holder? (Assume that the swimmer is 2 meters tall.) 16\u201311 Cofilin preferentially binds to older actin filaments and promotes their disassembly. How does cofilin distinguish old filaments from new ones? 16\u201312 Why is it that intermediate filaments have identical ends and lack polarity, whereas actin filaments and microtubules have two distinct ends with a defined polarity? 16\u201313 How is the unidirectional motion of a lamellipodium maintained?"

            "content": "one joule (J) is the amount of energy required to move an object a distance of one meter against a force of one newton. This measure of energy is derived from the si units (syst\u00e8me internationale d\u2019Unit\u00e9s) universally employed by physical scientists. a second unit of energy, often used by cell biologists, is the kilocalorie (kcal); one calorie is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1\u00b0C. one kJ is equal to 0.239 kcal (1 kcal = 4.18 kJ). Figure 2\u20133 Schematic indicating how two macromolecules with complementary surfaces can bind tightly to one another through noncovalent interactions. noncovalent chemical bonds have less than 1/20 the strength of a covalent bond. They are able to produce tight binding only when many of them are formed simultaneously. although only electrostatic attractions are illustrated here, in reality all four noncovalent forces often contribute to holding two macromolecules together (Movie 2.1)."

(A watt is a joule per second.) Assume that hydrolysis of ATP yields 50 kJ/mole. 2\u201316 Does a Snickers\u2122 candy bar (65 g, 1360 kJ) provide enough energy to climb from Zermatt (elevation 1660 m) to the top of the Matterhorn (4478 m, Figure Q2\u20133), or might you need to stop at H\u00d6rnli Hut (3260 m) to eat another one? Imagine that you and your gear have a mass of 75 kg, and that all of your work is done against gravity (that is, you are just climbing straight up). Remember from your introductory physics course that where g is acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/sec2). One joule is 1 kg m2/sec2. What assumptions made here will greatly underestimate how much candy you need?"

Discuss the following problems. 9\u20133 The diagrams in Figure Q9\u20131 show the paths of light rays passing through a specimen with a dry lens and with an oilimmersion lens.
