    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To determine which abdominal region lies just distal to the sternum, we need to consider the boundaries of the abdominal regions as described in the provided documents. The abdomen can be divided into nine regions by a midclavicular sagittal plane on each side and by the subcostal and intertubercular planes, which pass through the body transversely. These planes separate the abdomen into three central regions (epigastric, umbilical, pubic) and three regions on each side (hypochondrium, flank, groin). The epigastric region is defined as the area between the umbilicus and the lower edge of the xiphoid process. This region is located anterior to the stomach and the liver. The hypochondriac region is defined as the area between the lower edge of the xiphoid process and the 9th costal cartilage. This region is located anterior to the liver and the spleen. The hypogastric region is defined as the area between the 9th and the 4th lumbar vertebrae. This region is located posterior to the abdominal cavity. The lumbar region is defined as the area between the 4th and the 5th lumbar vertebrae. This region is located posterior to the abdominal cavity. Since the epigastric region lies anterior to the sternum and the hypochondriac region lies between the lower edge of the xiphoid process and the 9th costal cartilage, which is distal to the sternum, we can conclude that the hypochondriac region is the abdominal region that lies just distal to the sternum.

Landmarks on the body\u2019s surface can be used to locate deep structures and to assess function by auscultation and percussion. How to count ribs Knowing how to count ribs is important because different ribs provide palpable landmarks for the positions of deeper structures. To determine the location of specific ribs, palpate the jugular notch at the superior extent of the manubrium of the sternum. Move down the sternum until a ridge is felt. This ridge is the sternal angle, which identifies the articulation between the manubrium of the sternum and the body of the sternum. The costal cartilage of rib II articulates with the sternum at this location. Identify rib II. Then continue counting the ribs, moving in a downward and lateral direction (Fig. 3.105).

Also, the angle between the body of the sternum and the manubrium may become slightly less acute. When the ribs are depressed, the sternum moves downward and backward. This \u201cpump handle\u201d movement changes the dimensions of the thorax in the anteroposterior direction (Fig. 3.35A). As well as the anterior ends of the ribs being lower than the posterior ends, the middles of the shafts tend to be lower than the two ends. When the shafts are elevated, the middles of the shafts move laterally. This \u201cbucket handle\u201d movement increases the lateral dimensions of the thorax (Fig. 3.35B).

This is because the manubrium normally angles posteriorly on the body of the sternum, forming a raised feature referred to as the sternal angle. This elevation marks the site of articulation of rib II with the sternum. Rib I is not palpable, because it lies inferior to the clavicle and is embedded in tissues at the base of the neck.

The sternal angle is used to find the position of rib II as a reference for counting ribs (because of the overlying clavicle, rib I is not palpable); separates the superior mediastinum from the inferior mediastinum and marks the position of the superior limit of the pericardium; marks where the arch of the aorta begins and ends; passes through the site where the superior vena cava penetrates the pericardium to enter the heart; is the level at which the trachea bifurcates into right and left main bronchi; and marks the superior limit of the pulmonary trunk. Venous shunts from left to right"

The top of this region is the iliac crest, which ends anteriorly as the anterior superior iliac spine and posteriorly as the posterior superior iliac spine. A prominent lateral expansion of the crest just posterior to the anterior superior iliac spine is the tuberculum of the iliac crest. The anterior inferior iliac spine is on the anterior margin of the ilium, and below this, where the ilium fuses with the pubis, is a raised area of bone (the iliopubic eminence). The gluteal surface of the ilium faces posterolaterally and lies below the iliac crest. It is marked by three curved lines (inferior, anterior, and posterior gluteal lines), which divide the surface into four regions:"

            "content": "Because of the way in which the sacrum and attached pelvic bones are angled posteriorly on the vertebral column, the pelvic cavity is not oriented in the same vertical plane as the abdominal cavity. Instead, the pelvic cavity projects posteriorly, and the inlet opens anteriorly and somewhat superiorly (Fig. 4.10). The abdomen is separated from the thorax by the diaphragm. Structures pass between the two regions through or posterior to the diaphragm (see Fig. 4.8). The pelvic inlet opens directly into the abdomen and structures pass between the abdomen and pelvis through it. The peritoneum lining the abdominal cavity is continuous with the peritoneum in the pelvis. Consequently, the abdominal cavity is entirely continuous with the pelvic cavity (Fig. 4.11). Infections in one region can therefore freely spread into the other."

Abdominal viscera include: major elements of the gastrointestinal system\u2014the caudal end of the esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder; the spleen; components of the urinary system\u2014kidneys and ureters; the suprarenal glands; and major neurovascular structures. The abdomen houses major elements of the gastrointestinal system (Fig. 4.2), the spleen, and parts of the urinary system. Much of the liver, gallbladder, stomach, and spleen and parts of the colon are under the domes of the diaphragm, which project superiorly above the costal margin of the thoracic wall, and as a result these abdominal viscera are protected by the thoracic wall. The superior poles of the kidneys are deep to the lower ribs."

            "content": "The anterior intercostal arteries originate directly or indirectly as lateral branches from the internal thoracic arteries (Fig. 3.29). Each internal thoracic artery arises as a major branch of the subclavian artery in the neck. It passes anteriorly over the cervical dome of the pleura and descends vertically through the superior thoracic aperture and along the deep aspect of the anterior thoracic wall. On each side, the internal thoracic artery lies posterior to the costal cartilages of the upper six ribs and about 1 cm lateral to the sternum. At approximately the level of the sixth intercostal space, it divides into two terminal branches: the superior epigastric artery, which continues inferiorly into the anterior abdominal wall (Fig. 3.29); and the musculophrenic artery, which passes along the costal margin, goes through the diaphragm, and ends near the last intercostal space."
