Physical examination shows localized tenderness over the lumbar spine after movement. X-rays of the spine show a compression fracture of L1-2. A DEXA scan shows decreased bone mineral density. Serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations and serum alkaline phosphatase activity are within the reference ranges. A bisphosphonate drug is prescribed. The expected beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to which of the following actions?",

Bisphosphonates are a class of medications commonly used to treat osteoporosis by inhibiting bone resorption.\\n\\nThe mechanism of action of bisphosphonates involves the inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, which leads to an increase in bone density and a decrease in the risk of fractures.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate the options given in the question:\\nOption A: Decreased insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentration - IGF-1 is not directly related to the mechanism of action of bisphosphonates.\\nOption B: Decreased osteoclast activity - This is the correct answer. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, leading to a decrease in osteoclast activity.\\nOption C: Decreased osteoprotegerin production - Osteoprotegerin is a protein that inhibits osteoclast formation, but bisphosphonates do not primarily work by affecting osteoprotegerin production.\\nOption D: Increased 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol concentration - Bisphosphonates do not affect vitamin D metabolism or increase 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol levels.\\n\\nTherefore, the expected beneficial effect of bisphosphonates in this patient is the decrease in osteoclast activity, leading to an increase in bone density and a decrease in the risk of fractures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Height loss >2.5\u20133.8 cm (>1\u20131.5 in.) is an indication for VFA by DXA or radiography to rule out asymptomatic vertebral fractures, as is the presence of significant kyphosis or back pain, particularly if it began after menopause.

Thus, a 60-year-old woman with a Z-score of \u20131 (1 SD below mean for age) has a T-score of \u20132.5 (2.5 SD below mean for a young control group) (Fig. 425-6). A T-score below \u20132.5 in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip has been defined as a diagnosis of osteoporosis. As noted above, because more than 50% of fractures occur in individuals with low bone mass rather than BMD osteoporosis, attempts are ongoing to redefine the disease as a fracture risk rather than a specific BMD. Consistent with this concept, fractures of the spine and hip that occur in the absence of major trauma would be considered to be sufficient to diagnose osteoporosis, regardless of BMD. Fractures of other sites, such as pelvis, proximal humerus, and wrist, would be tantamount to an osteoporosis diagnosis in the presence of low BMD. CT can also be used to measure the spine"

Outcome measures were taken at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and included the following assessments: bone mineral density at third lumbar vertebrae, serum levels of osteocalcin, total alkaline phosphatase, and urinary ratios of calcium/creatinine and hydroxyproline/creatinine. The findings revealed decreased bone mineral density in the vitamin D and calcium groups and no decrease in the conjugated estrogen and E3 groups. Osteocalcin and alkaline phosphate was decreased or without change in the conjugated estrogen and E3 groups, and was increased in the vitamin D3 and calcium groups. Urinary calcium/creatinine ratios were decreased with E3 and conjugated estrogen, and there was no decrease with the use of vitamin D3 and calcium. Urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratios were"

The child typically holds the spine in a straight or stiff position, generally has a loss of lumbar lordosis due to paravertebral muscular spasm, and refuses to flex the lumbar spine. The white blood cell count is normal or elevated, but the ESR and CRP are usually high. Radiographic findings vary according to the duration of symptoms before diagnosis. Anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique radiographs of the lumbar or thoracic spine will typically show a narrow disk space with irregularity of the adjacent vertebral body end plates. In early cases, bone scan or MRI may be helpful, because they will be positive before findings are noticeable on plain radiographs. MRI can also be used to differentiate between diskitis and the more serious condition of vertebral osteomyelitis."

Dorsal kyphosis in conjunction with elongation of the ribs contributes to the development of the barrel chest seen in acromegalic patients. The hands and feet become enlarged as a result of soft tissue proliferation. The fingers are thickened and have spadelike distal tufts. One-third of patients have a thickened heel pad.

High levels of cytokines from the chronic inflammation activate osteoclasts. Glucocorticoids increase urinary losses of calcium, suppress bone formation, and inhibit intestinal calcium absorption as well as decreasing gonadotropin production, leading to hypogonadism. Man-agement should include measurement of serum testoster-one, calcium, 25(OH)D, and the 24-hour urine calcium and creatinine levels (to verify completeness of collection), with treatment as appropriate for these secondary causes, plus initiation of bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy as primary treatment."

There is no long-term experience regarding specific clinical outcomes such as fracture prevention, but it has been established that bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density significantly without changing serum calcium (as does estrogen, but the latter is not favored because of reported adverse effects in other organ systems). Calcimimetics that lower PTH secretion lower calcium but do not affect bone mineral density."
