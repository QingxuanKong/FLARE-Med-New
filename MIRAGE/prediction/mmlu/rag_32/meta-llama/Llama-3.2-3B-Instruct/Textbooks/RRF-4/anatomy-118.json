The right atrioventricular (AV) valve, also known as the tricuspid valve, is one of the four valves in the heart that regulates blood flow between the atria and ventricles. The question asks about the function of the right atrioventricular valve, which is a critical aspect of heart function. Let's evaluate each option given in the context of the provided documents.\\n\\nOption A: is a semilunar valve. This statement is incorrect because the tricuspid valve is actually an atrioventricular valve, not a semilunar valve. Semilunar valves are found in the pulmonary and aortic valves, which are located between the ventricles and the great arteries.\\n\\nOption B: is prevented from everting by papillary muscles. This statement is incorrect because the tricuspid valve is prevented from everting by the chordae tendineae, which are fibrous strings that attach to the valve leaflets and prevent them from closing completely.\\n\\nOption C: is open during systole. This statement is correct. The tricuspid valve is open during systole, allowing blood to flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. During diastole, the valve closes, preventing backflow into the atrium.\\n\\nOption D: prevents blood returning from the pulmonary trunk as the heart relaxes. This statement is incorrect because the tricuspid valve does not prevent blood from returning from the pulmonary trunk. The pulmonary trunk is actually a part of the right ventricle and is not directly related to the tricuspid valve.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is Option C: is open during systole.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

The cardiac skeleton is a collection of dense, fibrous connective tissue in the form of four rings with interconnecting areas in a plane between the atria and the ventricles. The four rings of the cardiac skeleton surround the two atrioventricular orifices, the aortic orifice and opening of the pulmonary trunks. They are the anulus fibrosus. The interconnecting areas include: the right fibrous trigone, which is a thickened area of connective tissue between the aortic ring and right atrioventricular ring; and the left fibrous trigone, which is a thickened area of connective tissue between the aortic ring and the left atrioventricular ring (Fig. 3.76)."

The left atrioventricular orifice opens into the posterior right side of the superior part of the left ventricle. It is closed during ventricular contraction by the mitral valve (left atrioventricular valve), which is also referred to as the bicuspid valve because it has two cusps, the anterior and posterior cusps (Fig. 3.74). The bases of the cusps are secured to a fibrous ring surrounding the opening, and the cusps are continuous with each other at the commissures.

The excitation signals generated by the sinu-atrial node spread across the atria, causing the muscle to contract. Concurrently, the wave of excitation in the atria stimulates the atrioventricular node, which is located near the opening of the coronary sinus, close to the attachment of the septal cusp of the tricuspid valve, and within the atrioventricular septum (Fig. 3.83A). The atrioventricular node is a collection of specialized cells that forms the beginning of an elaborate system of conducting tissue, the atrioventricular bundle, which extends the excitatory impulse to all ventricular musculature. The atrioventricular bundle is a direct continuation of the atrioventricular node (Fig. 3.83A). It follows along the lower border of the membranous part of the interventricular septum before splitting into right and left bundles."

Intraventricular surgery may also result in electrophysiologic consequences, including complete heart block necessitating pacemaker insertion to avoid sudden death. Valvular problems may arise late after initial cardiac operation. An example is the progressive stenosis of an initially nonobstructive bicuspid aortic valve in the patient who underwent aortic coarctation repair. Such aortic valves may also be the site of infective endocarditis. After repair of the ostium primum ASD, the cleft mitral valve may become progressively regurgitant.

The inteventricular septum is shown to be in continuity with the anterior wall of the aorta, and the mitral valve in continuity with the posterior wall of the aorta (see Fig. 10-28B). Ventricular septal defects and outflow tract abnormalities are often visible in this view (Fig. 10-29)."

The underlying etiology. Is the disease congenital, hypertensive, ischemic, or inflammatory in origin? Approach to the Patient with Possible Cardiovascular Disease No limitation of physical activity Marked limitation of physical activity No symptoms with ordinary Less than ordinary activity causes exertion symptoms Slight limitation of physical activity Class IV Ordinary activity causes symptoms Inability to carry out any physical activity without discomfort Source: Modified from The Criteria Committee of the New York Heart Association. 2. The anatomic abnormalities. Which chambers are involved? Are they hypertrophied, dilated, or both? Which valves are affected? Are they regurgitant and/or stenotic? Is there pericardial involvement? Has there been a myocardial infarction? 3."

However, implantation of an LVAD may cause acute worsening of tricuspid regurgitation and exacerbations of right heart failure through leftward deviation of the intraven-tricular septum and as a result of the significant volume-loading and transfusion requirement that is often necessary to achieve adequate flows postoperatively. Overall, approximately 20% of HeartMate II BTT patients had persistent right ventricular failure (RVF) requiring either a subsequent RVAD (6%) or intravenous inotropic support for >14 days (14%), and these patients had significantly worse 6-month survival compared to those without RVF (71% vs. 89%, P <0.001).236 Typically, mechanical right-ventricular support is temporary with"
