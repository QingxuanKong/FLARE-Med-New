We need to evaluate each option against these features.\\n\\nOption A, ankylosing spondylitis, typically presents with chronic back pain and stiffness, especially in the morning or after periods of inactivity, and is often accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and weight loss. While it can cause tenderness in the neck and shoulder region, the presence of multiple bilateral tender points in the trapezius, gluteal, and suboccipital muscle groups is not a characteristic feature of ankylosing spondylitis.\\n\\nOption B, fibromyalgia, is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and tender points, often accompanied by fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive dysfunction. The presence of multiple bilateral tender points in the trapezius, gluteal, and suboccipital muscle groups, as well as the symptoms of chronic achiness, stiffness, and fatigue, makes fibromyalgia a strong candidate for the diagnosis.\\n\\nOption C, myofascial pain syndrome, typically involves localized musculoskeletal pain and tenderness, often accompanied by trigger points and referred pain. While it can cause pain in the neck and shoulder region, the widespread nature of the tender points and the lack of specific trigger points described in the scenario make this option less likely.\\n\\nOption D, osteoarthritis, is characterized by joint pain and stiffness, particularly in the hands, knees, hips, and spine. The normal radiograph findings and lack of joint pain in the scenario make osteoarthritis an unlikely diagnosis.\\n\\nBased on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is fibromyalgia, as it is the condition that best matches the widespread nature of the tender points and the accompanying symptoms of chronic achiness, stiffness, and fatigue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

We have been unable to corroborate the ill-defined tender nodules or cords (trigger points) that have been reported as an essential element of this illness. Excision of such nodules has not revealed any sign of inflammation or other disease process. The currently fashionable terms myofascial pain syndrome, fibromyalgia, and fibrositis have been attached to the syndrome.

            "content": "The physical examination of patients with fatigue is guided by the history and differential diagnosis. A detailed mental status examination should be performed with particular attention to symptoms of depression and anxiety. A formal neurologic examination is required to determine whether objective muscle weakness is present. This is usually a straightforward exercise, although occasionally patients with fatigue have difficulty sustaining effort against resistance and sometimes report that generating full power requires substantial mental effort. On confrontational testing, they are able to generate full power for only a brief period before suddenly giving way to the examiner. This type of weakness is often referred to as breakaway weakness and may or may not be associated with pain. This is contrasted with weakness due to lesions in the motor tracts or lower motor unit, in which the patient\u2019s resistance can be overcome in a smooth and steady fashion and full power can never be"

Strength may also be graded on a 5-point scale: 0 for no movement; 1 for trace movement or twitch; 2 for movement with gravity eliminated; 3 for movement against gravity only; 4 for movement against gravity and resistance; and 5 for normal strength. The examiner should assess for often-overlooked nonarticular or periarticular involvement, especially when articular complaints are not supported by objective findings referable to the joint capsule. The identification of soft tissue/nonarticular pain will prevent unwarranted and often expensive additional evaluations. Specific maneuvers may reveal common nonarticular abnormalities, such as a carpal tunnel syndrome (which can be identified by Tinel\u2019s or Phalen\u2019s sign). Other examples of soft tissue abnormalities include olecranon bursitis, epicondylitis (e.g., tennis elbow), enthesitis (e.g., Achilles tendinitis), and tender trigger points associated with fibromyalgia."

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

            "content": "The physician is initially put on the track of a myopathic disease by eliciting complaints of muscle weakness or fatigue, pain, limpness or stiffness, spasm, cramp, twitching, or a muscle mass or change in muscle volume. Of these, the symptom of weakness is by far the most frequent and at the same time the most elusive. As remarked in Chap. 23, when speaking of weakness, the patient often means excessive fatigability and poor endurance. Although fatigability in the strict sense of gradually reduced power with ongoing use of a muscle may be a feature of muscle diseases, particularly those affecting the neuromuscular junction such as myasthenia gravis, it is far more frequently a complaint of patients with chronic systemic disease or with anxiety or depression. As stated in Chap. 23, fatigue is an abstruse symptom, always requiring analysis and interpretation. When not attended by manifest reduction in muscle power, it is usually nonmuscular in origin. It may, on medical investigation,"

            "content": "As the illness progresses, any noise or other sensory stimulus or attempted passive or voluntary movement may precipitate painful spasms of all the involved musculature. The tendon reflexes are normal if they can be tested. The affected muscles, particularly the lumbar paraspinals and glutei, are extremely taut when palpated and eventually they become hypertrophied. It is this axial spasm that is most characteristic of the disease and gives rise to a characteristic lumbar lordosis. We have experience with one unusual instance of this disease that caused the obverse, namely, flexion spasm of the abdominal musculature with a bent-over camptocormia."
