This represents a very basic technique that is widely used in almost all areas of biomedical research. DNA vectors often are called plasmids, which are extrachromosomal molecules of DNA that vary in size and can replicate and be transmitted from bacterial cell to cell. Plasmids can be propagated either in the cytoplasm or after insertion, as part of the bacterial chromosome in Escherichia coli. The process of molecular cloning involves several steps of manipulation of DNA. First, the vector plasmid DNA is cleaved with a restriction enzyme to create compatible ends with the foreign DNA fragment to be cloned.

For example, to determine the nucleotide sequence of the human genome, it was broken up into roughly 100,000-nucleotide-pair pieces, each of which was inserted into a BAC plasmid and amplified in E. coli. The resulting genomic library consisted of tens of thousands of bacterial colonies, each containing a different human DNA insert. The nucleotide sequence of each insert was determined separately and the sequence of the entire genome was stitched together from the pieces. The most important advantage of cDNA clones, over genomic clones, is that they contain the uninterrupted coding sequence of a gene. When the aim of the cloning, for example, is to produce the protein in large quantities by expressing the cloned gene in a bacterial or yeast cell, it is more preferable to start with cDNA."

They generally account for only a minor fraction of the total host bacterial cell DNA, but owing to their small size, they can easily be separated from the much larger chromosomal DNA molecules, which precipitate as a pellet upon centrifugation. For use as cloning vectors, the purified plasmid DNA circles are first cut with a restriction nuclease to create linear DNA molecules. The DNA to be cloned is added to the cut plasmid and then covalently joined using the enzyme DNA ligase (Figure 8\u201327 and Figure 8\u201328).

Translocation\u2014fluorescence signal that corresponds to one chromosome is found in a different chromosome (two white arrows in A show fragments of chromosome 17 that have translocated to chromosome 19). Duplication\u2014a second copy of a chromosome, resulting in a trisomy or tetrasomy (two blue arrows show duplicated chromosomes 8, resulting in a tetrasomy). Molecular cloning Production of a recombinant DNA molecule in a bacterial host. Steps: 1. Isolate eukaryotic mRNA (post-RNA processing) of interest. 2. Add reverse transcriptase (an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) to produce complementary DNA (cDNA, lacks introns). 3. Insert cDNA fragments into bacterial plasmids containing antibiotic resistance genes. 4. Transform (insert) recombinant plasmid into bacteria. 5. Surviving bacteria on antibiotic medium produce cloned DNA (copies of cDNA)."

            "content": "clonal selection theory The central paradigm of adaptive immunity. It states that adaptive immune responses derive from individual antigen-specific lymphocytes that are self-tolerant. These specific lymphocytes proliferate in response to antigen and differentiate into antigen-specific effector cells that eliminate the eliciting pathogen, and into memory cells to sustain immunity. The theory was formulated by Macfarlane Burnet and in earlier forms by Niels Jerne and David Talmage. clone A population of cells all derived from the same progenitor cell. clonotypic Describes a feature unique to members of a clone. For example, the distribution of antigen receptors in the lymphocyte population is said to be clonotypic, as the cells of a given clone all have identical antigen receptors. Clostridium difficile Gram-positive anaerobic toxogenic spore-forming bacterium frequently associated with severe colitis following treatment with certain broad-spectrum antibiotics."

            "content": "Genetic linkaGe Genetic linkage refers to the fact that genes are physically connected, or linked, to one another along the chromosomes. Two fundamental principles are essential for understanding the concept of linkage: (1) when two genes are close together on a chromosome, they are usually transmitted together, unless a recombination event separates them (Figs. 82-6); and (2) the odds of a crossover, or recombination event, between two linked genes is proportional to the distance that separates them. Thus, genes that are farther apart are more likely to undergo a recombination event than genes that are very close together. The detection of chromosomal loci that segregate with a disease by linkage can be used to identify the gene responsible for the disease (positional cloning) and to predict the odds of disease gene transmission in genetic counseling."
