The spleen is known to filter the blood and remove old or damaged red blood cells, making it a key component in the immune system. The spleen is also a reservoir for red blood cells, as it stores and recycles iron from old or damaged red blood cells. The other options, appendix, gallbladder, and pancreas, do not have these specific functions. The appendix is a small, finger-like pouch attached to the large intestine, the gallbladder stores bile, and the pancreas produces digestive enzymes.

It has no direct connection with the lymphatic system; instead, it collects antigen from the blood and is involved in immune responses to blood-borne pathogens. Lymphocytes enter and leave the spleen via blood vessels. The spleen also collects and disposes of senescent red blood cells. Its organization is shown schematically in Fig. 1.23.

Lymph nodes are interconnected by a system of lymphatic vessels, which drain extracellular fluid from tissues, carry it through the lymph nodes, and deposit it back into the blood."

(Figure 24\u201312) lymphoma Cancer of lymphocytes, in which the cancer cells are mainly found in lymphoid organs (rather than in the blood, as in leukemias). lysosomal storage diseases Genetic diseases resulting from defects in or a lack of one or more functional hydrolases in lysosomes of some cells, leading to accumulation of undigested substrates in lysosomes and consequent cell pathology. lysosome Membrane-enclosed organelle in eukaryotic cells containing digestive enzymes, which are typically most active at the acid pH found in the lumen of lysosomes. (Figure 13\u201337) lysozyme Enzyme that catalyzes the cutting of polysaccharide chains in the cell walls of bacteria."
