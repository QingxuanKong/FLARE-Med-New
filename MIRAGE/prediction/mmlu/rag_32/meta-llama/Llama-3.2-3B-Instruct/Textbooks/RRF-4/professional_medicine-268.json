    "question": "Four days after undergoing open reduction and internal fixation of a fracture of the right femur sustained in a motor vehicle collision, a 47-year-old man continues to have agitation and confusion despite treatment with haloperidol. He has mild hypertension. Other medications include acetaminophen, atenolol, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 168/98 mm Hg. During the examination, he is uncooperative and refuses to answer questions. Neurologic examination shows tremulousness and no focal findings. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. A CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking for the given question: Step 1: Review the patient's history and symptoms - The patient is a 47-year-old man who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of a fracture of the right femur 4 days ago. He is experiencing agitation, confusion, tremulousness, and is uncooperative. Step 2: Consider the patient's medications - The patient is taking haloperidol, acetaminophen, atenolol, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. Step 3: Evaluate the potential side effects of medications - Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication that can cause extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), such as tremulousness and confusion, especially in elderly patients. Step 4: Consider alternative causes of agitation and confusion - The patient's CT scan shows no abnormalities, and there is no indication of sepsis or fat emboli. Step 5: Consider the patient's history of trauma and potential for substance abuse - There is no indication of substance abuse in the patient's history. Conclusion: The most likely cause of the patient's agitation, confusion, tremulousness, and uncooperativeness is an adverse effect of the medication, specifically haloperidol. Here's the output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing agitation, confusion, tremulousness, and uncooperativeness 4 days after undergoing open reduction and internal fixation of a fracture of the right femur. The patient is taking haloperidol, which is an antipsychotic medication that can cause extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), such as tremulousness and confusion. The patient's symptoms are consistent with an adverse effect of haloperidol. Other potential causes, such as sepsis, fat emboli, or alcohol withdrawal, are not supported by the patient's history or physical examination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The risk of nonunion includes displacement greater than 5 mm, angulation greater than 10 degrees, age over 50 years, smoking, and delayed diagnosis more than 4 weeks. Nonunion occurs due to interruption of the blood supply. Trans-fixing the odontoid fracture with a screw maintains rotational movement. Posterior fusion of C1 on C2 is another option, but this results in decreased cervical spine rotation; 50% of rotation of the cervical spine comes from C1 and C2 joint.Type III fractures extend into the body of C2, below the origin of the odontoid process. The cancellous bone is rich in blood supply and usually heals well. Type III fractures are gen-erally treated with a halo brace.Hangman\u2019s Fractures of C2Hangman\u2019s Fractures are a bilateral fracture of the"

Past medical history included schizophrenia, for which he required institutional care; treatment had included neuroleptics and intermittent lithium, the latter restarted 6 months before admission. The patient was treated with antibiotics and intubated for several days, with the development of polyuria (3\u20135 L/d), hypernatremia, and acute renal insufficiency; the peak plasma Na+ concentration was 156 meq/L, and peak creatinine was 2.6 mg/dL. Urine osmolality was measured once and reported as 157 mOsm/kg, with a coincident plasma osmolality of 318 mOsm/kg. Lithium was stopped on admission to the ICU. On physical examination, the patient was alert, extubated, and thirsty. Weight was 97.5 kg. Urine output for the previous 24 h had been 3.4 L, with an IV intake of 2 L/d of D5W."

Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."
