    "question": "A hedonic teenager of wayward morals, in one night, sequentially i) has consensual sexual intercourse with his sister, ii) leaves no tip at the bar, iii) has non-censual sexual relations with an unknown woman, and iv) vomits on the steps to the door of a local church.

        "D": "taboo, folkways, the law, and mores"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's analyze the behaviors described in the scenario and match them to the options provided. The behaviors described are: i) having consensual sexual intercourse with his sister ii) leaving no tip at the bar iii) having non-consensual sexual relations with an unknown woman iv) vomiting on the steps to the door of a local church Now, let's match these behaviors to the options: - i) Having consensual sexual intercourse with his sister: This behavior violates societal norms and moral expectations (taboo). - ii) Leaving no tip at the bar: This behavior violates social norms and expectations related to etiquette and respect for others (folkways). - iii) Having non-consensual sexual relations with an unknown woman: This behavior violates both the law and societal norms and expectations related to consent and respect for others (taboo and the law). - iv) Vomiting on the steps to the door of a local church: This behavior is also a violation of societal norms and expectations related to respect for others and public decency (taboo). Given these observations, the correct answer should reflect the order in which the teenager has violated societal norms and expectations. The teenager has violated the law first (non-consensual sexual relations), then violated folkways (leaving no tip at the bar), followed by violating taboo (having consensual sexual intercourse with his sister and non-consensual sexual relations with an unknown woman), and finally violating moral expectations (vomiting on the steps to the door of a local church). Therefore, the correct answer is D. taboo, folkways, the law, and mores.",

Adolescence and puberty generally increase sexual curiosity and activity. To alleviate the risk of pathologizing normative sexual interest and behavior during pubertal adoles- cence, the minimum age for the diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder is 18 years (Criterion C). Voyeuristic acts are the most common of potentially law-breaking sexual behaviors. The population prevalence of voyeuristic disorder is unknown. However, based on voyeuris- tic sexual acts in nonclinical samples, the highest possible lifetime prevalence for voyeuris\u2014 tic disorder is approximately 12% in males and 4% in females."

Becoming comfortable with one\u2019s sexuality is one of the principal developmental tasks of this period and is likely to include questioning and experimentation. Almost half of high school students report that they have had sexual intercourse. Ten to 25% have at least one homosexual experience, with this behavior being reported more commonly by boys than girls. Although many adolescents have sexual experiences with a same-sex partner, only a few have a homosexual sexual orientation by late adolescence. When adolescents develop a consistent sexual orientation is probably affected by many different factors (societal, family, individual). Some adolescents report that they are certain of their sexual orientation in the early teenage years, whereas for others this does not develop until later. By 18 years of age, only a small proportion of individuals report being uncertain of their sexual orientation."

            "content": "The diagnostic criteria for voyeuristic disorder can apply both to individuals who more or less freely disclose this paraphilic interest and to those who categorically deny any sexual arousal from observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, disrobing, or engaged in sexual activity despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary. If disclosing individuals also report dis- tress or psychosocial problems because of their voyeuristic sexual preferences, they could be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder. On the other hand, if they declare no distress, demon- strated by lack of anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame, about these paraphilic impulses and are not impaired in other important areas of functioning because of this sexual interest, and their psychiatric or legal histories indicate that they do not act on it, they could be ascertained as having voyeuristic sexual interest but should not be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder."

Without being aware of it, they often act out a role (e.g., \u201dvictim\u201d or \u201dprincess\u201d) in their relationships to others. They may seek to control their partner through emotional manipulation or seductiveness on one level, while display- ing a marked dependency on them at another level. Individuals with this disorder often have impaired relationships with same\u2014sex friends because their sexually provocative inter- personal style may seem a threat to their friends\u2019 relationships. These individuals may also alienate friends with demands for constant attention. They often become depressed and up- set when they are not the center of attention. They may crave novelty, stimulation, and ex- citement and have a tendency to become bored with their usual routine.
