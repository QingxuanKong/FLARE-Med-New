First, let's consider option A: A painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure. This statement is true, as painful digital examination is commonly associated with anal fissures, according to Document [7] (Title: Pathology_Robbins) which states that sharp, knife-like pain and bright red rectal bleeding with bowel movements suggest the diagnosis of fissure. Next, let's consider option B: Bright red blood on the finger usually signifies a caecal lesion. This statement is false, as bright red blood on the finger is more commonly associated with lower GI bleeding, such as hemorrhoids or diverticula, rather than caecal lesions. According to Document [8] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison), bright red blood passed with or on formed brown stool usually has a rectal, anal, or distal sigmoid source. Now, let's consider option C: Proctoscopy is of no value in the assessment of rectal bleeding. This statement is false, as proctoscopy is an important diagnostic tool for assessing rectal bleeding, especially when combined with anoscopy. According to Document [8] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison), anoscopy and proctoscopy should be performed to exclude polyps or cancers in the distal colon. Finally, let's consider option D: Rectal cancer is the commonest cause of rectal bleeding. This statement is false, as the most common causes of rectal bleeding are hemorrhoids, diverticula, and anal fissures, according to Document [12] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison). Therefore, the correct answer is A: A painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" } ``` The final answer is A.",

Colonoscopy has a higher diagnostic yield than radionuclide bleeding scans or angiography in lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and endoscopic therapy can be applied in some cases. In a minority of cases, endoscopic assessment is hindered by poor visualization due to persistent vigorous bleeding with recurrent hemodynamic instability, and other techniques (such as angiography or emergent subtotal colectomy) must be employed. In such patients, massive bleeding originating from an upper gastrointestinal source should also be considered and excluded by upper endoscopy. The anal and rectal mucosa should be visualized endoscopically early in the course of massive rectal bleeding, because bleeding lesions in or close to the anal canal may be identified that are amenable to endoscopic or surgical"

Pain is less common than with fissures and, if present, is described as a dull ache from engorgement of the hemorrhoidal tissue. Severe pain may indicate a thrombosed hemorrhoid. Hemorrhoidal bleeding is described as painless bright red blood seen either in the toilet or upon wiping. Occasional patients can present with significant bleeding, which may be a cause of anemia; however, the presence of a colonic neoplasm must be ruled out in anemic patients. Patients who present with a protruding mass complain about inability to maintain perianal hygiene and are often concerned about the presence of a malignancy."

On histologic examination, hemorrhoids consist of thin-walled, dilated, submucosal vessels beneath anal or rectal mucosa. These vessels are subject to trauma, which leads to rectal bleeding. In addition, they can become thrombosed and inflamed. Hemorrhoids often manifest with pain and rectal bleeding, particularly bright red blood seen on toilet tissue. Hemorrhoids also may develop as a result of portal hypertension, where the implications are more ominous. Hemorrhoidal bleeding generally is not a medical emergency; treatment options include sclerotherapy, rubber band ligation, and infrared coagulation.

A rectal examination, including inspection for fissures, skin tags, abscesses, and fistulous openings, should be performed for children with history suggesting constipation, GI bleeding, abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, and suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Digital rectal examination should include assessment of anal sphincter tone, anal canal size and elasticity, tenderness, extrinsic masses, presence of fecal impaction, and caliber of the rectum. Stool should be tested for occult blood."

In young patients without a family history of colorectal cancer, the hemorrhoidal disease may be treated first and a colonoscopic examination performed if the bleeding continues. Older patients who have not had colorectal cancer screening should undergo colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy."

Care should be taken to place bands properly and to avoid overhydration in patients undergoing operative hemorrhoidectomy. Late complications include fecal incontinence as a result of injury to the sphincter during the dissection. Anal stenosis may develop from overzealous excision, with loss of mucosal skin bridges for reepithelialization. Finally, an ectropion (prolapse of rectal mucosa from the anal canal) may develop. Patients with an ectropion complain of a \u201cwet\u201d anus as a result of inability to prevent soiling once the rectal mucosa is exposed below the dentate line.
