A nonsense mutation is a type of point mutation that results in the creation of a premature stop codon, leading to the termination of protein synthesis. This occurs when a single nucleotide change in the DNA sequence alters a codon to a stop codon, UAA, UAG, or UGA. As a result, the translation process is interrupted, and the protein is truncated. Now, let's analyze each option in relation to the definition of a nonsense mutation.\\n\\nOption A: a regulatory sequence. - While regulatory sequences are important in gene expression, they are not directly related to the definition of a nonsense mutation.\\n\\nOption B: an AG splice acceptor site. - An AG splice acceptor site is involved in the splicing process, but it is not the primary characteristic of a nonsense mutation.\\n\\nOption C: the creation of a different amino acid. - This option is incorrect because a nonsense mutation does not result in the creation of a different amino acid; instead, it leads to the termination of protein synthesis.\\n\\nOption D: the creation of a stop codon. - This is the correct answer. A nonsense mutation involves the creation of a premature stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA), which leads to the termination of protein synthesis.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"D\"}",

A point mutation that changes a codon and the resulting amino acid thatgoes into the protein is referred to as a missense mutation. A nonsense mutation is a point mutation that changes thecodon to a \u201cstop\u201d codon so that transcription stops prematurely. A frameshift mutation often stems from the loss or addition of one or more DNA bases; this causes a shift in how the DNA is transcribed and generally leads to premature stop codons."

The mutation in the \u03b2-globin chain of hemoglobin giving rise to sickle cell anemia is an excellent example of a point mutation that alters the meaning of the genetic code. Such mutations are sometimes called missense mutations. By contrast, certain point mutations may change an amino acid codon to a chain termination codon, or a stop codon. Such \u201cnonsense\u201d mutations interrupt translation, and in most cases RNAs are rapidly degraded, a phenomenon called nonsense mediated decay, such that little or no protein is formed."

Gain-of-function mutations are typically dominant (e.g., they result in phenotypic alterations when a single allele is affected). Inactivating mutations are usually recessive, and an affected individual is homozygous or compound heterozygous (e.g., carrying two different mutant alleles of the same gene) for the disease-causing mutations. Alternatively, mutation in a single allele can result in haploinsufficiency, a situation in which one normal allele is not sufficient to maintain a normal phenotype. Haploinsufficiency is a commonly observed mechanism in diseases associated with mutations in transcription factors (Table 82-2). Remarkably, the clinical features among patients with an identical mutation in a transcription factor often vary significantly. One mechanism underlying this variability consists in the influence of modifying genes."

            "content": "Frameshift mutations: If one or two nucleotides are either deleted from or added to the coding region of an mRNA, a frameshift mutation occurs, altering the reading frame. This can result in a product with a radically different amino acid sequence or a truncated product due to the eventual creation of a termination codon (Fig. 32.5). If three nucleotides are added, a new amino acid is added to the peptide. If three are deleted, an amino acid is lost. Loss of three nucleotides maintains the reading frame but can result in serious pathology. For example, cystic fibrosis (CF), a chronic, progressive, inherited disease that primarily affects the pulmonary and digestive systems, is most commonly caused by deletion of three nucleotides from the coding region of a gene, resulting in the loss of phenylalanine (Phe, or F; see p. 5) at the 508th position (\u2206F508) in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein encoded by that gene. This \u2206F508 mutation prevents normal folding of"

            "content": "Thus, for example, a mutation in a nucleotide sequence critical for splicing of a particular intron does not necessarily prevent splicing of that intron altogether. Instead, the mutation typically creates a new pattern of splicing (Figure 6\u201333). Most commonly, an exon is simply skipped (Figure 6\u201333B). In other cases, the mutation causes a cryptic splice junction to be efficiently used (Figure 6\u201333C). Apparently, the splicing machinery has evolved to pick out the best possible pattern of splice junctions, and if the optimal one is damaged by mutation, it will seek out the next best pattern, and so on. This inherent plasticity in the process of RNA splicing suggests that changes in splicing patterns caused by random mutations have been important in the evolution of genes and organisms. It also means that mutations that affect splicing can be severely detrimental to the organism: in addition to the \u03b2 thalassemia, example presented in Figure 6\u201333, aberrant"
