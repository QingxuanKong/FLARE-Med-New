The preprostatic part of the urethra is about 1 cm long, extends from the base of the bladder to the prostate, and is associated with a circular cuff of smooth muscle fibers (the internal urethral sphincter). Contraction of this sphincter prevents retrograde movement of semen into the bladder during ejaculation. Prostatic part. The prostatic part of the urethra (Fig. 5.45C) is 3 to 4 cm long and is surrounded by the prostate. In this region, the lumen of the urethra is marked by a longitudinal midline fold of mucosa (the urethral crest). The depression on each side of the crest is the prostatic sinus; the ducts of the prostate empty into these two sinuses."

At birth, the bladder is almost entirely abdominal; the urethra begins approximately at the upper margin of the pubic symphysis. With age, the bladder descends until after puberty when it assumes the adult position. The urethra begins at the base of the bladder and ends with an external opening in the perineum. The paths taken by the urethra differ significantly in women and men. In women, the urethra is short, being about 4 cm long. It travels a slightly curved course as it passes inferiorly through the pelvic floor into the perineum, where it passes through the deep perineal pouch and perineal membrane before opening in the vestibule that lies between the labia minora (Fig. 5.45A)."

The average adult bladder holds approximately 500 mL of urine; however, in rare cases, capacity can reach up to or greater than 1000 mL, in which case the bladder extends towards the umbilicus. The sigmoid colon lies adjacent to the bladder and can fistulize to the lateral wall or dome of the bladder in cases of diverticulitis or colon cancer. The rectum lies posteriorly to the bladder in men, and the uterus and vagina lie posteriorly to the bladder in women.The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that encircles the urethra and is located in males immediately beneath the blad-der neck. Smooth muscle fibers distribute throughout the gland, which can contract"

            "content": "Benign prostatic hypertrophy is a disease of the prostate that occurs with increasing age in most men (Fig. 5.49B). It generally involves the more central regions of the prostate (see Fig. 5.48), which gradually enlarge. The prostate feels \u201cbulky\u201d on DRE. Owing to the more central hypertrophic change of the prostate, the urethra is compressed, and a urinary outflow obstruction develops in a number of patients. With time, the bladder may become hypertrophied in response to the urinary outflow obstruction. In some male patients, the obstruction becomes so severe that urine cannot be passed and transurethral or suprapubic catheterization is necessary. Despite being a benign disease, benign prostatic hypertrophy can therefore have a marked effect on the daily lives of many patients. In the clinic"

It contains three openings, two for the ureters (ureteric orifces) and one for the urethra (internal urethral orifce). The triangular region defined by these three openings, the trigone, is relatively smooth and constant in thickness, whereas the rest of the bladder wall is thick and folded when the bladder is empty and thin and smooth when the bladder is distended. These differences reflect the embryologic origins of the trigone and the rest of the bladder wall: the trigone is derived from the embryonic mesonephric ducts, and the major portion of the wall originates from the cloaca."

            "content": "Urethra. The female urethra measures 3 to 4 cm and originates within the bladder trigone (p. 28). he distal two thirds of the urethra are fused with the anterior vaginal wall. The epithelialilining of the urethra changes from transitional epithelium proximally to nonkeratinized stratiied squamous epithelium distally. The walls of the urethra consist of two layers of smooth muscle, an inner longitudinal and an outer circular. This is in turn surrounded by a circular layer of skeletal muscle referred to as the sphincter urethrae or rhabdosphincter (see Fig. 2-6). Approximately at the junction of the middle and lower third of the urethra, and just above or deep to the perineal membrane, two strap skeletal muscles called the urethrovaginal sphincter and compressor urethrae are found. Together with the sphincter urethrae, these constitute the striated urogenital sphincter complex. This complex supplies constant tonus and provides emergency relex contraction to sustain continence."

            "content": "The urinary bladder receives the urine from the two ureters and stores it until neural stimulation causes it to contract and expel the urine via the urethra. It, too, is lined with transitional epithelium (urothelium). Beneath the epithelium and its underlying con-nective tissue, the wall of the urinary bladder contains smooth muscle that is usually described as being arranged as an inner longitudinal layer, a middle circular layer, and an outer longitudinal layer. As in most distensible hollow viscera that empty their con-tents through a narrow aperture, the smooth muscle in the wall of the urinary bladder is less regularly arranged than the description indicates, allowing contraction to re-duce the volume relatively evenly throughout the bladder. ORIENTATION MICROGRAPH: This orientation micrograph of the urinary blad-der reveals the full thickness of the bladder wall. The luminal surface epithelium is at the top of the micrograph. One of the ureters can be seen as it passes through"
