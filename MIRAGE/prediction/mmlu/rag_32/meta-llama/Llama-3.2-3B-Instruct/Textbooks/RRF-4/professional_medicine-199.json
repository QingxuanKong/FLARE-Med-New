    "question": "A 70-year-old woman comes to the office because of worsening tremor of her hands. The tremor has been present for most of her life and initially was mild and would occur only when she was tired or stressed. During the past month the shaking has become more noticeable and frequent. She is now embarrassed to eat with other people because of how obvious the tremor has become. The patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks to help her to cope with the death of her husband 2 months ago. Medical history is also remarkable for essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin. Her only other medication is occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. She used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks one glass of wine daily because, she says, it reduces her tremor. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (155 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.4\u00b0C (97.6\u00b0F), pulse 80/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a moderate tremor of both hands that is not present at rest. Complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and serum thyroid function tests are ordered and results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor, we need to consider her medical history, medication use, and the timing of the worsening tremor. The patient has a history of essential hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and she has been taking fluoxetine for 3 weeks to cope with the death of her husband. She has also increased her alcohol consumption to one glass of wine daily. The tremor has worsened over the past month, becoming more noticeable and frequent. We need to evaluate the potential causes and consider the patient's medication use and lifestyle changes.\\n\\nFirst, let's consider the potential causes of the worsening tremor. The patient's tremor has been present for most of her life and was initially mild, suggesting that it may be a long-standing condition. The tremor has worsened over the past month, which could be due to various factors such as stress, fatigue, or other medical conditions.\\n\\nThe patient is taking fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which can cause tremors as an adverse effect. However, the timing of the worsening tremor, which occurred after the patient started taking fluoxetine, suggests that the medication may be contributing to the worsening tremor. Additionally, the patient's tremor was initially mild and present only when she was tired or stressed, which could be related to the medication.\\n\\nThe patient's increased alcohol consumption could also be contributing to the worsening tremor. Alcohol can exacerbate tremors in individuals with essential tremor, and the patient's daily wine consumption may be increasing her tremor symptoms.\\n\\nConsidering the patient's medical history and medication use, the most likely cause of the worsening tremor is the adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy. The patient's tremor was initially mild and present only when she was tired or stressed, which could be related to the medication. The timing of the worsening tremor, which occurred after the patient started taking fluoxetine, further supports this conclusion.\\n\\nThe other options are less likely causes of the worsening tremor. Bereavement reaction (B) is a possible cause of anxiety and depression, but it is not directly related to the worsening tremor. Early Parkinson disease (C) is a possible cause of tremor, but the patient's medical history and physical examination do not suggest Parkinson disease. Increase in alcohol consumption (D) may exacerbate tremors, but the patient's daily wine consumption is not sufficient to cause significant tremor worsening.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor is the adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Beta blockers and primidone are the standard drug therapies for ET and help in about 50% of cases. Propranolol (20\u2013120 mg daily, given in 2620 divided doses) is usually effective at relatively low doses, but higher doses may be effective in some patients. The drug is contraindicated in patients with bradycardia or asthma. Hand tremor tends to be most improved, while head tremor is often refractory. Primidone can be helpful but should be started at low doses (12.5 mg) and gradually increased (125\u2013250 mg tid) to avoid sedation. Benefits have also been reported with gabapentin and topiramate. Botulinum toxin injections may be helpful for limb or voice tremor, but treatment can be associated with secondary"

At least three gene loci (ETM1 on 3q13, ETM2 on 2p24.1, and a locus on 6p23) have been described, as having associations with various other mapped loci. Dysfunction of \u03b21 receptors has been implicated in some instances, since the tremor may respond dramatically to standard doses of metoprolol as well as to propranolol. The tremor may involve the hands, head, voice, and\u2014much less commonly\u2014the legs. Patients may become functionally limited or socially withdrawn, quality of life is affected, and some patients report being seriously disabled by the tremor."

It can present in childhood but dramatically increases in prevalence over the age of 70 years. ET is characterized by a high-frequency tremor (6\u201310 Hz) that predominantly affects the upper extremities. The tremor is most often manifest as a postural or action (kinetic) tremor and, in severe cases, can interfere with functions such as eating and drinking. It is typically bilateral and symmetric but may begin on one side and remain asymmetric. Patients with severe ET can have an intention tremor with overshoot and slowness of movement. Tremor involves the head in ~30% of cases, voice in ~20%, tongue in ~20%, face/jaw in ~10%, and lower limbs in ~10%. The tremor is characteristically improved by alcohol and worsened by stress. Subtle impairment of coordination or tandem walking may be present, and disturbances of hearing, cognition, personality, mood, and olfaction have also been"

In about one-quarter of cases the tremor is mild and intermittent, or evident in only 1 finger or 1 hand. The tremor of the fully developed case takes several forms, as was remarked in Chap. 4. The approximately 4-per-second \u201cpill-rolling\u201d tremor of the thumb and fingers, although most characteristic, is seen in only about half the patients. It is typically present when the hand is motionless, that is not used in voluntary movement (hence the commonly used term resting tremor). Complete relaxation, however, reduces or abolishes the tremor, so that the term tremor in repose is a more accurate description. Volitional movement dampens it momentarily.

She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes.

Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination?
