    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the genetic basis of Angelman syndrome. According to the provided documents, Angelman syndrome is characterized by a deletion in the 15q11 region in 70% of affected individuals, and UPD for chromosome 15 can be demonstrated in approximately 10% of AS patients. If the deletion occurs in paternal chromosome 15, the affected individual has Prader-Willi syndrome, whereas AS results from a deletion occurring only in the maternal chromosome 15. When UPD is responsible, maternal UPD results in Prader-Willi syndrome, whereas paternal UPD results in Angelman syndrome. Therefore, the correct answer is related to a deletion in the maternal chromosome 15. Let's analyze the options: A. Maternal UPD 15 - This would result in Prader-Willi syndrome, not Angelman syndrome. B. Paternal UPD 15 - This would also result in Prader-Willi syndrome. C. Deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15 - This would result in Prader-Willi syndrome. D. A mutation in the SNRPN promoter - This could potentially result in Angelman syndrome, as the UBE3A gene is imprinted on the paternal chromosome and its silencing leads to Angelman syndrome. However, the question asks about a deletion, not a mutation. Therefore, the correct answer is D. A mutation in the SNRPN promoter is not a deletion, but the documents suggest that a deletion in the maternal chromosome 15 would result in Angelman syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Hypotonia (floppy infant), areflexia, small stature, dysmorphic facies, and hypoplastic genitalia are evident, and arthrogryposis may be present at birth. After the first year, developmental delay becomes obvious and obesity, due to hyperphagia, becomes prominent. Patients are identified by the \u201cH3O\u201d mnemonic, referring to hypomentia, hypotonia, hypogonadism, and obesity.

Gene inactivation through genomic imprinting occurs on selected chromosomal regions of autosomes and leads to inheritable preferential expression of one of the parental alleles.

Hemophilia B is a coagulopathy caused by decreased thrombin production by the common pathway as a result of a deficiency in FIX of the intrinsic pathway. Because the extrinsic pathway also can result in thrombin production, blocking the inhibitor of this pathway (tissue factor pathway inhibitor) should, in principle, increase thrombin production. 5.13. The parents of a newborn baby girl refuse to allow the baby to be given the injection of vitamin K that is recommended shortly after birth to prevent vitamin K deficiency bleeding, which is caused by the low levels of the vitamin in newborns. The activity of which one of the following protein factors involved in clotting would be decreased with vitamin K deficiency? A. FV B. FVII C. FXI D. FXII E. FXIII"

Patient #2 has a normal fasting blood glucose (FBG) but an impaired glucose tolerance (GT) as reflected in her blood glucose level at 2 hours and, so, is described as prediabetic.

Decreased activity of hormone-sensitive lipase B. Decreased gluconeogenesis from lactate C. Decreased glycogenolysis D. Increased formation of 3-hydroxybutyrate E. Increased glycogenesis"

            "content": "As mentioned in the introduction, a mid-twentieth-century discovery of outstanding significance was the recognition of a group of developmental anomalies of the brain and other organs associated with a demonstrable abnormality of the karyotype of autosomal and sex chromosomes. Jacobs and Lejeune in 1959 almost simultaneously were the first to note a triplication of the 21st chromosome in Down syndrome, and there followed the discovery of a number of other trisomies as well as deletions or translocations of other autosomal chromosomes and a lack or excess of one of the sex chromosomes. Such an event must take place sometime after the formation of the oocyte, during the long period when it lies fallow in the ovary or during the process of conception or germination and first cell divisions. Thus, all the cells in the embryo may carry the changed chromosome, or only some of them may carry it, the latter condition being called mosaicism."
