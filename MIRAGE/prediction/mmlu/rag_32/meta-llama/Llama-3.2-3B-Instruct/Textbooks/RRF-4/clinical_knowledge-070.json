    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the context of adhesive strips and their removal. Adhesive strips are often used to close wounds or incisions, and their removal is crucial to prevent complications such as infection, scarring, and adhesion formation. The question asks about the timing of removal, and the options provided suggest different approaches. Option A, carried out by the patient, is not typically recommended as it may lead to infection or other complications. Option C, a specialist skill, is also not correct as removal of adhesive strips is a common procedure that can be performed by a healthcare professional with proper training. Option D, not undertaken until at least seven days after application, may not be necessary as the risk of infection or other complications increases with delayed removal. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B, should be undertaken under aseptic conditions, as it ensures a sterile environment and minimizes the risk of infection. This approach is in line with standard medical practices for wound care and surgical procedures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Blind clamping of these vessels presents a risk for ureteral injury; therefore, the ureters should be identified in the retroperitoneal space and traced to the area of bleeding to avoid inadvertent ligation. It is best to apply a pressure pack to tamponade the bleeding and slowly remove the pack in an effort to visualize, isolate, and individually clamp the bleeding vessels. Mass ligatures should be avoided. The use of surgical clips may be helpful. Venous bleeding is less dramatic but often is more difficult to manage, particularly in the presence of extensive adhesions and fibroids. This type of bleeding can be controlled with pressure alone or with suture ligation. Bleeding from peritoneal edges or denuded surfaces may be controlled with pressure, application of topical agents such as thrombin or collagen, or Bovie cautery. A variety"

However, in this manner tunnels must be created within the myometrium in order to extract distant fibroids, making hemostasis more difficult within these defects. Hemostasis is important in order to avoid adhesion formation, and fibrin, leucocytes, and platelets in the presence of erythrocytes leads to adhesion formation. If tunneling incisions are avoided and hemostasis secured immediately, the risk of adhesion formation should be lessened. Therefore, if incisions are made directly over the fibroids and only those fibroids that are easily accessed are removed, the defects can be promptly closed and hemostasis can be secured immediately (112). Multiple uterine incisions may be needed, but adhesion barriers may help limit adhesion formation (127)."

Surgical trauma is minimized within the peritoneum by careful tissue handling, avoiding desiccation and ischemia, and spare use of cautery, laser, and retractors. Fewer adhesions form with laparoscopic surgical techniques due to reduced tis-sue trauma. The second major advance in adhesion prevention has been the introduction of barrier membranes and gels, which separate and create barriers between damaged mesothelial sur-faces, allowing for adhesion-free healing. Currently, only three products are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for reducing adhesion formation: Interceed (oxidized regen-erated cellulose, indicated only in pelvic surgery), Seprafilm (a film composed of hyaluronic acid and carboxymethylcel-lulose) that is usually applied below the incision, and Adept (4% icodextrin, a corn starch derivative in electrolyte solution, also for use mainly in pelvic surgery).

The treatment of labial adhesions consists of a brief course (2 to 6 weeks) of externally applied estrogen cream. The area of agglutination (adhesion) will become thin as a result, and separation can usually be performed in the office with the use of a topical anesthetic (e.g., lidocaine jelly) (Fig. 14.9B). Manual separation in the office without pretreatment with topical estrogen and without anesthesia is discouraged, as this practice may be so traumatic to the child that she will not allow subsequent examination. In the absence of a previously traumatic examination or previous surgical separation with recurrence, surgical separation frequently is not required (42).

This cement stained deeply at the apicolateral margin of most cuboidal and columnar epithelial cells. When viewed in a plane perpendi cular to the epithelial surface, the stained material appears as a dotlike structure. When the plane of section passes parallel to and includes the epithelial surface, however, the dotlike component is seen as a dense bar or line between the apposing cells (Fig. 5.13). The bars, in fact, form a polygonal structure (or band) that encircles each cell to bind them together.

This tissue can become encased in adhesions and result in painful cysts. Often, the patient had multiple pelvic operations with the uterus and adnexa removed sequentially. Laparoscopic oophorectomy, combined with a difficult dissection, is a strong risk factor. Residual ovary syndrome is uncommon considering the number of women undergoing hysterectomy with ovarian preservation.

A vein stripper is passed up the esophagus into the neck wound. The distal portion of the esophagus in the neck is secured tightly around the stripping cable with \u201cendoloops\u201d and an umbilical tape for a trailer. The tip of the stripper is exchanged for a mushroom head, and the stripper is pulled back into the abdomen, inverting the esopha-gus as it transverses the posterior mediastinum. This maneuver strips the branches of the esophageal plexus off the longitudi-nal muscle of the esophagus,"

            "content": "Because of its location in the terminal or apical portion of the cell and its barlike configuration, the stainable material visible in light microscopy was called the terminal bar. It is now evident that intercellular cement as such does not exist. The terminal bar, however, does represent a significant structural complex. Electron microscopy has shown that it includes a specialized site that joins epithelial cells (Fig. 5.14a). It is also the site of a considerable barrier to the passage (diffusion) of substances between adjacent epithelial cells. The specific structural components that make up the barrier and the attachment device are readily identified with the EM and are collectively referred to as a junctional complex (see Table 5.4, page 135). These complexes are responsible for joining individual cells together. There are three types of junctional complexes (Fig. 5.14b): \u0081 Occluding junctions are impermeable and allow epithelial cells to function as a barrier. Also called tight"

Larger varicose veins require higher concentrations: 23.4% hypertonic saline, 0.50% to 1% sodium tetradecyl sulfate, and 0.75% to 1.0% polidocanol.92 Elastic bandages are wrapped around the leg after injection and worn continuously for 3 to 5 days to produce apposition of the inflamed vein walls and prevent thrombus formation. After the bandages are removed, elastic compression stockings should be worn for a minimum of 2 weeks. Complications from sclero-therapy include allergic reaction, local hyperpigmentation, thrombophlebitis, DVT, and possible skin necrosis.Newer devices combine sclerotherapy with catheter-based mechanical endoluminal injury to achieve nonthermal ablation.98 Additional nonthermal, nonsclerosant ablative techniques using proprietary adhesive formulations with cyanoacrylate are current being evaluated and have demonstrated promising early results.99Patients with symptomatic GSV or SSV reflux may be treated"

            "content": "Analysis of studies that routinely used hysteroscopy to confirm clear nondistortion of the cavity by intramural fibroids found ongoing pregnancy/live birth rates were not significantly different compared to controls (RR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.38\u20131.40) (66). Importantly, removal of intramural or subserosal fibroids did not improve ongoing pregnancy/live birth rates (RR 1.67; 95% CI, 0.75\u20133.72). Myomectomy may involve operative and anesthetic risks, risks of infection or postoperative adhesions, a slight risk of uterine rupture during pregnancy, an increased likelihood that a cesarean section will be recommended for delivery, and the expense of surgery and time for recovery. Therefore, until intramural fibroids are shown to decrease and myomectomy to increase fertility rates, surgery should be undertaken with reluctance (66). Randomized studies are needed to clarify the relative risks and benefits of surgical intervention."
