In the case of the nucleotides in DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose attached to a single phosphate group (hence the name deoxyribonucleic acid), and the base may be either adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T).

Given these findings, it is not clear why protein catalysts greatly outnumber ribozymes in modern cells. Experiments have shown, however, that RNA molecules may have more difficulty than proteins in binding to flexible, hydrophobic substrates. In any case, the availability of 20 types of amino acids presumably provides proteins with a greater number of catalytic strategies. RNA molecules have one property that contrasts with those of polypeptides: they can directly guide the formation of copies of their own sequence. This capacity depends on complementary base-pairing of their nucleotide subunits, which enables one RNA to act as a template for the formation of another. As we have seen in this and the preceding chapter, these complementary templating mechanisms lie at the heart of DNA replication and transcription in modern-day cells."

The synthesis reactions for these three types of macromolecules are outlined in Figure 2\u201341. As indicated, the condensation step in each case depends on energy from nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis. And yet, except for the nucleic acids, there are no phosphate groups left in the final product molecules. How are the reactions that release the energy of ATP hydrolysis coupled to polymer synthesis? For each type of macromolecule, an enzyme-catalyzed pathway exists which resembles that discussed previously for the synthesis of the amino acid glutamine (see Figure 2\u201335). The principle is exactly the same, in that the \u2013OH group that will"

            "content": "The enzymes that perform transcription are called RNA polymerases. Like the DNA polymerase that catalyzes DNA replication (discussed in Chapter 5), RNA polymerases catalyze the formation of the phosphodiester bonds that link the nucleotides together to form a linear chain. The RNA polymerase moves stepwise along the DNA, unwinding the DNA helix just ahead of the active site for polymerization to expose a new region of the template strand for complementary Figure 6\u20137 RNA can fold into specific structures. RNA is largely single-stranded, but it often contains short stretches of nucleotides that can form conventional base pairs with complementary sequences found elsewhere on the same molecule. These interactions, along with additional \u201cnonconventional\u201d base-pair interactions, allow an RNA molecule to fold into a three-dimensional structure that is determined by its sequence of nucleotides (Movie 6.1)."

Inosine monophosphate synthesis The next nine steps in purine nucleotide biosynthesis leading to the synthesis of inosine monophosphate ([IMP] whose base is hypoxanthine) are illustrated in Figure 22.7. IMP is the parent purine nucleotide for AMP and GMP. Four steps in this pathway require ATP as an energy source, and two steps in the pathway require N10-formyl-THF as a one-carbon donor (see p. 267). [Note: Hypoxanthine is found in tRNA (see Fig. 32.9 on p. 453).] D. Synthetic inhibitors Some synthetic inhibitors of purine synthesis (for example, the sulfonamides) are designed to inhibit the growth of rapidly dividing microorganisms without interfering with human cell functions (see Fig. 22.7). Other purine synthesis inhibitors, such as structural analogs of folic acid (for example, methotrexate), are used pharmacologically to control the spread of cancer by interfering with the synthesis of nucleotides and, therefore, of DNA and RNA (see Fig. 22.7)."
