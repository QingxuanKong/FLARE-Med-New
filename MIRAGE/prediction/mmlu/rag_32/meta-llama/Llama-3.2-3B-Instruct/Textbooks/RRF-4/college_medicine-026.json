    "question": "While working on a scene for an action movie, a sound technician is given the task of changing the frequency of a gunshot to more accurately reflect the normal speed of sound. The gunshot came from an actor inside a car traveling 108 km/h, and it was recorded by a camera on a platform 200 meters away traveling at 72 km/h in the same direction. If the frequency of the gunshot is normally 800Hz, what is the perceived frequency which the camera picks up the gunshot at?",

        "A": "941 Hz",
        "B": "787 Hz",

    "predict": "To determine the perceived frequency of the gunshot, we need to consider the Doppler effect, which describes how the frequency of a sound changes when the source and observer are moving relative to each other. Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. The car (source of the gunshot) is moving at 108 km/h in the same direction as the camera (observer). 2. The camera is moving at 72 km/h in the same direction as the car. 3. Since both the car and the camera are moving in the same direction, we need to consider the relative motion between the car and the camera. First, let's convert the speeds from km/h to m/s: Car speed = 108 km/h = 108,000 m/3600 s = 30 m/s Camera speed = 72 km/h = 72,000 m/3600 s = 20 m/s The relative speed between the car and the camera is the difference between their speeds: Relative speed = Car speed - Camera speed = 30 m/s - 20 m/s = 10 m/s Now, we can use the Doppler effect formula to calculate the perceived frequency (f') of the gunshot: f' = f \u00d7 (1 - v / c) where: f' = perceived frequency f = original frequency (800 Hz) v = relative speed (10 m/s) c = speed of sound (335 m/s) Plugging in the values, we get: f' = 800 Hz \u00d7 (1 - 10 m/s / 335 m/s) f' = 800 Hz \u00d7 (1 - 0.0298) f' = 800 Hz \u00d7 0.9702 f' \u2248 776 Hz However, we need to consider the options provided, and none of them match our calculated value. It seems that the question might be asking for the perceived frequency as a percentage change from the original frequency, rather than the absolute value. Let's recalculate the percentage change: Percentage change = ((f' - f) / f) \u00d7 100% = ((776 Hz - 800 Hz) / 800 Hz) \u00d7 100% = (-24 Hz / 800 Hz) \u00d7 100% = -3% Since the percentage change is negative, it means the perceived frequency is lower than the original frequency. However, this is not among the options. Wait, let's re-examine the options. We made a mistake earlier. The correct calculation for the perceived frequency is: f' = f \u00d7 (1 + v / c) = 800 Hz \u00d7 (1 + 10 m/s / 335 m/s) = 800 Hz \u00d7 (1 + 0.0298) = 800 Hz \u00d7 1.0298 f' \u2248 817.92 Hz Now, let's find the closest option: 817.92 Hz \u2248 818 Hz (which is not an option) However, 817 Hz is close to option C. 824 Hz is not among the options, but 817 Hz is close to 817 Hz, so we can assume that the correct answer is option C. 924 Hz is too high, and 787 Hz is too low, but 817 Hz is close to one of the options. However, since 817 Hz is not an option, I will choose the closest answer option, which is C.",

Each pure tone results from a sinusoidal wave at a particular frequency and is characterized not only by its frequency but also, instantaneously, by its amplitude and phase ( Fig. 8.15 ). Most naturally occurring sound, however, is a mixture of pure tones. Noise is unwanted sound and may have any composition of pure tones. Sound propagates at about 335 m/sec in air. The waves are associated with certain pressure changes, called sound pressure. The unit of sound pressure is Newtons per meter squared (N/m2), but sound pressure is more commonly expressed as the sound pressure level (SPL). The unit of SPL is the decibel (dB):"

A decibel (dB) is equal to 20 times the logarithm of the ratio of the sound pressure required to achieve threshold in the patient to the sound pressure required to achieve threshold in a normal-hearing person. Therefore, a change of 6 dB represents doubling of sound pressure, and a change of 20 dB represents a tenfold change in sound pressure. Loudness, which depends on the frequency, intensity, and duration of a sound, doubles with approximately each 10-dB increase in sound pressure level. Pitch, on the other hand, does not directly correlate with frequency. The perception of pitch changes slowly in the low and high frequencies. In the middle tones, which are important for human speech, pitch varies more rapidly with changes in frequency."

Sound waves bounce off moving structures and are returned. The degree of frequency shift determines whether the object is moving away from or toward the probe and the speed at which it is traveling. Precise measurements of blood flow and blood velocity can therefore be obtained, which in turn can indicate sites of blockage in blood vessels. Computed tomography (CT) was invented in the 1970s by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1979.

A sound of specified frequency causes displacement of a relatively long segment of the basilar membrane, but the region of maximal displacement is narrow. The point of maximal displacement of the basilar membrane is specified for a given frequency of sound and is the morphologic basis of frequency discrimination. High-frequency sounds cause maximal vibration of the basilar membrane near the base of the cochlea; low-frequency sounds cause maximal displacement nearer the apex. Amplitude discrimination (i.e., perception of sound intensity or loudness) depends on the degree of displacement of the basilar membrane at any given frequency range. Thus, coding acoustic information into nerve impulses depends on the vibratory pattern of the basilar membrane. Movement of the stereocilia of the hair cells in the cochlea initiates neuronal transduction."

Specifically, the sensory stimulus for this reflex is slip of the visual scene on the retina as detected by motion-sensitive retinal ganglion cells. An example of the former occurs when you are sitting in a train and a train on the adjacent track begins moving: Your eyes rotate to keep the image of the neighboring car stable.

            "content": "Beginning in the cochlea, the frequency specificity is maintained at each point of the central auditory pathway: dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei, trapezoid body, superior olivary complex, lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body, and auditory cortex. At low frequencies, individual auditory nerve fibers can respond more or less synchronously with the stimulating tone. At higher frequencies, phase-locking occurs so that neurons alternate in response to particular phases of the cycle of the sound wave. Intensity is encoded by the amount of neural activity in individual neurons, the number of neurons that are active, and the specific neurons that are activated."

Kraepelin referred to it as the \u201challucinatory insanity of drunkards,\u201d or \u201calcoholic mania.\u201d A report of 75 such cases was made by Victor and Hope. The central feature of the illness, in the beginning, is the occurrence of auditory hallucinations despite an otherwise clear sensorium during the withdrawal period; that is, the patients are not disoriented or obtunded, and they have an intact memory. The hallucinations may take the form of unstructured sounds such as buzzing, ringing, gunshots, or clicking (the elementary hallucinations of Bleuler), or they may have a musical quality, like a low-pitched hum or chant. The most common hallucinations, however, are human voices. When the voices can be identified, they are often attributed to the patient\u2019s family, friends, or neighbors\u2014rarely to God, radio, or television. The voices may be addressed directly to the"

In the scenario of tan-gential high energy GSWs, however, it is possible to sustain a transmitted intraperitoneal hollow visceral injury due to a blast insult. Gunshot wounds to the back or flank are more difficult to evaluate because of the retroperitoneal location of the injured abdominal organs. Triple-contrast CT scan can delineate the trajectory of the bullet and identify peritoneal violation or retro-peritoneal entry, and associated injuries.In contrast to gunshot wounds, stab wounds that penetrate the peritoneal cavity are less likely to injure intra-abdominal organs. Anterior abdominal stab wounds (from costal margin to inguinal ligament and bilateral midaxillary lines) should be explored under local anesthesia in the ED to determine if the fascia has been violated. Injuries that do not penetrate the peri-toneal cavity do not require further evaluation, and the"

The sharpness of the excitatory regions may reflect inhibitory processes. The different features of an acoustic stimulus are encoded in the discharges of cochlear nerve fibers. Duration is signaled by the duration of activity; intensity is signaled both by the amount of neural activity and by the number of fibers that discharge. For low-frequency sounds, the frequency is signaled by the tendency of an afferent fiber to discharge in phase with the stimulus (phase locking; see"
