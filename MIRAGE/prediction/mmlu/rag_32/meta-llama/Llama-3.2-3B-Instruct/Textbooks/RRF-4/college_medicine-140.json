The other, much longer, part of the cycle is known as interphase, which includes s phase and the gap phases (discussed in text). The five stages of mitosis are shown: an abrupt change in the biochemical state of the cell occurs at the transition from metaphase to anaphase. a cell can pause in metaphase before this transition point, but once it passes this point, the cell carries on to the end of mitosis and through cytokinesis into interphase."

Mitosis takes place in several stages described in more detail below. Separation of two identical daughter cells concludes the M phase. The M phase possesses two checkpoints: the spindle-assembly checkpoint, which prevents premature entry into anaphase, and the chromosome-segregation checkpoint, which prevents the process of cytokinesis until all of the chromosomes have been correctly separated.

Others can be observed in the process of cytokinesis. Similarly, looking at budding yeast cells under a microscope is very useful, because the size of the bud provides an indication of cell-cycle stage (Figure 17\u20136). We can gain additional clues about cell-cycle position by staining cells with DNA-binding fluorescent dyes (which reveal the condensation of chromosomes in mitosis) or with antibodies that recognize specific cell components such as the microtubules (revealing the mitotic spindle).

Also, during interphase and before cell division, the DNA is replicated and each chromosome is duplicated to produce two closely paired sister DNA molecules (called sister chromatids). A cell with only one type of chromosome, present in maternal and paternal copies, is illustrated here. Once DNA replication is complete, the cell can enter M phase, when mitosis occurs and the nucleus is divided into two daughter nuclei. During this stage, the chromosomes condense, the nuclear envelope breaks down, and the mitotic spindle forms from microtubules and other proteins. The condensed mitotic chromosomes are captured by the mitotic spindle, and one complete set of chromosomes is then pulled to each end of the cell by separating the members of each sister-chromatid pair.

During this phase, the proteinase enzyme separase cleaves the cohesion complexes between the sister chromatids. Cleavage of the cohesin complexes in the region of the centromere releases the bond between both centromeres. This cleavage allows the sister chromatids to separate at anaphase II and move to opposite poles of the cell. During meiosis II, the cells pass through prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II. These stages are essentially the same as those in mitosis except that they involve a haploid set of chromosomes (1n) and produce daughter cells that have only haploid DNA content (1d).

Chromosome duplication occurs during S phase (S for DNA synthesis), which requires 10\u201312 hours and occupies about half of the cell-cycle time in a typical mammalian cell. After S phase, chromosome segregation and cell division occur in M phase (M for mitosis), which requires much less time (less than an hour in a mammalian cell). M phase comprises two major events: nuclear division, or mitosis, during which the copied chromosomes are distributed into a pair of daughter nuclei; and cytoplasmic division, or cytokinesis, when the cell itself divides in two (Figure 17\u20132)."

Mitosis is a process of chromosome segregation and nuclear division followed by cell division that produces two daughter cells with the same chromosome number and DNA content as the parent cell. The term mitosis is used to describe the equal partitioning of replicated chromosomes and their genes into two identical groups. The process of cell division includes division of both the nucleus (karyokinesis) and the cytoplasm (cytokinesis). The process of cytokinesis results in distribution of nonnuclear organelles into two daughter cells. Before entering mitosis, cells duplicate their DNA. This phase of the cell cycle is called the S or synthesis phase. At the beginning of this phase, the chromosome number is (2n), and the DNA content is also (2d); at the end, the chromosome number remains the same (2n), and the DNA content doubles to (4d)."

S-cyclin levels remain elevated until mitosis, and these cyclins also contribute to the control of some early mitotic events. 3. M-cyclins activate Cdks that stimulate entry into mitosis at the G2/M transition. M-cyclin levels fall in mid-mitosis.

The cell cycle is briefly summarized in Figure 4\u201317, and it is discussed in detail in Chapter 17. Briefly, during a long interphase, genes are expressed and chromosomes are replicated, with the two replicas remaining together as a pair of sister chromatids.

Early in mitosis at a stage called prophase, the two DNA molecules are gradually disentangled and condensed into pairs of rigid, compact rods called sister chromatids, which remain linked by sister-chromatid cohesion. When the nuclear envelope disassembles later in mitosis, the sister-chromatid pairs become attached to the mitotic spindle, a giant bipolar array of microtubules (discussed in Chapter 16). Sister chromatids are attached to opposite poles of the spindle and, eventually, align at the spindle equator in a stage called metaphase. The destruction of sister-chromatid cohesion at the start of anaphase separates the sister chromatids, which are pulled to opposite poles of the spindle.

At a minimum, M-Cdk must induce the assembly of the mitotic spindle and ensure that each sister chromatid in a pair is attached to the opposite pole of the spindle. It also triggers chromosome condensation, the large-scale reorganization of the intertwined sister chromatids into compact, rodlike structures. In animal cells, M-Cdk also promotes the breakdown of the nuclear envelope and rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton and the Golgi apparatus.

Then, in the telophase part of mitosis, as chromosomes return to their semi-dispersed state, the tips of the 10 chromosomes reform small nucleoli, which progressively coalesce into a single nucleolus (Figure 6\u201343 and Figure 6\u201344). As might be expected, the size of the nucleolus reflects the number of ribosomes that the cell is producing. Its size therefore varies greatly in different cells and can change in a single cell, occupying 25% of the total nuclear volume in cells that are making unusually large amounts of protein. Ribosome assembly is a complex process, the most important features of which are outlined in Figure 6\u201345. In addition to its central role in ribosome biogenesis, the nucleolus is the site where other noncoding RNAs are produced and other"

            "content": "Figure 6.2 The cell cycle. The cell cycle is divided into four major phases: M phase (mitosis), G1 phase (period between mitosis and initiation of DNA replication), S phase (DNA synthesis), and G2 phase (period between completion of DNA synthesis and mitosis) (Fig. 6.2). Postmitotic cells can \u201cexit\u201d the cell cycle into the so-called G0 phase and remain for days, weeks, or even a lifetime without further proliferation. The duration of the cell cycle may be highly variable, although most human cells complete the cell cycle within approximately 24 hours. During a typical cell cycle, mitosis lasts about 30 to 60 minutes, the G1 phase 7 to 10 hours, S phase 10 hours, and G2 phase 5 hours. With respect to the cell cycle, there are three subpopulations of cells: 1. Terminally differentiated cells cannot re-enter the cell cycle. 2. Quiescent (G0) cells can enter the cell cycle if appropriately stimulated. 3. Dividing cells are currently in the cell cycle."
