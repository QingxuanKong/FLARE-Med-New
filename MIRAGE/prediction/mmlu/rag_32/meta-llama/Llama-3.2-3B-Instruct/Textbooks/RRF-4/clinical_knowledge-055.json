The current epidemic proportions of childhood obesity calls for a fresh and careful look at pediatric drug dosages.

Further, a steep dose-response curve for adverse effects is especially undesirable, as it implies that even small dosage increments may sharply increase the likelihood of toxicity. When there is a definable relationship between drug concentration (usually measured in plasma) and desirable and adverse effect curves, concentration may be substituted on the abscissa.

The exam has a strong emphasis on ANS, CNS, antimicrobial, and cardiovascular agents as well as on NSAIDs, which are covered throughout the text. Specific drug dosages or trade names are generally not testable. The exam may use graphs to test various pharmacology content, so make sure you are comfortable interpreting them. Michaelis-Menten Km is inversely related to the affinity of the [S] = concentration of substrate; V = velocity. kinetics enzyme for its substrate. Vmax is directly proportional to the enzyme concentration."

Input The amount of drug that enters the body depends on the patient\u2019s adherence to the prescribed regimen and on the rate and extent of transfer from the site of administration to the blood. C. Volume of Distribution The apparent volume of distribution reflects a balance between Recognition of the essential role of concentration in linking pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics leads naturally to the target concentration strategy. Pharmacodynamic principles can be used to predict the concentration required to achieve a particular degree of therapeutic effect. This target concentration can then be achieved by using pharmacokinetic principles to arrive at a suitable dosing regimen (Holford, 1999). The target concentration strategy is a process for optimizing the dose in an individual on the basis of a measured surrogate response such as drug concentration: 1. Choose the target concentration, TC. 2."

CHAPTER 3 Pharmacokinetics & Pharmacodynamics: Rational Dosing & the Time Course of Drug Action Sixty-seven percent of total standard digoxin clearance is renal, so the standard renal clearance is 0.67 \u00d7 9 L/h = 6 L/h/70 kg with creatinine clearance of 100 mL/min and nonrenal clearance is (1 0.67) \u00d7 9 L/h = 3 L/h/70 kg (see Table 3\u20131 for standard pharmacokinetic parameters). Her predicted creatinine clearance is 22 mL/min (Cockcroft and Gault), so for digoxin, her renal clearance is 6 \u00d7 22/100 \u00d7 60/70 = 1.1 L/h, nonrenal clearance 2.7 \u00d7 60/70 = 2.6 L/h, and total clearance 3.7 L/h. The parenteral maintenance dose rate is 1 mcg/L \u00d7 3.7 L/h = 3.7 mcg/h. Once-a-day oral dosing with bioavailability of 0.7 would require a daily maintenance dose of 3.7/0.7 \u00d7 24 = 127 mcg/day. A practical dose would be two 62.5 mcg tablets per day.

A large Vd implies that the drug is not readily accessible to measures aimed at purifying the blood, such as hemodialysis. Examples of drugs with large volumes of distribution (>5 L/kg) include antidepressants, antipsychotics, antimalarials, opioids, propranolol, and verapamil. Drugs with a relatively small Vd (<1 L/kg) include salicylate, ethanol, phenobarbital, lithium, valproic acid, and phenytoin (see Table 3\u20131)."
