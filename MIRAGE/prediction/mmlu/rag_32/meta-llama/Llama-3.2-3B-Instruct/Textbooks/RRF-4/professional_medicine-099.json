    "question": "A 52-year-old man comes to the physician with his wife because of a 1-year history of excessive daytime sleepiness. He does not think the symptoms are problematic, but his wife is concerned because he sometimes falls asleep on the sofa early in the evening when guests are present. He also once fell asleep while driving at night and drove off the road, narrowly avoiding injury. His wife says that he has always snored loudly, and over the past year, he has had episodes of choking or gasping for breath while sleeping. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 105 kg (231 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2 . His pulse is 76/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 150/76 mm Hg. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: **Step-by-Step Thinking:** The patient presents with excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, loud snoring, episodes of choking or gasping for breath while sleeping, and falls asleep on the sofa early in the evening when guests are present. These symptoms are suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient's BMI is also high, which increases the risk of OSA. To confirm the diagnosis, we need to investigate the patient's sleep patterns and breathing during sleep. Polysomnography (PSG) is the most comprehensive sleep study that can monitor various aspects of sleep and breathing, including apnea, hypopnea, and oxygen desaturation. **Answer:** ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, loud snoring, episodes of choking or gasping for breath while sleeping, and falls asleep on the sofa early in the evening when guests are present are suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Information from a bed partner or family member is often helpful because some patients may be unaware of symptoms such as heavy snoring or may underreport symptoms such as falling asleep at work or while driving. Physicians should inquire about when the patient typically goes to bed, when they fall asleep and wake up, whether they awaken during sleep, whether they feel rested in the morning, and whether they nap during the day. Depending on the primary complaint, it may be useful to ask about snoring, witnessed apneas, restless sensations in the legs, movements during sleep, depression, anxiety, and behaviors around the sleep episode. The physical exam may provide evidence of a small airway, large tonsils, or a neurologic or medical disorder that contributes to the"

Snoring is the most common complaint; however, its absence does not exclude the diagnosis, as pharyngeal collapse may occur without tissue vibration. Gasping or snorting during sleep may also be reported, reflecting termination of individual apneas with abrupt airway opening. Dyspnea is unusual, and its absence generally distinguishes OSAHS from paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, nocturnal asthma, and acid reflux with laryngospasm. Patients also may describe frequent awakening or sleep disruption, which is more common among women and older adults. The most common daytime symptom is sleepiness. This symptom can be difficult to elicit and may be hard to distinguish from exercise-related fatigue, deconditioning, and malaise. In contrast to true sleepiness, the latter symptoms generally improve with rest. Other symptoms include a dry mouth, nocturnal heartburn, diaphoresis of the chest and neck, nocturia,"

The MSLT measures a patient\u2019s propensity to sleep under quiet conditions. The test is performed after an overnight polysomnogram to establish that the patient has had an adequate amount of good-quality nighttime sleep. The MSLT consists of five 20-min nap opportunities every 2 h across the day. The patient is instructed to try to fall asleep, and the major endpoints are the average latency to sleep and the occurrence of REM sleep during the naps. An average sleep latency across the naps of less than 8 min is considered objective evidence of excessive daytime sleepiness. REM sleep normally occurs only during the nighttime sleep episode, and the occurrence of REM sleep in two or more of the MSLT naps provides support for the diagnosis of narcolepsy."

Another common problem, one seen after as few as one or two drinks shortly before bedtime, is disturbed sleep. Although alcohol might initially help a person fall asleep, it disrupts sleep throughout the rest of the night. The stages of sleep are altered, and time spent in rapid eye movement (REM) and deep sleep is reduced. Alcohol relaxes muscles in the pharynx, which can cause snoring and exacerbate sleep apnea; symptoms of the latter occur in 75% of alcoholic men older than age 60 years. Patients may also experience prominent and sometimes disturbing dreams later in the night. All of these sleep problems are more pronounced in alcoholics, and their persistence may contribute to relapse."

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm. Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed.

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."

He saw his PCP for evaluation of low back pain. X-rays of the spine showed some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine plus several wedge deformities in the thoracic spine. The patient is a long-time smoker (up to two packs per day) and has two to four glasses of wine with dinner, more on the weekends. He has chronic bronchitis, presumably from smoking, and has been treated on numerous occasions with oral prednisone for exacerba-tions of bronchitis. He is currently on 10 mg/d prednisone. Examination shows kyphosis of the thoracic spine, with some tenderness to fist percussion over the thoracic spine. The dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measure-ment of the lumbar spine is \u201cwithin the normal limits,\u201d but the radiologist noted that the reading may be misleading because of degenerative changes.

            "content": "Respiratory dysfunction during sleep is a common, serious cause of excessive daytime sleepiness as well as of disturbed nocturnal sleep. At least 24% of middle-aged men and 9% of middle-aged women in the United States have a reduction or cessation of breathing dozens or more times each night during sleep, with 9% of men and 4% of women doing so more than a hundred times per night. These episodes may be due to an occlusion of the airway (obstructive sleep apnea), absence of respiratory effort (central sleep apnea), or a combination of these factors (mixed sleep apnea). Failure to recognize and treat these conditions appropriately may lead to impairment of daytime alertness, increased risk of sleep-related motor vehicle crashes, depression, hypertension, myocardial infarction, diabetes, stroke, and increased mortality. Sleep apnea is particularly prevalent in overweight men and in the elderly, yet it is estimated to go undiagnosed in most affected individuals. This is unfortunate"

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"
