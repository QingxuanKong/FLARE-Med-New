To determine why a patient might need a tracheostomy, we need to consider the indications and complications of tracheostomy.

This is a common reason for tracheostomy in critically ill patients. Let's analyze the options: A. Repairing vocal cords after paralysis is not a typical indication for tracheostomy. B. Tracheostomy is not primarily used to aid swallowing. C. As an aid to weaning patients from a ventilator is a common indication for tracheostomy, especially in critically ill patients. D.

Tracheobronchial injury resulting in fistulas between the bronchus and conduit may also occur, however rarely. Although this procedure and three-field esophagectomy are fraught with the highest complica-tion rate, the long-term outcome of this procedure provides the greatest survival in many single-center series and retrospective reviews.Three-Field Open Esophagectomy. Three-field open esoph-agectomy is very similar to a minimally invasive three-field except that all access is through open incisions. This proce-dure is preferred by certain Japanese surgeons and LN counts achieved through this kind of operation may run from 45 to 60 LNs. Most Western surgeons question the benefit of such radical surgery when it"

Gastric insuf-flation, secondary to positive pressure ventilation, can occur. Bronchoscopy is diagnostic; with the bronchoscope inserted, the endotracheal tube is withdrawn, and the fistula at the cuff site is exposed. Alternatively, esophagoscopy demonstrates the cuff of the endotracheal tube in the esophagus.Treatment, first and foremost, requires removing tubes from the esophagus and weaning the patient from the ventila-tor. The cuff of the endotracheal tube should be placed below the fistula, avoiding overinflation. To minimize aspiration, a gastrostomy tube should be placed for gastric decompression (to prevent reflux) and a jejunostomy tube for feeding. If aspira-tion persists, esophageal diversion with cervical esophagostomy can be performed. Once weaned from the ventilator, tracheal resection and primary anastomosis, repair of"

Although penetrating injuries may occur throughout the tracheo-bronchial system, blunt injuries most commonly occur within 2.5 cm of the carina. For patients with a massive air leak requir-ing emergent exploration, initial control of the injury to provide effective ventilation is obtained by passing an endotracheal tube either beyond the injury or into the contralateral mainstem bron-chus. Principles of repair are similar to those for repair of cervi-cal tracheal injuries. Devitalized tissue is debrided, and primary end-to-end anastomosis with 3-0 PDS"

            "content": "Infants with mild to moderate tracheomalacia usually require no intervention. Tracheomalacia improves with airway growth as the lumen increases in diameter and the tracheal wall becomes more firm. The treatment of older symptomatic children is geared toward treating any precipitating cause for cough and providing supportive care. Antibiotics may be necessary to treat concurrent infection. Children, especially infants, with severe tracheomalacia may require tracheostomy tubes to administer continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which serves to stent open the airway. Custom-length tracheostomy tubes have been used to stent open the airway when CPAP fails. Surgically placed airway stents are problematic in children because the stents cannot grow and thus serve as a source of fixed stenosis and obstruction. SEE CHAPTER 128."
