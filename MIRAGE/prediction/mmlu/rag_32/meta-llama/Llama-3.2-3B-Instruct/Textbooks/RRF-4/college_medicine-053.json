Carbohydrates are an essential source of energy for high-intensity, short-duration activities. They are broken down into glucose, which is then used by the muscles for energy. Low carbohydrate intake can lead to impaired high-intensity exercise performance because the muscles rely on glucose as a primary energy source. This is especially true for events lasting less than 10 minutes, where anaerobic glycolysis is the primary energy system used. Therefore, low carbohydrate intake can lead to fatigue, decreased performance, and decreased endurance during high-intensity exercise events. Options A and B are incorrect because carbohydrate intake does influence exercise performance, especially in high-intensity events. Option D is also incorrect because low carbohydrate intake actually results in decreased reliance on muscle glycogen during exercise, not increased reliance. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Dietary carbohydrate and blood glucose Some carbohydrate-containing foods produce a rapid rise followed by a steep fall in blood glucose concentration, whereas others result in a gradual rise followed by a slow decline (Fig. 27.18). Thus, they differ in their glycemic response (GR). [Note: Fiber blunts the GR.] The glycemic index (GI) ranks carbohydrate-rich foods on a scale of 0\u2013100 based on the GR they cause relative to the GR caused by the same amount (50 g) of carbohydrate eaten in the form of white bread or glucose. A low GI is <55, whereas a high GI is \u226570. Evidence suggests that a low-GI diet improves glycemic control in diabetic individuals. Food with a low GI tends to create a sense of satiety over a longer period of time and may be helpful in limiting caloric intake. [Note: How much a typical serving size of a food raises blood glucose is referred to as the glycemic load (GL). A food (for example, carrots) can have a high GI and a low GL.] C.

However, this level of intake is usually exceeded. Adults should consume 45%\u201365% of their total calories from carbohydrates.

Given that ~3500 kcal = 1 lb of fat, ~500-kcal restriction daily equates to weight reduction of 1 lb per week. Diets restricted in carbohydrate typically provide a rapid initial weight loss. However, after 1 year, the amount of weight reduction is minimally reduced or no different from that with caloric restriction alone. Thus, adherence to the diet is more important than which diet is chosen. Moreover, there is concern about low-carbohydrate diets enriched in saturated fat, particularly for patients at risk for CVD.

Blood glucose can be obtained from three primary sources: the diet, glycogen degradation, and gluconeogenesis. Dietary intake of glucose and glucose precursors, such as starch (a polysaccharide), disaccharides, and monosaccharides, is sporadic and, depending on the diet, is not always a reliable source of blood glucose. In contrast, gluconeogenesis (see p. 117) can provide sustained synthesis of glucose, but it is somewhat slow in responding to a falling blood glucose level. Therefore, the body has developed mechanisms for storing a supply of glucose in a rapidly mobilized form, namely, glycogen. In the absence of a dietary source"

The biologic properties of dietary fat, carbohydrate, and protein are described below. V. DIETARY FATS The incidence of a number of chronic diseases is significantly influenced by the kinds and amounts of nutrients consumed (Fig. 27.9). Dietary fats most strongly influence the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), but evidence linking dietary fat and the risk for cancer or obesity is much weaker."

The typical coronary care unit diet should provide \u226430% of total calories as fat and have a cholesterol content of \u2264300 mg/d. Complex carbohydrates should make up 50\u201355% of total calories. Portions should not be unusually large, and the menu should be enriched with foods that are high in potassium, magnesium, and fiber, but low in sodium. Diabetes mellitus and hypertriglyceridemia are managed by restriction of concentrated sweets in the diet."

Although the role of diet composition in obesity continues to generate controversy, it appears that high-fat diets may, when combined with simple, rapidly absorbed carbohydrates, promote obesity. Specific genes are likely to influence the response to specific diets, but these genes are largely unidentified."

            "content": "PN formulations provide carbohydrate as hydrous glucose (3.4 kcal/g). In enteral formulas, glucose is the carbohydrate source for so-called monomeric diets. These diets provide protein as amino acids and fat in minimal amounts (3%) to meet essential fatty acid requirements. Monomeric formulas are designed to optimize absorption in the seriously compromised gut. These formulas, like immune-enhancing diets, are expensive. In polymeric diets, the carbohydrate source is usually an osmotically less active polysaccharide, the protein is usually soy or casein protein, and fat is present at concentrations of 25\u201350%. Such formulas are usually well tolerated by patients with normal intestinal length, and some are acceptable for oral consumption."

Therefore, knowledge of the mechanisms of digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, proteins, and other minerals and vitamins is useful in the evaluation of patients with altered intestinal nutrient absorption. Ethnic Group Prevalence of Lactase Deficiency, % Source: From FJ Simoons: Am J Dig Dis 23:963, 1978. Carbohydrates in the diet are present in the form of starch, disaccharides (sucrose and lactose), and glucose. Carbohydrates are absorbed only in the small intestine and only in the form of monosaccharides. Therefore, before their absorption, starch and disaccharides must first be digested by pancreatic amylase and intestinal brush border disaccharidases to monosaccharides. Monosaccharide absorption occurs by a Na-dependent process mediated by the brush border transport protein SGLT1."
