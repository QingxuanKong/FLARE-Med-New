When it comes to prokaryotes, the task becomes harder still: one microscopic rod or sphere looks much like another. Microbiologists have therefore sought to classify prokaryotes in terms of their biochemistry and nutritional requirements. But this approach also has its pitfalls. Amid the bewildering variety of biochemical behaviors, it is difficult to know which differences truly reflect differences of evolutionary history."

The initial studies that led to the classification of the living world into the three domains of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes were based chiefly on analysis of one of the rRNA components of the ribosome. Because the translation of RNA into protein is fundamental to all living cells, this component of the ribosome has been very well conserved since early in the history of life on Earth (Figure 1\u201318). Natural selection has generally favored those prokaryotic cells that can reproduce the fastest by taking up raw materials from their environment and replicating themselves most efficiently, at the maximal rate permitted by the available food supplies. Small size implies a large ratio of surface area to volume, thereby helping to maximize the uptake of nutrients across the plasma membrane and boosting a cell\u2019s reproductive rate."

As Darwin showed, we can readily interpret such close family resemblances in terms of evolution from common ancestors, and we can find the remains of many of these ancestors preserved in the fossil record. In this way, it has been possible to begin to draw a family tree of living organisms, showing the various lines of descent, as well as branch points in the history, where the ancestors of one group of species became different from those of another."

In this way we can begin to take stock of the common inheritance of all living things. There are considerable difficulties in this enterprise. For example, individual species have often lost some of the ancestral genes; other genes have almost certainly been acquired by horizontal transfer from another species and therefore are not truly ancestral, even though shared. In fact, genome comparisons strongly suggest that both lineage-specific gene loss and horizontal gene transfer, in some cases between evolutionarily distant species, have been major factors of evolution, at least among prokaryotes. Finally, in the course of 2 or 3 billion years, some genes that were initially shared will have changed beyond recognition through mutation."

Perhaps the eukaryotic way of life has made large size an advantage: predators typically need to be bigger than their prey, and cell size generally increases in proportion to genome size. Whatever the reason, aided by a massive accumulation of DNA segments derived from parasitic transposable elements (discussed in Chapter 5), the genomes of most eukaryotes have become orders of magnitude larger than those of bacteria and archaea (Figure 1\u201332). The freedom to be extravagant with DNA has had profound implications. Eukaryotes not only have more genes than prokaryotes; they also have vastly more DNA that does not code for protein. The human genome contains 1000 times as many nucleotide pairs as the genome of a typical bacterium, perhaps 10 times as Figure 1\u201331 The origin of chloroplasts."

For example, some simple bacteria have only 500 genes, compared to about 30,000 for humans. Bacteria, archaea, and some single-celled eukaryotes, such as yeast, have concise genomes, consisting of little more than strings of closely packed genes. However, the genomes of multicellular plants and animals, as well as many other eukaryotes, contain, in addition to genes, a large quantity of interspersed DNA whose function is poorly understood (Figure 4\u201313). Some of this additional DNA is crucial for the proper control of gene expression, and this may in part explain why there is so much of it in multicellular organisms, whose genes have to be switched on and off according to complicated rules during development (discussed in Chapters 7 and 21)."

            "content": "Although plants and animals are both eukaryotes, they have evolved separately for more than a billion years. Their last common ancestor is thought to have been a unicellular eukaryote that had mitochondria but no chloroplasts; the plant lineage acquired chloroplasts after plants and animals diverged. The earliest fossils of multicellular animals and plants date from almost 600 million years ago. Thus, it seems that plants and animals evolved multicellularity independently, each starting from a different unicellular eukaryote, some time between 1.6 and 0.6 billion years ago (Figure 15\u201368)."

Nucleotide-sequence analyses suggest that an endosymbiotic oxygen-evolving cyanobacterium (cyan) gave rise to chloroplasts (dark green), while mitochondria arose from an \u03b1-proteobacterium. the nearest relatives of mitochondria (pink) are members of three closely related groups of \u03b1-proteobacteria\u2014the rhizobacteria, agrobacteria, and rickettsias\u2014known to form intimate associations with present-day eukaryotic cells. proteobacteria are pink, purple photosynthetic bacteria are purple, and other photosynthetic bacteria are light green."
