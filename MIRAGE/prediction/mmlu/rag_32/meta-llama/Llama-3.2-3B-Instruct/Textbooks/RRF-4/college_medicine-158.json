    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which process will usually lead to a decrease in gene expression, we need to understand the relationship between histone modifications and gene expression. Histone modifications such as acetylation and methylation can either activate or repress gene expression. Acetylation typically activates gene expression, while methylation typically represses it. Histone deacetylation is the opposite of acetylation, so it would activate gene expression. Therefore, we can eliminate option B. Increased histone acetyltransferase activity would activate gene expression, so we can also eliminate option A. To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the relationship between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Heterochromatin is a more compact, repressed form of chromatin, while euchromatin is a less compact, more accessible form. An increase in the heterochromatin:euchromatin ratio would indicate a decrease in gene expression, as more of the chromatin is in a repressed state. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Bacteria, archaea, and some single-celled eukaryotes, such as yeast, have concise genomes, consisting of little more than strings of closely packed genes. However, the genomes of multicellular plants and animals, as well as many other eukaryotes, contain, in addition to genes, a large quantity of interspersed DNA whose function is poorly understood (Figure 4\u201313). Some of this additional DNA is crucial for the proper control of gene expression, and this may in part explain why there is so much of it in multicellular organisms, whose genes have to be switched on and off according to complicated rules during development (discussed in Chapters 7 and 21)."

The cell cycle is briefly summarized in Figure 4\u201317, and it is discussed in detail in Chapter 17. Briefly, during a long interphase, genes are expressed and chromosomes are replicated, with the two replicas remaining together as a pair of sister chromatids.

But other controls can act later in the pathway from DNA to protein to modulate the amount of gene product that is made\u2014and in some cases, to determine the exact amino acid sequence of the protein product. These post-transcriptional controls, which operate after RNA polymerase has bound to the gene\u2019s promoter and has begun RNA synthesis, are crucial for the regulation of many genes.

As discussed in Chapter 4, eukaryotic chromosomes are composed of roughly equal mixtures of DNA and protein. Chromosome duplication therefore requires not only the replication of DNA, but also the synthesis and assembly of new chromosomal proteins onto the DNA behind each replication fork. Although we are far from understanding this process in detail, we are beginning to learn how the fundamental unit of chromatin packaging, the nucleosome, is duplicated. The cell requires a large amount of new histone protein, approximately equal in mass to the newly synthesized DNA, to make the new nucleosomes in each cell cycle. For this reason, most eukaryotic organisms possess multiple copies of the gene for each histone. Vertebrate cells, for example, have about 20 repeated gene sets, most containing the genes that encode all five histones (H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4)."

In addition, assume that the nucleus is 500 times the volume of the bacterium, and has 500 times as much DNA.

But in the intervening years, scientists have discovered the elegant mechanisms involved. The translation of genetic information from the 4-letter alphabet of polynucleotides into the 20-letter alphabet of proteins is a complex process. The rules of this translation seem in some respects neat and rational but in other respects strangely arbitrary, given that they are (with minor exceptions) identical in all living things. These arbitrary features, it is thought, reflect frozen accidents in the early history of life.

Transcription regulators bind to these sequences, which are dispersed throughout genomes, and this binding puts into motion a series of reactions that ultimately specify which genes are to be transcribed and at what rate.

Because all DNA molecules consist of an approximately equal mixture of the same four nucleotides, they cannot be readily separated, as proteins can, on the basis of their different charges and biochemical properties.

            "content": "A complete DNA sequence reveals both the genes an organism possesses and the genes it lacks. When we compare the three domains of the living world, we can begin to see which genes are common to all of them and must therefore have been present in the cell that was ancestral to all present-day living things, and which genes are peculiar to a single branch in the tree of life. To explain the findings, however, we need to consider a little more closely how new genes arise and genomes evolve. The raw material of evolution is the DNA sequence that already exists: there is no natural mechanism for making long stretches of new random sequence. In this sense, no gene is ever entirely new. Innovation can, however, occur in several ways (Figure 1\u201319): 1. Intragenic mutation: an existing gene can be randomly modified by changes in its DNA sequence, through various types of error that occur mainly in the process of DNA replication. 2."

            "content": "Methods based on mass spectrometry (see pp. 455\u2013457) provide much more detailed information, including the identity of each protein, the position of each modification, and the nature of the modification. (Courtesy of tim Myers and leigh Anderson, large Scale Biology Corporation.) The genome of a cell contains in its DNA sequence the information to make many thousands of different protein and RNA molecules. A cell typically expresses only a fraction of its genes, and the different types of cells in multicellular organisms arise because different sets of genes are expressed. Moreover, cells can change the pattern of genes they express in response to changes in their environment, such as signals from other cells. Although all of the steps involved in expressing a gene can in principle be regulated, for most genes the initiation of RNA transcription provides the most important point of control."

            "content": "As discussed above, it was known well before the structure of DNA was determined that genes contain the instructions for producing proteins. If genes are made of DNA, the DNA must therefore somehow encode proteins (Figure 4\u20137). As discussed in Chapter 3, the properties of a protein, which are responsible for its biological function, are determined by its three-dimensional structure. This structure is determined in turn by the linear sequence of the amino acids of which it is composed. The linear sequence of nucleotides in a gene must therefore somehow spell out the linear sequence of amino acids in a protein. The exact correspondence between the four-letter nucleotide alphabet of DNA and the twenty-letter amino acid alphabet of proteins\u2014the genetic code\u2014is not at all obvious from the DNA structure, and it took over a decade after the discovery of the double helix before it was worked out. In Chapter 6, we will describe this code in detail in the course of elaborating the process of"

            "content": "A gene is a nucleotide sequence in a DNA molecule that acts as a functional unit for the production of a protein, a structural RNA, or a catalytic or regulatory RNA molecule. In eukaryotes, protein-coding genes are usually composed of a string of alternating introns and exons associated with regulatory regions of DNA. A chromosome is formed from a single, enormously long DNA molecule that contains a linear array of many genes, bound to a large set of proteins. The human genome contains 3.2 \u00d7 109 DNA nucleotide pairs, divided between 22 different autosomes (present in two copies each) and 2 sex chromosomes. Only a small percentage of this DNA codes for proteins or functional RNA molecules. A chromosomal DNA molecule also contains three other types of important nucleotide sequences: replication origins and telomeres allow the DNA molecule to be efficiently replicated, while a centromere attaches the sister DNA molecules to the mitotic spindle, ensuring their accurate segregation to"
