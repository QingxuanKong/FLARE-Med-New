    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the key points from the provided documents. The patient is a 15-year-old male presenting with painless swelling in the left testicle that has varied in size over several months. The lesion transilluminates well, and no inguinal nodes are palpable. The testicular scan is normal. Given these details, the likely diagnosis is a hydrocele, which is a collection of fluid around the testicle that can cause swelling. Since the lesion transilluminates well, this supports the diagnosis of a hydrocele. The normal testicular scan and lack of inguinal nodes also support this diagnosis. The most appropriate management for a hydrocele in this age group is watchful waiting, but since the patient is seeking medical attention, surgical repair may be considered. However, the options provided do not include surgical repair, so we need to consider the other options. Injection with a sclerosing agent (A) is not typically used for hydroceles. Needle aspiration (B) may be considered if the diagnosis is uncertain, but it is not the first-line management for a hydrocele. Needle biopsy (C) is not typically performed for a hydrocele. Given the information provided, the most appropriate management is not explicitly listed, but among the options, watchful waiting is implied, but since that is not an option, we can deduce the correct answer by elimination. The other options are not suitable for the given scenario, so the correct answer can be deduced by elimination and understanding of the condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

More commonly, patients present with testicular discomfort or swelling suggestive of epididymitis and/or orchitis. In this circumstance, a trial of antibiotics is reasonable. However, if symptoms persist or a residual abnormality remains, then testicular ultrasound examination is indicated. Ultrasound of the testis is indicated whenever a testicular malignancy is considered and for persistent or painful testicular swelling. If a testicular mass is detected, a radical inguinal orchiectomy should be performed. Because the testis develops from the gonadal ridge, its blood supply and lymphatic drainage originate in the abdomen and descend with the testis into the scrotum.

Most patients present with testicular pain or a testicular mass. Respiratory symptoms, back pain, weight loss, or gynecomastia may indicate metastatic disease (10\u201320%). A testicular mass is considered malignant till proven otherwise. Similarly, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy in young men should be considered metastatic testicular cancer.Standard initial workup includes scrotal ultrasound (Fig. 40-8) and serum tumor markers (\u03b1-fetoprotein, quanti-tative human chorionic gonadotropin, and lactate dehydroge-nase).

In adults, most commonly in retroperitoneum, mediastinum, pineal, and tumors suprasellar regions. In infants and young children, sacrococcygeal teratomas are most common.

Cryptorchidism is associated with an \u2191 risk of neoplasia in both testes. Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome is also a risk factor. Testicular cancer is the most common malignancy in males 15\u201334 years of age. \u03b2-hCG in men = choriocarcinoma. Patients most often present with painless enlargement of the testes. Most testicular cancers occur between ages 15 and 30, but seminomas have a peak incidence between 40 and 50 years of age. Testicular ultrasound. CXR and abdominal/pelvic CT to evaluate for metastasis. Tumor markers are useful for diagnosis and in monitoring treatment response. \u03b2-hCG is always elevated in choriocarcinoma and is elevated in 10% of seminomas."

Boys with pubertal delay may have accompanying emotional and physical immaturity relative to their peers, which can be a source of anxiety. Physical examination should focus on height; arm span; weight; visual fields; and secondary sex characteristics, including hair growth, testicular volume, phallic size, and scrotal reddening and thinning. Testicular size >2.5 cm generally indicates that the child has entered puberty."

It may be quite difficult to clinically differenti-ate the two entities, but one should keep in mind that the onset of torsion tends to be slightly more acute (within 4\u20138 hours) than that of epididymo-orchitis (which generally arises over the course of 24\u201348 hours). Scrotal ultrasound can assist in diagnosis; how-ever, in cases of severe orchitis, testicular flow can be compro-mised, which may raise concern for torsion. Scrotal exploration should be considered in any equivocal case: a missed torsion can result in testicular loss secondary to necrosis.Treatment of epididymo-orchitis consists of single dose of ceftriaxone and azithromycin if there is concern for sexu-ally transmitted infection, as well as 14 days of oral antibiotic therapy, NSAIDs, and"

Persistence of symptoms after a course of therapy for epididymitis suggests the possibility of testicular tumor or of a chronic granulomatous disease, such as tuberculosis. In sexually active men under age 35, acute epididymitis is caused most frequently by C. trachomatis and less commonly by N. gonorrhoeae and is usually associated with overt or subclinical urethritis. Acute epididymitis occurring in older men or following urinary tract instrumentation is usually caused by urinary pathogens. Similarly, epididymitis in men who have practiced insertive rectal intercourse is often caused by Enterobacteriaceae. These older men usually have no urethritis but do have bacteriuria."
