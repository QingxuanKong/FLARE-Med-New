    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to apply Bernoulli's principle of fluid dynamics to the circulatory system. According to Bernoulli's principle, the sum of the pressure, kinetic energy, and potential energy of a fluid remains constant along a streamline in a steady, inviscid flow. Mathematically, this is expressed as P + 0.5\\rho v^2 + \\rho gy = constant, where P is the pressure, \\rho is the fluid density, v is the fluid velocity, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. In the context of the circulatory system, the pressure head is the dominant factor, and the kinetic energy and potential energy can be neglected. The pressure head is the sum of the hydrostatic pressure and the dynamic pressure. The hydrostatic pressure is the pressure exerted by a fluid at equilibrium at a given point of the fluid due to the force of gravity. The dynamic pressure is the pressure exerted by the fluid due to its velocity. In the circulatory system, the dynamic pressure is related to the flow velocity by the continuity equation, which states that the product of the cross-sectional area and the flow velocity is constant. In this case, we can use Poiseuille's law to relate the flow velocity to the cross-sectional area. According to Poiseuille's law, the flow velocity is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the tube. Since the cross-sectional area is proportional to the square of the radius, the flow velocity is inversely proportional to the square of the radius. Therefore, if the cross-sectional area of the capillary in the neck is equal to that of the capillary in the right knee, the flow velocity in the neck capillary will be greater than in the knee capillary. Since the hydrostatic pressure is directly proportional to the flow velocity, the pressure in the neck capillary will be greater than in the knee capillary. Thus, the pressure in the neck is greater than the pressure in the knee because of the increase in pressure head.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Because conservation of mass requires that the fluid flowing through a rigid tube be constant, the velocity of the fluid varies inversely with the cross-sectional area. Thus fluid flow velocity is greatest in the section of the tube with the smallest cross-sectional area and slowest in the section of the tube with the greatest cross-sectional area. Fig. 15.3 , velocity decreases progressively as blood traverses the arterial system. In the capillaries, velocity decreases to a minimal value. As the blood then passes centrally through the venous system toward the heart, velocity progressively increases again.

The total cross-sectional area of the capillary bed is very large despite the fact that the cross-sectional area of each capillary is less than that of each arteriole. As a result, blood flow velocity becomes quite slow in the capillaries (see Fig. 15.3 ), which is analogous to the decrease in velocity of flow in the wide regions of a river. Conditions in the capillaries are ideal for the exchange of diffusible substances between blood and tissue because capillaries consist of short tubes with walls that are only one cell thick and in which flow velocity is low. On its return to the heart from the capillaries, blood passes through venules and then through veins of increasing size. Pressure within these vessels progressively decreases until the blood reaches the right atrium (see Fig. 15.3 ).

A given change in Pv produces a greater effect on capillary hydrostatic pressure than does the same change in Pa. Approximately 80% of an increase in Pv is transmitted back to the capillaries. Capillary hydrostatic pressure (Pc) varies from tissue to tissue. Average values, obtained from direct measurements in human skin, are approximately 32 mm Hg at the arterial end of capillaries and approximately 15 mm Hg at the venous end of capillaries at the level of the heart (see Fig. 17.28 ). As discussed previously, when a person stands, hydrostatic pressure increases in the legs and decreases in the head. Tissue pressure, or, more specifically, interstitial fluid pressure (Pi) outside the capillaries, opposes capillary filtration. The difference between Pc and Pi constitutes the driving force for filtration. Normally, Pi is close to zero, and so Pc essentially represents the hydrostatic driving force."

He was interested primarily in the physical determinants of blood flow, but he replaced blood with simpler liquids in his measurements of flow through glass capillary tubes.

Poiseuille\u2019s law applies to the steady (i.e., nonpulsatile) laminar flow of newtonian fluids through rigid cylindrical tubes.

The fifteen years of discoveries that shaped molecular electrophysiology: time for appraisal. Circ Res. 2010;107: 451. Upon completion of this chapter, the student should be able to answer the following questions: 1. What physical properties of blood vessels and blood determine hemodynamics, and how are they defined by Poiseuille\u2019s law? 2. How is arterial compliance related to stroke volume and pulse pressure? How does arterial compliance affect the arterial pulse wave and cardiac work? 3. What are mean, systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures, and how are they measured? 4. What vessels constitute the microcirculation? How is pulsatile blood flow in large arteries converted into steady flow in the microcirculation? 5. What are the hydrostatic and osmotic factors that underlie Starling\u2019s hypothesis for capillary function? 6."

The principal determinant of resistance to blood flow through any vessel is the caliber of the vessel because resistance varies inversely as the fourth power of the radius of the tube. In"

A higher maximal level of cardiac output is attainable when the arterioles are dilated than when they are constricted (see Fig. 19.5). Cardiac output and venous return are tightly linked. Except for small, transient disparities, the heart cannot pump any more blood than is delivered to it through the venous system. Similarly, because the circulatory system is a closed circuit, venous return to the heart must equal cardiac output over any appreciable time interval. The flow around the entire closed circuit depends on the capability of the pump, the characteristics of the circuit, and the total fluid volume of the system."

The physiological factors are cardiac output (which equals heart rate \u00d7 stroke volume) and peripheral resistance. To estimate Pa from an arterial blood pressure tracing, the area under the pressure curve is divided by the time interval involved (see Fig. 17.13 ). Alternatively, Pa can be approximated from the measured values of systolic pressure (Ps) and diastolic pressure (Pd) by means of the following formula: Equation 17.14"

            "content": "Fig. 17.3A ). In the case of laminar flow through a tube, the fluid consists of a series of infinitesimally thin concentric tubes sliding past one another, of which the central tube has the highest velocity. The velocities of the concentric laminae decrease parabolically towards the vessel wall. Despite the differences between the vascular system (i.e., flow is pulsatile, the vessels are not rigid cylinders, and blood is not a newtonian fluid), Poiseuille\u2019s law does provide valuable insight into the determinants of blood flow through the vascular system. In certain unusual situations, however, flow can become turbulent (see Fig. 17.3B ), rather than laminar. Under these conditions, vortices (swirls) are present, and the distribution of flow velocities is chaotic. This condition is described in more detail later in this chapter."
