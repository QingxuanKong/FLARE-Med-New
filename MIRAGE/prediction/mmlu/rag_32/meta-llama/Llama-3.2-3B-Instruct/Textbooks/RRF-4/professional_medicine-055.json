    "question": "A 33-year-old male physician reports for a shift in the emergency department. A nurse alerts you that he noticed a faint odor of alcohol near the physician. When approached, the physician appears tired and more disheveled than usual. There is an odor of alcohol on his breath. He is a skilled and talented physician with no known history of substance or alcohol use disorder. He is married with three children, and his wife is pregnant with twins. The physician was recently hired and has had no actions on his license by any state medical board. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Ask the physician if he is sober, and if he says yes, allow him to complete his shift",
        "B": "Explain to the physician that you suspect he is intoxicated and ask him to submit to a blood sample to check his blood alcohol concentration",
        "C": "Relieve the physician of duty and alert the hospital's patient safety officer",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The scenario presents a situation where a physician is suspected of being intoxicated on the job, which raises concerns about patient safety. The nurse's observation of the physician's appearance and behavior, including a faint odor of alcohol, is a red flag. The physician's denial of intoxication does not necessarily rule out the possibility of impairment. The physician's role is to provide medical care, and being intoxicated could compromise their ability to make sound judgments and provide appropriate care. The hospital's patient safety policies and procedures should be followed to ensure the well-being of patients. Relieving the physician of duty and alerting the hospital's patient safety officer is the most appropriate next step to address the situation and ensure patient safety. This action also allows for a thorough investigation and potential disciplinary action if necessary. Asking the physician if they are sober or allowing them to submit to a blood sample may not be sufficient to address the potential risk to patients. Covering the remainder of the shift alone is not a suitable solution, as it does not address the underlying issue and may compromise patient care.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Between 8:30 and approximately midnight, he and several other pledges consumed beer and a bottle of whiskey, and then he consumed most of a bottle of rum at the urging of upperclassmen. The young man complained of feeling nau-seated, lay down on a couch, and began to lose conscious-ness. Two upperclassmen carried him to a bedroom, placed him on his stomach, and positioned a trash can nearby. Approximately 10 minutes later, the freshman was found unconscious and covered with vomit. There was a delay in treatment because the upperclassmen called the college police instead of calling 911. After the call was transferred to 911, emergency medical technicians responded quickly and discovered that the young man was not breathing and that he had choked on his vomit. He was rushed to the hospital, where he remained in a coma for 2 days before ultimately being pronounced dead. The"

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

            "content": "A 45-year-old man with no significant medical history was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 10 days ago after suffering third-degree burns over 40% of his body. He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

A patient may waive the right to confidentiality (e.g., with insurance companies). It is ethically and legally necessary to override confidentiality in the following situations: Patient intent to commit a violent crime (Tarasoff decision): Physicians have a duty to protect the intended victim through reasonable means (e.g., warn the victim, notify police). Suicidal patients. Child and elder abuse. Reportable infectious diseases (duty to warn public officials and identifiable people at risk). Gunshot and knife wounds (duty to notify the police). Impaired automobile drivers. Example: A patient begins to drive one week after hospitalization for seizures, although the department of motor vehicles in his state requires that licensed drivers be seizure free for at least three months."

            "content": "Mark von Zastrow, MD, PhD* A 51-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to acute difficulty breathing. The patient is afebrile and normotensive but anxious, tachycardic, and markedly tachy-pneic. Auscultation of the chest reveals diffuse wheezes. The physician provisionally makes the diagnosis of bronchial asthma and administers epinephrine by intramuscular injec-tion, improving the patient\u2019s breathing over several minutes. A normal chest X-ray is subsequently obtained, and the medical history is remarkable only for mild hypertension that is being treated with propranolol. The physician instructs the patient to discontinue use of propranolol, and changes the patient\u2019s antihypertensive medication to verapamil. Why is the physician correct to discontinue propranolol? Why is verapamil a better choice for managing hypertension in this patient? What alternative treatment change might the physi-cian consider?"

Hx/PE: See Table 2.14-10 for the symptoms of intoxication and withdrawal. Look for palmar erythema or telangiectasias as well as for other signs and symptoms of end-organ complications. Dx: Screen with the CAGE questionnaire. Monitor vital signs for evidence of withdrawal. Labs may reveal \u2191 LFTs, LDH, and MCV. Tx: Rule out medical complications; correct electrolyte abnormalities. Start a benzodiazepine taper for withdrawal symptoms. Add haloperidol for hallucinations and psychotic symptoms. Pinpoint pupils are not always a reliable sign of opioid ingestion because coingestions can lead to normal or enlarged pupils. Also look for a \u2193 respiratory rate, track marks, and \u2193breath sounds. CAGE questionnaire: 1. Have you ever felt the need to Cut down on your drinking? 2. Have you ever felt Annoyed by criticism of your drinking? 3."
