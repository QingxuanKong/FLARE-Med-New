Additionally, Document [6] states that during aerobic glycolysis, 2 NADH are produced, and each NADH donates 3 ATP in the ETC. So, the net gain of ATP from NADH is 2 \\u00301 ATP.

Oxidative decarboxylation to acetyl CoA Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate by the PDHC is an important pathway in tissues with a high oxidative capacity such as cardiac muscle (Fig. 8.24). PDHC irreversibly converts pyruvate, the end product of aerobic glycolysis, into acetyl CoA, a TCA cycle substrate (see p. 109) and the carbon source for fatty acid synthesis (see p. 183). B. Carboxylation to oxaloacetate Carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase is a biotin-dependent reaction (see Fig. 8.24). This irreversible reaction is important because it replenishes the TCA cycle intermediate and provides substrate for gluconeogenesis (see p. 118). C. Reduction to ethanol (microorganisms)"

Correct answer = B. During a 2-day fast, glycogen stores are depleted, and gluconeogenesis maintains blood glucose. This is an energy-requiring (endergonic) pathway (both ATP and GTP get hydrolyzed) that occurs primarily in the liver, with the kidneys becoming major glucose producers in prolonged fasting. Gluconeogenesis uses both mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes and is stimulated by a fall in the insulin/glucagon ratio. Fatty acid degradation yields acetyl coenzyme A (CoA), which cannot be converted to glucose. This is because there is no net gain of carbons from acetyl CoA in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is physiologically irreversible. It is the carbon skeletons of most amino acids that are glucogenic."

Biotin: PC requires the coenzyme biotin (see p. 385) covalently bound to the \u03b5-amino group of a lysine residue in the enzyme (see Fig. 10.3). ATP hydrolysis drives formation of an enzyme\u2013biotin\u2013carbon dioxide (CO2) intermediate, which then carboxylates pyruvate to form OAA. [Note: HCO3\u2212 provides the CO2.] The PC reaction occurs in the mitochondria of liver and kidney cells and has two purposes: to allow production of PEP, an important substrate for gluconeogenesis, and to provide OAA that can replenish the TCA cycle intermediates that may become depleted. Muscle cells also contain PC but use the OAA product only for the replenishment (anaplerotic) purpose and do not synthesize glucose. [Note: Pyruvate carrier protein moves pyruvate from the cytosol into mitochondria.]"

            "content": "Regulation of the activity of the irreversible glycolytic enzymes by allosteric activation/inhibition or covalent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is short term (that is, the effects occur over minutes or hours). Superimposed on these effects on the activity of preexisting enzyme molecules are the long-term hormonal effects on the number of new enzyme molecules. These hormonal effects can result in 10-to 20-fold increases in enzyme synthesis that typically occur over hours to days. Regular consumption of meals rich in carbohydrate or administration of insulin initiates an increase in the amount of glucokinase, PFK-1, and PK in the liver (Fig. 8.23). The change reflects an increase in gene transcription, resulting in increased enzyme synthesis. Increased availability of these three enzymes favors the conversion of glucose to pyruvate, a characteristic of the absorptive state (see p. 321).
