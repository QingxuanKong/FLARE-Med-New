    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the function of the cervical sympathetic chain and its impact on the body's autonomic functions. The cervical sympathetic chain is responsible for controlling various autonomic functions such as pupillary constriction, facial vasodilation, and sweating. A damage to the cervical sympathetic chain would disrupt these functions. Pupillary constriction is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, so a disruption in this pathway would result in miosis (pupillary constriction). Facial vasodilation is also controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, so a disruption would result in vasoconstriction of facial vessels. Facial sweating is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, so a disruption would result in decreased facial sweating. Lacrimation (tear production) is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system, so a disruption would not affect lacrimation. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that includes pupillary constriction, vasodilation of facial vessels, and decreased facial sweating. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

            "content": "Sympathetically Maintained Pain Patients with peripheral nerve injury occasionally develop spontaneous pain in the region innervated by the nerve. This pain is often described as having a burning quality. The pain typically begins after a delay of hours to days or even weeks and is accompanied by swelling of the extremity, periarticular bone loss, and arthritic changes in the distal joints. The pain may be relieved by a local anesthetic block of the sympathetic innervation to the affected extremity. Damaged primary afferent nociceptors acquire adrenergic sensitivity and can be activated by stimulation of the sympathetic outflow. This constellation of spontaneous pain and signs of sympathetic dysfunction following injury has been termed complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). When this occurs after an identifiable nerve injury, it is termed CRPS type II (also known as posttraumatic neuralgia or, if severe, causalgia).

When a similar clinical picture appears without obvious nerve injury, it is termed CRPS type I (also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy). CRPS can be produced by a variety of injuries, including fractures of bone, soft tissue trauma, myocardial infarction, and stroke (Chap. 446). CRPS type I typically resolves with symptomatic treatment; however, when it persists, detailed examination often reveals evidence of peripheral nerve injury. Although the pathophysiology of CRPS is poorly understood, the pain and the signs of inflammation, when acute, can be rapidly relieved by blocking the sympathetic nervous system. This implies that sympathetic activity can activate undamaged nociceptors when inflammation is present. Signs of sympathetic hyperactivity should be sought in patients with post-traumatic pain and inflammation and no other obvious explanation."

            "content": "Preganglionic sympathetic fibers arise from the upper segments of the thoracic spinal cord, mainly T1. They enter the sympathetic chain through white rami communicantes, and ascend to the superior cervical ganglion where they synapse with postganglionic sympathetic fibers. The postganglionic fibers are distributed along the internal carotid artery and its branches. The postganglionic sympathetic fibers destined for the orbit travel with the ophthalmic artery. Once in the orbit the fibers are distributed to the eyeball either by: passing through the ciliary ganglion, without synapsing, and joining the short ciliary nerves, which pass from the ganglion to the eyeball; or passing through long ciliary nerves to reach the eyeball. In the eyeball postganglionic sympathetic fibers innervate the dilator pupillae muscle."

            "content": "Atrophic, areflexic paralysis of muscles of the trunk and limbs relates, of course, to destruction of neurons in the anterior and intermediate horns of the corresponding segments of the spinal cord gray matter. The affected regions can be quite focal or scattered, giving rise, for instance, to permanent paralysis of only one limb. Stiffness and pain in the neck and back, attributed to \u201cmeningeal irritation,\u201d are probably related to the mild inflammatory exudate in the meninges and to the generally mild lesions in the dorsal root ganglia and dorsal horns. These lesions also account for the muscle pain and paresthesia in parts that later become paralyzed. Abnormalities of autonomic function are attributable to lesions of autonomic pathways in the reticular substance of the brainstem and in the lateral horn cells in the spinal cord."

Extension or bend-ing stretches the carotid over the bony transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, while seat belt injuries cause direct trauma. Symptoms of cervical carotid dissection include con-tralateral neurologic deficit from brain ischemia, headache, and ipsilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome from disruption of the sympa-thetic tracts ascending from the stellate ganglion on the surface of the carotid artery.
