At higher doses, a vasoconstrictor effect results from \u03b1-receptor stimulation.

In other instances, a low dose of carbidopa plus levodopa (eg, Sinemet-25/100 three times daily) is introduced, and a dopamine agonist is then added. In either case, the dose of the dopamine agonist is built up gradually depending on response and tolerance.

The theoretical basis for the use of this compound rests on the observation that striatal dopamine is depleted in patients with Parkinson disease but that the remaining diseased nigral cells are still capable of producing some dopamine by taking up its precursor, l-dopa. The number of neurons in the striatum is not diminished and they remain receptive to ingested dopamine acting through the residual nigral neurons. Over time, however, the number of remaining nigral neurons becomes inadequate and the receptivity to dopamine of the striatal target neurons becomes excessive, possibly as a result of denervation hypersensitivity; this results in both a reduced response to l-dopa and to paradoxical and excessive movements (dyskinesias) with each dose."

Striatal dopamine levels are normally maintained at a relatively constant level. In PD, dopamine neurons degenerate and striatal dopamine is dependent on the peripheral availability of levodopa. Intermittent doses of short-acting levodopa result in fluctuating plasma levels because of variability in transit of the drug from the stomach to the duodenum where it is absorbed and the short half-life of the drug. This variability results in exposure of dopamine receptors to pathologically high and low concentrations of dopamine. It has been hypothesized that more continuous delivery of levodopa might prevent the development of motor complications. Indeed, a recent controlled study demonstrated that continuous intraintestinal infusion of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (Duodopa) is associated with significant improvement in \u201coff\u201d time and in \u201con\u201d time"

            "content": "long-acting, are less prone than levodopa to induce dyskinesia. For this reason, many physicians initiate therapy with a dopamine agonist, although supplemental levodopa is eventually required in virtually all patients. Both ropinirole and pramipexole are available as orally administered immediate (tid) and extended-release (qd) formulations. Rotigotine is administered as a once-daily transdermal patch. Apomorphine is a dopamine agonist with efficacy comparable to levodopa, but it must be administered parenterally and has a very short half-life and duration of activity (45 min). It is generally administered by injection as a rescue agent for the treatment of severe \u201coff\u201d episodes. Apomorphine can also be administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion and has been demonstrated to reduce both \u201coff\u201d time and dyskinesia in advanced patients. However, this approach has not been approved in the United States."

            "content": "Subcutaneous injection of apomorphine hydrochloride (Apokyn), a potent nonergoline dopamine agonist that interacts with post-synaptic D2 receptors in the caudate nucleus and putamen, is effective for the temporary relief (\u201crescue\u201d) of off-periods of akinesia in patients on optimized dopaminergic therapy. It is rapidly taken up in the blood and then the brain, leading to clinical benefit that begins within about 10 minutes of injection and persists for up to 2 hours. The optimal dose is identified by administering increasing test doses until adequate benefit is achieved or a maximum of 0.6 mL (6 mg) is reached, with the supine and standing blood pressures monitored before injection and then every 20 minutes for an hour after it. Most patients require a dose of 0.3\u20130.6 mL (3\u20136 mg), and this should be given usually no more than about three times daily, but occasionally up to five times daily."

Dopamine agonist therapy may be associated with development of impulse control disorders. Gabapentin is effective in reducing the severity of restless legs syndrome and is taken once or twice daily (in the evening and before sleep). The starting dose is 300 mg daily, building up depending on response and tolerance (to approximately 1800 mg daily). Oral gabapentin enacarbil (600 or 1200 mg once daily) may also be helpful. A recent study suggests that pregabalin, a related drug, is also effective at a daily total dosage of 150\u2013300 mg, taken in divided doses. Clonazepam, 1 mg daily, is also sometimes helpful, especially for those with intermittent symptoms. When opiates are required, those with long half-lives or low addictive potential should be used. Oxycodone is often effective; the dose is individualized."

            "content": "Treatment is with drugs that block dopamine receptors or deplete dopamine stores, such as fluphenazine, pimozide, and tetrabenazine. These drugs reduce the frequency and intensity of tics by about 60%. Pimozide, a dopamine receptor antagonist, may be helpful in patients as a first-line treatment or in those who are either unresponsive to or intolerant of the other agents mentioned. Treatment is started at 1 mg/d, and the dosage is increased by 1 mg every 5 days; most patients require 7\u201316 mg/d. It has similar side effects to haloperidol but may cause irregularities of cardiac rhythm. Haloperidol has been used for many years to treat tic disorders. Patients are better able to tolerate this drug if treatment is started with a small dosage (eg, 0.25 or 0.5 mg daily) and then increased gradually (eg, by 0.25 mg every 4 or 5 days) over the following weeks depending on response and tolerance. Most patients ultimately require a total daily dose of 3\u20138 mg. Adverse effects include"

If abruptly discontinued, the patient may become totally immobilized by a sudden and severe increase of tremor and rigidity; rarely, a neuroleptic syndrome, sometimes fatal, has been induced by such withdrawal. Reducing the medication dose over a week or so is usually adequate."

Management involves the close regulation of dopaminergic intake. Punding designates the performance of stereotyped, complex, but purposeless motor activity, such as sorting or lining up various objects or repetitive grooming behavior. It responds to reduction in dose of dopaminergic agents or to atypical antipsychotic agents. D. Dyskinesias and Response Fluctuations"
