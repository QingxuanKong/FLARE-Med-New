    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of cell motility and the components involved in it. Cell motility refers to the ability of cells to move, and in the context of a cultured fibroblast, it encompasses various processes such as protrusion, adhesion, and contraction. Let's examine each option to determine which one does not belong to the concept of cell motility.\\n\\nA. Adhesion plaques: Adhesion plaques, also known as focal adhesions, are dynamic assemblies of structural and signaling proteins that link the cell to the extracellular matrix. They play a crucial role in cell motility by providing the necessary forces to move the cell forward. Therefore, adhesion plaques are indeed involved in cell motility.\\n\\nB. Vinculin: Vinculin is a protein that is part of the adhesion plaque complex and helps to regulate the formation and dynamics of focal adhesions. It is involved in cell motility, so vinculin is also a part of the concept.\\n\\nC. Clathrin: Clathrin is a protein involved in the formation of coated vesicles, which are involved in endocytosis and other cellular processes. While clathrin is essential for many cellular functions, it is not directly involved in cell motility. Clathrin is more related to the formation of vesicles and endocytosis rather than the movement of the cell itself.\\n\\nD. Lamellipodia: Lamellipodia are dynamic structures formed by actin filaments that extend from the leading edge of a cell and are involved in cell protrusion and movement. They are a key component of cell motility, so lamellipodia are indeed involved in the concept of cell motility.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is C. Clathrin, as it is not directly involved in cell motility but rather in other cellular processes such as endocytosis and vesicle formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

After the chromosomes have replicated, the interphase microtubule array that spreads throughout the cytoplasm is reconfigured into the bipolar mitotic spindle, which segregates the two copies of each chromosome into daughter nuclei. At the same time, the specialized actin structures that enable the fibroblast to crawl across the surface of the dish rearrange so that the cell stops moving and assumes a more spherical shape. Actin and its associated motor protein myosin then form a belt around the middle of the cell, the contractile ring, which constricts like a tiny muscle to pinch the cell in two. When division is complete, the cytoskeletons of the two daughter fibroblasts reassemble into their interphase structures to convert the two rounded-up daughter cells into smaller versions of the flattened,"

They are dispersed in connective tissue throughout the body, where they secrete a nonrigid extracellular matrix that is rich in type I or type III collagen, or both, as discussed in Chapter 19. When a tissue is injured, the fibroblasts nearby proliferate, migrate into the wound (Movie 22.1), and produce large amounts of collagenous matrix that helps to isolate and repair the damaged tissue. Their ability to thrive in the face of injury, together with their solitary lifestyle, may explain why fibroblasts are the easiest of cells to grow in culture\u2014a feature that has made them a favorite subject for cell biological studies."

Thus, when fibroblasts are mixed with a meshwork of randomly oriented collagen fibrils that form a gel in a culture dish, the fibroblasts tug on the meshwork, drawing in collagen from their surroundings and thereby causing the gel to contract to a small fraction of its initial volume. By similar activities, a cluster of fibroblasts surrounds itself with a capsule of densely packed and circumferentially oriented collagen fibers."

Most obviously, a mutation or epigenetic change can confer such an advantage by increasing the rate at which a clone of cells proliferates or by enabling it to continue proliferating when normal cells would stop. Cancer cells that can be grown in culture, or cultured cells artificially engineered to contain the types of mutations encountered in cancers, typically show a transformed phenotype. They are abnormal in their shape, their motility, their responses to growth factors in the culture medium, and, most characteristically, in the way they react to contact with the substratum and with one another.

Although movement is driven primarily by actin polymerization and myosin contractility, septins and intermediate filaments also participate. For example, vimentin intermediate filament networks associate with integrins at focal adhesions, and vimentin-deficient fibroblasts display impaired mechanical stability, migration, and contractile capacity. Furthermore, disruption of linker proteins that connect different cytoskeletal elements, including several plakins and KASH proteins, leads to defects in cell polarization and migration. Thus, interactions among cytoplasmic filament systems, as well as mechanical linkage to the nucleus, are required for complex, whole-cell behaviors such as migration."

These extend in three dimensions and are important for cells to cross tissue barriers, as when a metastatic cancer cell invades the surrounding tissue.

Large clones of progeny can be generated in this way from single ancestral stromal cells. Depending on the culture conditions, the members of such a clone either can continue proliferating to produce more cells of the same type, or can differentiate as fat cells, cartilage cells, or bone cells. The fate of the cells depends on physical as well as chemical signals: embedded in a stiff, unyielding matrix, they tend to turn into bone cells, whereas in a softer, more elastic matrix, they tend to turn into fat cells. This effect is mediated by an intracellular pathway that responds to tension in actin\u2013myosin bundles and relays a signal to specific transcription regulators in the nucleus (Figure 22\u201312).

Plasma is prepared by removing the cells from blood without allowing clotting to occur; serum is prepared by allowing blood to clot and taking the cell-free liquid that remains. When blood clots, platelets incorporated in the clot are stimulated to release the contents of their secretory vesicles (Figure 17\u201360). The superior ability of serum to support cell proliferation suggested that platelets contain one or more mitogens. This hypothesis was confirmed by showing that extracts of platelets could serve instead of serum to stimulate fibroblast proliferation. The crucial factor in the extracts was shown to be a protein, which was subsequently purified and named PDGF. In the body, PDGF liberated"

            "content": "Nonresponsiveness to external growth-inhibiting signals: Cancer cells have lost responsiveness to signals normally present to stop proliferating when they have overgrown the niche normally occupied by the organ from which they are derived. We know very little about this mechanism of growth regulation. Increased angiogenesis: Due to increased gene expression of proangiogenic factors (VEGF, FGF, IL-8) by tumor or stromal cells, or loss of negative regulators (endostatin, tumstatin, thrombospondin). Invasion: Loss of cell-cell contacts (gap junctions, cadherins) and increased production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Often takes the form of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with anchored epithelial cells becoming more like motile fibroblasts. Metastasis: Spread of tumor cells to lymph nodes or distant tissue sites. Limited by the ability of tumor cells to survive in a foreign environment."

In addition, they modulate the intracellular ionic composition by regulating the activity of ion channels and transport proteins. Signaling molecules also control cytoskeleton-associated events, including cell shape, division, and migration and cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion.

            "content": "Whole-cell movements and the large-scale shaping and structuring of cells require the coordinated activities of all three basic filament systems along with a large variety of cytoskeletal accessory proteins, including motor proteins. Cell crawling\u2014a widespread behavior important in embryonic development and also in wound healing, tissue maintenance, and immune system function in the adult animal\u2014 is a prime example of such complex, coordinated cytoskeletal action. For a cell to crawl, it must generate and maintain an overall structural polarity, which is influenced by external cues. In addition, the cell must coordinate protrusion at the leading edge (by assembly of new actin filaments), adhesion of the newly protruded part of the cell to the substratum, and forces generated by molecular motors to bring the cell body forward. Which statements are true? Explain why or why not."
