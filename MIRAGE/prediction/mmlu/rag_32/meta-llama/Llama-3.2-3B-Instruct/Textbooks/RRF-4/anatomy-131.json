This suggests that the pituitary gland plays a key role in regulating the function of other endocrine glands. Additionally, Document [9] states that the pituitary gland is under significant control by the hypothalamus, and the hypothalamus regulates the release of hypothalamic-regulating hormones into the hypophyseal portal veins. This further emphasizes the importance of the pituitary gland in regulating the endocrine system. Therefore, based on the information provided, the pituitary gland is the most likely candidate for the master gland of the endocrine system. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Because they play central roles in a number of regulatory feedback systems, they are often called the \u201cmaster organs\u201d of the endocrine system. In the past, the control of pituitary hormone secretion by the hypothalamus was classically regarded as the major function of the neuroendocrine system. However, the field of neuroendocrinology today has expanded to encompass multiple reciprocal interactions between the central nervous system (CNS), autonomic nervous system (ANS), endocrine system, and immune system in the regulation of homeostasis and behavioral responses to environmental stimuli. For example, the neuroendocrine axes in maintaining energy homeostasis were discussed in Chapter 9 (Adipose Tissue)."

Its functions are essential in maintaining homeostasis and coordinating body growth and development and are similar to that of the nervous system: Both communicate information to peripheral cells and organs. Communication in the nervous system is through transmission of neural impulses along nerve cell processes and the discharge of neurotransmitter. Communication in the endocrine system is through hormones, which are carried to their destination via connective tissue spaces and the vascular system. These two systems are functionally interrelated. The endocrine system produces a slower and more prolonged response than the nervous system.

In addition to its traditional synaptic functions, the brain produces a vast array of peptide hormones, and this has led to the discipline of neuroendocrinology. Through the production of hypothalamic releasing factors, the central nervous system (CNS) exerts a major regulatory influence over pituitary hormone secretion (Chap. 401e). The peripheral nervous system stimulates the adrenal medulla. The immune and endocrine systems are also intimately intertwined. The adrenal hormone cortisol is a powerful immunosuppressant.

Paracrine regulation refers to factors released by one cell that act on an adjacent cell in the same tissue. For example, somatostatin secretion by pancreatic islet \u03b4 cells inhibits insulin secretion from nearby \u03b2 cells. Autocrine regulation describes the action of a factor on the same cell from which it is produced. IGF-I acts on many cells that produce it, including chondrocytes, breast epithelium, and gonadal cells.

Hypothalamic neurons release specific hypothalamic releasing hormones (designated XRH in this generic scheme) that stimulate secretion of specific pituitary tropic hormones (XTH). In some cases, production of a pituitary tropic hormone is secondarily regulated by a release-inhibiting hormone (XIH). Pituitary tropic hormones then act on specific peripheral target endocrine glands and stimulate them to release peripheral hormones (X).
