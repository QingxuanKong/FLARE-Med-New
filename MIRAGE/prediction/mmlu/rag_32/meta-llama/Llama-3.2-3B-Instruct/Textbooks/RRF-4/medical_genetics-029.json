    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break down the concept of autosomal recessive disorders and how they are inherited. Autosomal recessive disorders are caused by mutations in one of the two copies of a gene that an individual inherits from each parent. For an individual to be affected by an autosomal recessive disorder, they must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent). Since both parents are affected, they are likely to be homozygous for the mutated gene (having two copies of the mutated allele). When both parents are affected, the probability that each child will inherit two copies of the mutated gene (homozygous for the mutated allele) can be calculated as follows: - Each child has a 25% chance of inheriting the mutated allele from each parent (since each parent is likely to be homozygous for the mutated gene). - To inherit two copies of the mutated gene (homozygous), a child must inherit the mutated allele from both parents. - The probability of inheriting the mutated allele from both parents is the product of the probabilities of inheriting the mutated allele from each parent: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (or 6.25%). However, since we are interested in the probability of inheriting two normal alleles (homozygous for the normal allele) or two mutated alleles (homozygous for the mutated allele), we must consider the entire probability space. The sum of the probabilities of all possible genotypes is 1. - The probability of inheriting two normal alleles (homozygous for the normal allele) is 0.75 (1 - 0.0625). - Therefore, the probability of inheriting two mutated alleles (homozygous for the mutated allele) is 0.0625. Since we want to find the probability that each child will be affected (homozygous for the mutated allele), we add the probabilities of inheriting two mutated alleles and two normal alleles: 0.0625 + 0.0625 = 0.125. To convert this to a fraction, we simplify 0.125 to 1/8. However, the question asks for the probability that each of their children will be affected, which is the same as the probability of inheriting two mutated alleles. The fraction 1/8 does not directly answer the question. Since the question is multiple-choice, let's evaluate the options given. A. 1 in 4 is equivalent to 0.25, which is not the correct probability. B. 1 in 2 is equivalent to 0.5, which is also not the correct probability. C. 2 in 3 is equivalent to 0.6666..., which is not the correct probability. D. 1 is incorrect because it implies a 100% chance, which is not the case. However, reevaluating the question, we realize that we made an incorrect assumption about the genotype of the parents. If both parents are affected, they are likely to be heterozygous for the mutated gene (having one copy of the mutated allele and one copy of the normal allele). In this case, the probability that each child will be affected (homozygous for the mutated allele) is 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 1 in 16. However, this is still not among the options. Looking at the options, the closest answer is: A. 1 in 4, which is equivalent to 0.25, but we calculated the probability to be 1 in 16. However, if we re-evaluate the question, we realize that the probability of two parents being heterozygous for the mutated gene and each child inheriting the mutated allele is indeed 1 in 4, since the probability of each child inheriting the mutated allele from each parent is 0.5. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given that both parents are affected with the same autosomal recessive disorder, the probability that each of their children will be affected is 1 in 4, as each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated allele from each parent.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Males and females are affected with equal frequency because the defective gene resides on one of the 22 autosomes (Fig. 82-13A). Autosomal dominant mutations alter one of the two alleles at a given locus. Because the alleles segregate randomly at meiosis, the probability that an offspring will be affected is 50%. Unless there is a new germline mutation, an affected individual has an affected parent. Children with a normal genotype do not transmit the disorder.

As an example, mutations in the ibroblast growth actor receptor 3 (FGF3) gene may result in several diferent skeletal disorders, including achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia, both of which are discussed in Chapter 10 (p. 210). If only one copy of a gene pair determines the phenotype, that gene is considered to be dominant. Carriers have a 50-percent chance of passing on the afected gene with each conception. A gene with a dominant mutation generally speciies the phenotype in preference to the normal gene. That said, not all individuals will necessarily manifest an autosomal dominant condition the same way. Factors that afect the phenotype of an autosomal dominant condition include penetrance, expressivity, and occasionally, presence of codominant genes."

Regions of homozygosity have been used to help identify genes in which homozygous mutations result in disease phenotypes in families with known consanguinity."

Koller and Davenport made the observation that young patients usually inherit the disease from their fathers and older patients from their mothers. It has been observed beginning at almost the same age in identical twins."

In addition to 20% of congenital malformations, including cleft lip and palate and spina bifida, most common disordersof childhood and adult life, such as asthma, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and cancer, result from an interaction between genes andthe environment. These disorders do not follow simple mendelian modes of inheritance; rather, affected individuals tend to cluster in families. The disorders occur more often in firstand second-degree relatives than would be expected by chance, and they are more likely to be concordant (although not 100%) inmonozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins.

Although individually rare, together they account for approximately 1% of all adult admissions to hospitals and about 6% to 8% of all pediatric hospital admissions. Listed next are a few important tenets and caveats when considering mendelian disorders: Mutations involving single genes follow one of three patterns of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked."

            "content": "A heterozygous carrier of a recessive condition is only at risk to have afected children if his or her partner is heterozygous or homozygous for the disease. Genes for rare autosomal recessive conditions have low prevalence in the general population. Thus, the likelihood that a partner will be a gene carrier is small, unless there is consanguinity or the partner is a member of an at-risk group. Heterozygous carriers are usually undetectable clinically but may have biochemical test abnormalities that can be used for carrier screening. Other recessive conditions can be identified only by molecular genetic testing (Chap. 14, p. 288). Inborn Errors of Metabolism Most of these autosomal recessive diseases result from absence of a crucial enzyme, leading to incomplete metabolism of proteins, lipids, or carbohydrates. The metabolic intermediates that build up are toxic to various tissues and may result in intellectual disability or other abnormalities."
