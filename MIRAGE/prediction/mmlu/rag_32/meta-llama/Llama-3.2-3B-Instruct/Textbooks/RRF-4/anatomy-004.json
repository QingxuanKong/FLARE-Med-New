The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, and it consists of the renal corpuscle and a tubule system. The renal corpuscle contains a glomerulus, which is a cluster of blood capillaries. The glomerulus is supplied by an afferent arteriole and drained by an efferent arteriole. The efferent arteriole branches into peritubular capillaries that surround the tubules in the cortex. However, the question asks about the cluster of blood capillaries found in each nephron, which is the glomerulus. The glomerulus is a critical component of the nephron and is responsible for filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood.

The nephron is the basic functional unit of the kidney and is described in a following section. The renal corpuscles are spherical structures, barely visible with the naked eye.

The majority of nephrons are cortical, with glomeruli located in the mid-to-outer cortex. Fewer nephrons are juxtamedullary, with glomeruli at the boundary of the cortex and outer medulla. Cortical nephrons have short loops of Henle, whereas juxtamedullary nephrons have long loops of Henle. There are critical differences in blood supply as well.

Bowman\u2019s capsule is the initial portion of the nephron, where blood flowing through the glomerular capillaries undergoes filtration to produce the glomerular ultrafiltrate. The glomerular capillaries are supplied by an afferent arteriole and are drained by an efferent arteriole that then branches, forming a new capillary network to supply the kidney tubules. The site where the afferent and efferent arterioles penetrate and exit from the parietal layer of Bowman\u2019s capsule is called the vascular pole.

A growing number of genes have been identified at various stages of glomerulotubular development in the mammalian kidney. The genes listed have been tested in various genetically modified mice, and their location corresponds to the classical stages of kidney development postulated by Saxen in 1987. called vasa recta. Cortical nephrons perform most of the glomerular filtration because there are more of them and because their afferent arterioles are larger than their respective efferent arterioles. The juxtamedullary nephrons, with longer loops of Henle, create an osmotic gradient for concentrating urine. How developmental instructions specify the differentiation of all these unique epithelia among various tubular segments is still unknown."

Bowman\u2019s capsule (BC) is shown on the left; it is continuous at the dashed line (marked by arrowheads) with the tubule cells of the proximal tubule (PTC). Note the numerous mitochondria (M) in the base of these cells and the brush border (BB) at the apex, projecting into the urinary space. The nuclei of three adjacent mesangial cells (MC) can be seen in the upper right of the micrograph. 4,700."

The renal artery gives rise to interlobar arteries that branch into arcuate arteries at the border between the medulla and cortex. Interlobular arteries (IL) branch from the arcuate arteries and travel toward the renal capsule, giving off afferent arterioles to the glomeruli (G). Glomeruli in the outer part of the cortex (G1, G2) send efferent arterioles to the peritubular capillaries (PC) that surround the tubules in the cortex; glomeruli near the medulla (G3), the juxtamedullary glomeruli, send efferent arterioles almost entirely into the medullary plexus (MP) of capillaries via the arteriolae rectae spuriae (ARS). Blood returns from the capillaries via veins that enter the arcuate veins. Stellate veins (SV) near the capsule drain both the capsular (CC) and the peritubular capillaries."

The transcription of these genes is guided by morphogenic cues that invite two ureteric buds to each penetrate bilateral metanephric blastema, where they induce primary mesenchymal cells to form early nephrons. The two ureteric buds emerge from posterior nephric ducts and mature into separate collecting systems that eventually form a renal pelvis and ureter. Induced mesenchyme undergoes mesenchymal epithelial transitions to form comma-shaped bodies at the proximal end of each ureteric bud leading to the formation of S-shaped nephrons that cleft and enjoin with penetrating endothelial cells derived from sprouting angioblasts. Under the influence of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), these penetrating cells form capillaries with surrounding mesangial cells that differentiate into a glomerular filter for plasma water and solute.
