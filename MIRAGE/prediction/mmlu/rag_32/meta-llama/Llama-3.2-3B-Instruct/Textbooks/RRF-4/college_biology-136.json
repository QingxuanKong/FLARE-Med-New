The female fruit fly has gray body and normal wings, while the male has black body and vestigial wings. We are asked to determine why the presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies appears among the progeny. First, let's analyze the possible genotypes of the parents: - The female has gray body and normal wings, which suggests that she is heterozygous for a gene that controls body color (e.g., 'G' for gray and 'g' for black) and has a normal allele for wing development (e.g., 'W' for normal wings and 'w' for vestigial wings). Her genotype could be Gg or Gg. - The male has black body and vestigial wings, suggesting he is homozygous recessive for the body color gene (gg) and homozygous recessive for the wing development gene (ww). Now, let's consider the possible genotypes of the offspring: - If the female is GG or Gg, she can contribute either a G or g allele to each offspring. Since the male is gg, he can only contribute a g allele. Therefore, the possible genotypes of the offspring are Gg and gg. - The Gg genotype will express the gray body trait, and the gg genotype will express the black body trait. However, the wing development gene is recessive, so the Gg genotype will express normal wings, while the gg genotype will express vestigial wings. Now, let's analyze the options: - A. Crossing over: This process involves the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. It can result in the creation of new combinations of alleles, but it doesn't directly explain the presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies. - B. Independent assortment: This process involves the random separation of chromosomes during meiosis, which can result in the creation of new combinations of alleles. However, it doesn't directly explain the presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies. - C. Segregation of alleles: This process involves the separation of alleles during meiosis, which can result in the creation of offspring with different combinations of alleles. In this case, the segregation of the body color and wing development genes can result in offspring with gray bodies and normal wings (Gg) and black bodies and vestigial wings (gg). - D. Penetrance: This term refers to the expression of a trait in an individual based on their genotype. While penetrance can affect the expression of traits, it doesn't explain the presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny. Based on the analysis, the presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny is best explained by the segregation of alleles, specifically the segregation of the body color and wing development genes. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ``` The final answer is C.",

Although it may seem counterintuitive, one of the most direct ways to find out what a gene does is to see what happens to the organism when that gene is missing. Studying mutant organisms that have acquired changes or deletions in their nucleotide sequences is a time-honored practice in biology and forms the basis of the important field of genetics. Because mutations can disrupt cell processes, mutants often hold the key to understanding gene function. In the classical genetic approach, one begins by isolating mutants that have an interesting or unusual appearance: fruit flies with white eyes or curly wings, for example. Working backward from the phenotype\u2014the appearance or behavior of the individual\u2014one then determines the organism\u2019s genotype, the form of the gene responsible for that characteristic (Panel 8\u20132)."

In the Antennapedia mutant, for example, legs sprout from the head in place of antennae, whereas in the Bithorax mutant, portions of an extra pair of wings appear where normally there should be the much smaller appendages called halteres (Figure 21\u201323). These mutations transform parts of the body into structures appropriate to other positions, and they are called homeotic mutations (from the Greek \u201chomoios,\u201d meaning similar) because the transformation is between structures of a recognizably similar general type, changing one kind of limb, or one kind of segment, into another.

The egg-polarity genes act first in a hierarchy of gene systems that define a progressively more detailed pattern of body parts.

The work on Neurospora showed that most genes correspond to a region of the genome that directs the synthesis of a single enzyme. This led to the hypothesis that one gene encodes one polypeptide chain. The hypothesis proved fruitful for subsequent research; as more was learned about the mechanism of gene expression in the 1960s, a gene became identified as that stretch of DNA that was transcribed into the RNA coding for a single polypeptide chain (or a single structural RNA such as a tRNA or an rRNA molecule). The discovery of split genes and introns in the late 1970s could be readily accommodated by the original definition of a gene, provided that a single polypeptide chain was specified by the RNA transcribed from any one DNA sequence."

            "content": "At first glance, one would no more expect the worm, the flea, the eagle, and the giant squid all to be generated by the same developmental mechanisms than one would suppose that the same methods were used to make a shoe and an airplane. Remarkably, however, research in the past 30 years has revealed that much of the basic machinery of development is essentially the same in all animals\u2014not just in all vertebrates, but in all the major phyla of invertebrates too. Recognizably similar, evolutionarily related molecules define the specialized animal cell types, mark the differences between body regions, and help create the animal body pattern. Homologous proteins are often functionally interchangeable between very different species. Thus, a human protein produced artificially in a fly, for example, can perform the same function as the fly\u2019s own version of that protein (Figure 21\u20132). Thanks to an underlying unity of mechanisms, developmental biologists have been making great strides toward"

            "content": "15\u201317 The Wnt planar polarity signaling pathway normally ensures that each wing cell in Drosophila has a single hair. Overexpression of the Frizzled gene from a heat-shock promoter (hs-Fz) causes multiple hairs to grow from many cells (Figure Q15\u20135A). This phenotype is suppressed if hs-Fz is combined with a heterozygous deletion (Dsh\u0394) of the Dishevelled gene (Figure Q15\u20135B). Do these results allow you to order the action of Frizzled and Dishevelled in the signaling pathway? If so, what is the order? Explain your reasoning.

            "content": "One example is the development of sensory bristles in Drosophila, most easily seen on the fly\u2019s back, but also present on most of its other exposed surfaces. Each of these is a miniature sense organ, consisting of a sensory neuron and a small set of supporting cells. Some bristles respond to chemical stimuli, others to mechanical stimuli, but they are all constructed in a similar way (Figure 21\u201334). The pro-neural genes Achaete and Scute mentioned earlier mark the patches of epidermis within which bristles will form. Mutations that eliminate the expression of these genes at some of their usual sites block development of bristles at just those sites, and mutations that cause expression in abnormal sites cause bristles to develop there."

These are epithelial pouches that grow by cell proliferation during the larval period and, during the pupal stage, form the organs and extremities of the adult fly (Figure 21\u201360). Experiments have been chiefly done on the wing imaginal disc. Mutations in components of the cell-cycle control machinery can be used to speed up or slow down the rate of cell division in the disc. Remarkably, such mutations can result in an excessive number of abnormally small cells Figure 21\u201360 The imaginal discs in the Drosophila larva (below) and the structures in the adult (above) that they give rise to.

The phenotype of the offspring gives the answer to the question. NONCOMPLEMENTATION: TWO INDEPENDENT MUTATIONS IN THE SAME GENE hybrid offspring shows normal phenotype: hybrid offspring shows mutant phenotype: one normal copy of each gene is present no normal copies of the mutated gene are present large populations\u2014thousands or tens of thousands of individual organisms\u2014isolating mutant individuals is much more efficient if one generates mutations with chemicals or radiation that damage DNA. By treating organisms with such mutagens, very large numbers of mutant individuals can be created quickly and then screened for a particular defect of interest, as we discuss shortly."

Some types of cells, in many organisms, grow abnormally large through multiple cycles of DNA synthesis without cell division. Such cells, containing increased numbers of standard chromosomes, are said to be polyploid. In the salivary glands of fly larvae, this process is taken to an extreme degree, creating huge cells that contain hundreds or thousands of copies of the Figure 4\u201347 lampbrush chromosomes."
