Most importantly, there are Ca2+-pumps in the plasma membrane and the ER membrane that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to pump Ca2+ out of the cytosol. Cells such as muscle and nerve cells, which make extensive use of Ca2+ signaling, have an additional Ca2+ transporter (a Na+-driven Ca2+ exchanger) in their plasma membrane that couples the efflux of Ca2+ to the influx of Na+. The IP3 receptors and ryanodine receptors of the ER membrane have an important feature: they are both stimulated by low to moderate cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations. This Ca2+-induced calcium release (CICR) results in positive feedback,"

Each cyclase molecule, in turn, can catalyze the conversion of a large number of ATP molecules to cAMP molecules. A similar amplification operates in the IP3 signaling pathway. In these ways, a nanomolar (10\u20139 M) change in the concentration of an extracellular signal can induce micromolar (10\u20136 M) changes in the concentration of a second messenger such as cAMP or Ca2+. Because these messengers function as allosteric effectors to activate specific enzymes or ion channels, a single extracellular signal molecule can alter many thousands of protein molecules within the target cell."

When a small amount of cytosolic IP3 activates a cluster of IP3 receptors at one site on the ER membrane (top), the local release of Ca2+ promotes the opening of nearby IP3 and ryanodine receptors, resulting in more Ca2+ release. This positive feedback (indicated by positive signs) produces a regenerative wave of Ca2+ release that spreads across the cell (see Figure 15\u201330). These waves of Ca2+ release move more quickly across the cell than would be possible by simple diffusion.

As emphasized earlier, the response to stimulation can be rapid only if the inactivating mechanisms are also rapid. Cells therefore have efficient mechanisms for rapidly degrading (and resynthesizing) cyclic nucleotides and for buffering and removing cytosolic Ca2+, as well as for inactivating the responding enzymes and ion channels once they have been activated. This is not only essential for turning a response off, but is also important for defining the resting state from which a response begins.

InsP3 is generated by a stimulus that acts on sarcolemmal receptors that are coupled via a guanine nucleotide\u2013binding protein (G protein) to activate phospholipase C (PLC) (see ). PLC hydrolyzes the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) into InsP3 and diacylglycerol.

In muscle cells, Ca2+ triggers contraction, and in many secretory cells, including nerve cells, it triggers secretion. Ca2+ has numerous other functions in a variety of cell types. Ca2+ is such an effective signaling mediator because its concentration in the cytosol is normally very low (~10\u20137 M), whereas its concentration in the extracellular fluid (~10\u20133 M) and in the lumen of the ER [and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in muscle] is high.

The amount of Ca2 entering the cell after activation of the voltage-sensor protein is usually insufficient to initiate smooth muscle contraction and needs to be supplemented by release of Ca2 from the sER.

            "content": "Fig. 7.7 Signaling pathways amplify the initial signal. amplification of the initial signal is an important element of most signal transduction pathways. one means of amplification is a kinase cascade (left panel), in which protein kinases successively phosphorylate and activate each other. in this example, taken from a commonly used kinase cascade (see fig. 7.19), activation of the kinase Raf results in the phosphorylation and activation of a second kinase, mek, that phosphorylates yet another kinase, erk. as each kinase can phosphorylate many different substrate molecules, the signal is amplified at each step, resulting in a huge amplification of the initial signal. another method of signal amplification is the generation of second messengers (center and right panels). in this example, signaling results in the release of the second messenger calcium (ca2+) from intracellular stores into the cytosol or its influx from the extracellular environment. ca2+ release from the endoplasmic"

            "content": "Another important property of IP3 receptors and ryanodine receptors is that they are inhibited, after some delay, by high Ca2+ concentrations (a form of negative feedback). Thus, the rise in Ca2+ in a stimulated cell leads to inhibition of Ca2+ release; because Ca2+ pumps remove the cytosolic Ca2+, the Ca2+ concentration falls (see Figure 15\u201331). The decline in Ca2+ eventually relieves the negative feedback, allowing cytosolic Ca2+ to rise again. As in other cases of delayed negative feedback (see Figure 15\u201318), the result is an oscillation in the Ca2+ concentration. These oscillations persist for as long as receptors are activated at the cell surface, and their frequency reflects the strength of the extracellular stimulus (Figure 15\u201332). The frequency, amplitude, and breadth of oscillations can also be modulated by other signaling mechanisms, such as phosphorylation, which influence the Ca2+ sensitivity of Ca2+ channels or affect other components in the signaling system."

            "content": "Figure 15\u20137 Two types of intracellular signaling proteins that act as molecular switches. (A) A protein kinase covalently adds a phosphate from ATP to the signaling protein, and a protein phosphatase removes the phosphate. Although not shown, many signaling proteins are activated by dephosphorylation rather than by phosphorylation. (B) A GTP-binding protein is induced to exchange its bound GDP for GTP, which activates the protein; the protein then inactivates itself by hydrolyzing its bound GTP to GDP. signaling molecules share the cytoplasm with a crowd of closely related signaling molecules that control a diverse array of cellular processes. It is inevitable that an occasional signaling molecule will bind or modify the wrong partner, potentially creating unwanted cross-talk and interference between signaling systems. How does a signal remain strong, precise, and specific under these noisy conditions?"

            "content": "The succeeding sections will amplify specific points of this summary. However, it is worth mentioning at this point that some of the nonclassic types of neurotransmitters (e.g., neuropeptides and gaseous neurotransmitters such as nitric oxide) and the discovery of metabotropic receptors have required modifications of several aspects of this basic conception. (Whereas an ionotropic receptor usually contains the ion channel as an integral part of itself, a metabotropic receptor does not contain an ion channel but instead is coupled to a G protein that initiates second messenger cascades that can ultimately affect ion channels.) Some of the differences between classic and peptide transmitters are listed in Table 6.1 . More details on the properties of peptide and gaseous transmitters are provided in the relevant parts of the section of this chapter, and metabotropic receptors are covered in the Receptors section.
