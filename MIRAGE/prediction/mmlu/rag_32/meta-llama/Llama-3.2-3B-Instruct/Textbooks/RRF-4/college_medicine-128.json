The energy stored in these high-energy phosphate bonds comes from the metabolism of fatty acids and glucose. Glucose is the primary metabolic sub-strate in actively contracting muscle. It is derived from the general circulation as well as from the breakdown of glyco-gen, which is normally stored in the muscle fiber cyto-plasm. As much as 1% of the dry weight of skeletal and cardiac muscle may be glycogen. In rapidly contracting muscles, such as the leg muscles in running or the extraocular muscles, most of the energy for contraction is supplied by anaerobic glycolysis of stored glycogen. The buildup of intermediary metabolites from this pathway, particularly lactic acid, can produce an oxygen deficit that causes ischemic pain (cramps) in cases of extreme muscular exertion.

In striated muscle, glycogen is an important source of energy. Not surprisingly, most forms of glycogen storage disease affect muscles. When enzymes that are involved in glycolysis are deficient, glycogen storage occurs in muscles and there is an associated muscle weakness due to impaired energy production. Typically, the myopathic forms of glycogen storage diseases are marked by muscle cramps after exercise, myoglobinuria, and failure of exercise to induce an elevation in blood lactate levels because of a block in glycolysis.

As stated earlier, the circumstances during exercise are somewhat different. During a short period of intense exercise, the muscle uses carbohydrate derived from glycogen stores; myophosphorylase is the enzyme that initiates the metabolism of glycogen. With longer aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen stores, energy is provided by oxidation of fatty acids. Thus, muscle failure at a certain phase of exercise is predictive of the type of energy failure. A rising blood concentration of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate reflects the increasing oxidation of fatty acids, and an increase in blood lactate reflects the anaerobic metabolism of glucose.

During a prolonged fast, however, hepatic glycogen stores are depleted, and glucose is made from noncarbohydrate precursors. The formation of glucose does not occur by a simple reversal of glycolysis, because the overall equilibrium of glycolysis strongly favors pyruvate formation (that is, the change in standard free energy [\u2206G0] is negative). Instead, glucose is synthesized de novo by a special pathway, gluconeogenesis, which requires both mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes.

            "content": "Insulin-sensitive tissues (muscle, liver, and fat) fail to metabolize glucose efficiently in the absence of insulin. In uncontrolled type 1 diabetes, an excess of counter-regulatory hormones (cortisol, catecholamines, and glucagon) contributes to further metabolic dysfunction. In the absence of adequate amounts of insulin, increasing breakdown products of muscle (amino acid proteolysis), fat (fatty acid lipolysis), and glycogen (glucose glycogenolysis) are recognized. There is an increase in glucose production from noncarbohydrate precursors as a result of gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis in the liver. Without prompt treatment, severe metabolic decompensation (i.e., diabetic ketoacidosis) will occur and may lead to death."

The infantile form is the most common, with onset of symptoms in the first 3 months of life. Infants develop severe muscle weakness, cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly, and respiratory insufficiency. Glycogen accumulation in motor neurons of the spinal cord and brainstem contributes to muscle weakness. Death usually occurs by 1 year of age. In the childhood form, the picture resembles muscular dystrophy. Delayed motor milestones result from proximal limb muscle weakness and involvement of respiratory muscles. The heart may be involved, but the liver and brain are unaffected. The adult form usually begins in the third or fourth decade but can present as late as the seventh decade.

Glycogenolysis activation by AMP: Muscle glycogen phosphorylase (myophosphorylase), but not the liver isozyme, is active in the presence of the high AMP concentrations that occur under extreme conditions of anoxia and ATP depletion. AMP binds to glycogen phosphorylase b, causing its activation without phosphorylation (see Fig. 11.9). [Note: Recall that AMP also activates phosphofructokinase-1 of glycolysis (see p. 99), allowing glucose from glycogenolysis to be oxidized.] 3. Glycogenolysis activation by calcium: Calcium (Ca2+) is released into the sarcoplasm in muscle cells (myocytes) in response to neural stimulation and in the liver in response to epinephrine binding to \u03b11 adrenergic receptors. The Ca2+ binds to calmodulin (CaM), the most widely distributed member of a family of small, Ca2+-binding proteins. The binding of four molecules of Ca2+ to CaM triggers a conformational change such that the activated Ca2+\u2013CaM complex binds to and activates protein molecules, often"

The onset of gluconeogenesis during fasting is slower than glycogenolysis, but gluconeogenesis continues essentially nonstop throughout a fasting phase ( Fig. 39.4 ). Gluconeogenesis requires precursors, especially lactate, \u201cgluconeogenic\u201d AAs, and glycerol. How are these precursors supplied during the fasting phase? Lactate is continually produced by erythrocytes. Lactate is also produced by glycolytic skeletal muscle fibers during exercise (exercise tends to occur more frequently during the interdigestive and fasting phases as opposed to \u201con a full stomach\u201d), although much of this lactate is utilized by aerobic skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle during exercise. But additionally the overall anabolism of the digestive phase switches over to a general catabolism during the fasting phase (see Fig."
