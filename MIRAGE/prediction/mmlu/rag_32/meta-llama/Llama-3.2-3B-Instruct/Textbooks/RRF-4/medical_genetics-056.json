Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, resulting in the production of gametes. It consists of two successive cell divisions: meiosis I and meiosis II. Recombination occurs as part of the process of meiosis I. Meiosis I is characterized by prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, and telophase I. Recombination begins with a programmed double-strand break, which is followed by the formation of a Holliday junction and subsequent crossing-over. This process occurs in prophase I, making option B the correct answer. Metaphase I is where the homologous chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate, but recombination has already occurred before this stage. Metaphase II is the first division of meiosis II, where sister chromatids are separated, but recombination has already taken place in meiosis I. Prophase II is the second division of meiosis II, where the chromosomes condense and prepare for separation, but recombination has already occurred in meiosis I. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

Homologous recombination is also responsible for the crossing-over of chromosomes that occurs during meiosis. Homologous recombination takes place through a variety of pathways, but they have in common a strand-exchange step whereby a single strand from one DNA duplex invades a second duplex and base-pairs with one strand while displacing the other. This reaction, catalyzed by the RecA/Rad51 family of proteins, can only occur if the invading strand can form a short stretch of consecutive nucleotide pairs with one of the strands of the duplex.

For these organisms with short generation times and relatively small genomes, it was possible to isolate a large set of mutants with defects in their recombination processes.

            "content": "Crossing-over has two distinct functions in meiosis: it helps hold homologs together so that they are properly segregated to the two daughter nuclei produced by meiosis I, and it contributes to the genetic diversification of the gametes that are eventually produced. As might be expected, therefore, crossing-over is highly regulated: the number and location of double-strand breaks along each chromosome is controlled, as is the likelihood that a break will be converted into a crossover. On average, the result of this regulation is that each pair of human homologs is linked by about two or three crossovers (Figure 17\u201359). Although the double-strand breaks that occur in meiosis I can be located almost anywhere along the chromosome, they are not distributed uniformly: they cluster at \u201chot spots,\u201d where the DNA is accessible, and occur only rarely in \u201ccold spots,\u201d such as the heterochromatin regions around centromeres and telomeres."

            "content": "Meiosis I results in reduction of both the number of chromosomes (from 2n to 1n) and the amount of DNA to the haploid condition (from 4d to 2d); thus, secondary spermatocyte is characterized by haploid number of chromosomes (1n) and 2d amount of DNA. Because no DNA replication precedes meiosis II, after this division each spermatid has the haploid (1n) number of chromosomes, each containing a single chromatid (1d). Meiosis is described in detail in Chapter 3 (see page 89); a brief description of spermatocyte meiosis follows. Prophase of the first meiotic division, during which the chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, lasts up to 22 days in human primary spermatocytes. At the end of prophase, 44 autosomes and an X and a Y chromosome, each having two chromatin strands (chromatids), can be identified. Homologous chromosomes are paired as they line up on the metaphase plate."
