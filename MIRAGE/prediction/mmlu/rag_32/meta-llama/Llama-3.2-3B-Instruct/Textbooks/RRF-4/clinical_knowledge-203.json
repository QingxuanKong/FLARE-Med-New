The Gore Propaten graft has heparin bonded onto the luminal surface of the PTFE graft using Carmeda BioActive Surface (CBAS) technology, which immobilizes the heparin molecule with a single covalent bond that does not alter its anti-coagulant properties.196 The heparin binding does not alter the microstructure and handling characteristics of the PTFE. A pro-spective, randomized trial by Devine and colleagues suggested that heparin-bonded Dacron or PTFE was superior to plain PTFE for above-knee popliteal bypasses. The 3-year primary patency rate for the heparin-bonded grafts was 55% compared with 42% for PTFE (P <0.044). Both of these patency rates are inferior to great saphenous vein grafts; however, if the improved results with heparin bonding continue to be"

The clinical and bacteriologic profile of infective endocarditis in patients with CHD has changed with the advent of intracardiac surgery and of prosthetic devices. Prophylaxis includes both antimicrobial and hygienic measures. Meticulous dental and skin care are required. Routine antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended for bacteremic dental procedures or instrumentation through an infected site in most patients with operated CHD, particularly if foreign material, such as a prosthetic valve, conduit, or surgically constructed shunt, is in place. In the case of patches, in the absence of a high-pressure patch leak, or transcatheter devices, prophylaxis is usually recommended for 6 months until there is endothelialization. Individuals with unrepaired cyanotic heart disease are also generally recommended to receive prophylaxis (Chap."

If cultures may be negative because of confounding by prior antibiotic administration, broader empirical therapy may be indicated, with particular attention to pathogens that are likely to be inhibited by the specific prior therapy."

As a minor component of bone, constituting only 10% of the total weight of bone matrix proteins, they are essential to bone development, growth, remodeling, and repair. Both the collagen and the ground substance become mineralized to form bone tissue. The four main groups of noncollagenous proteins found in the bone matrix are the following: \u0081 Proteoglycan macromolecules contain a core protein with various numbers of covalently attached side chains of glycosaminoglycans (hyaluronan, chondroitin sulfate, and keratan sulfate). They contribute to the compressive strength of bone. They are also responsible for binding growth factors and may inhibit mineralization. Proteoglycans are described in detail in Chapter 6 (Table 6.3, page 176)."
