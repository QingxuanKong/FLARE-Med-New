    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's analyze each option step by step. First, let's define each term: A. Osmosis: the movement of water molecules across a semipermeable membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, due to the difference in solute concentrations. B. Passive Transport: the movement of molecules across a cell membrane without the need for energy input. This can be either facilitated diffusion (down a concentration gradient) or osmosis. C. Active Transport: the movement of molecules across a cell membrane using energy, typically in the form of ATP. This can be either secondary active transport (using the energy from a concentration gradient) or primary active transport (using direct energy input). D. Endocytosis: the process by which a cell engulfs and internalizes molecules or particles from outside the cell, using a portion of the cell membrane to form a vesicle. Now, let's analyze each option: A. Osmosis: This is a type of passive transport, but it specifically refers to the movement of water molecules, not other substances. So, this is not the correct answer. B. Passive Transport: This option includes both facilitated diffusion and osmosis, both of which use the gradient of a substance to control the direction of movement. This is the correct answer. C. Active Transport: This requires energy input, so it does not fit the description in the question. D. Endocytosis: This is a type of active transport, as it requires energy to form and fuse vesicles with the cell membrane. So, the correct answer is B. Passive Transport, as it is the process that uses the gradient of a substance to control the direction of movement, without the need for energy input.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",

As K+ begins to move out, each ion leaves behind an unbalanced negative charge, thereby creating an electrical field, or membrane potential, which will tend to oppose the further efflux of K+. The net efflux of K+ halts when the membrane potential reaches a value at which this electrical driving force on K+ exactly balances the effect of its concentration gradient\u2014that is, when the electrochemical gradient for K+ is zero.

Because the translation of RNA into protein is fundamental to all living cells, this component of the ribosome has been very well conserved since early in the history of life on Earth (Figure 1\u201318). Natural selection has generally favored those prokaryotic cells that can reproduce the fastest by taking up raw materials from their environment and replicating themselves most efficiently, at the maximal rate permitted by the available food supplies.

This balancing role is performed largely by K+, which is actively pumped into the cell by the Na+K+ pump and can also move freely in or out through the K+ leak channels in the plasma membrane. Because of the presence of these channels, K+ comes almost to equilibrium, where an electrical force exerted by an excess of negative charges attracting K+ into the cell balances the tendency of K+ to leak out down its concentration gradient. The membrane potential (of the plasma membrane) is the manifestation of this electrical force, and we can calculate its equilibrium value from the steepness of the K+ concentration gradient. The following argument may help to make this clear."

It then uses this energy to generate order within itself. In the course of the chemical reactions that generate order, the cell converts part of the energy it uses into heat.

            "content": "Every cell must eat, communicate with the world around it, and quickly respond to changes in its environment. To help accomplish these tasks, cells continually adjust the composition of their plasma membrane and internal compartments in rapid response to need. They use an elaborate internal membrane system to add and remove cell-surface proteins, such as receptors, ion channels, and transporters (Figure 13\u20131). Through the process of exocytosis, the secretory pathway delivers newly synthesized proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids either to the plasma membrane or the extracellular space. By the converse process of endocytosis, cells remove plasma membrane components and deliver them to internal compartments called endosomes, from where they can be recycled to the same or different regions of the plasma membrane or be delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Cells also use endocytosis to capture important nutrients, such as vitamins, cholesterol, and iron; these are taken up together with"
