    "question": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of numbness in her right hand. During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with numbness and tingling in the right hand, specifically in the ring and small fingers. The patient is a former softball pitcher, which suggests a possible connection to repetitive motion. The palpation of the right elbow produces a severe pain in the right ring and small fingers, indicating that the pain is likely related to the elbow region. The decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger suggests a compression or entrapment of a nerve that provides sensation to these areas. The most likely nerves to consider are the ulnar nerve and the median nerve. The ulnar nerve is more likely to cause symptoms in the little finger, while the median nerve is more likely to cause symptoms in the thumb, index, and middle fingers. Given the symptoms in the ring and small fingers, the ulnar nerve is a more likely candidate. The patient's occupation as a cashier and use of a computer may also contribute to repetitive motion and increased pressure on the elbow, which could exacerbate the condition. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's findings is entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Placing the fist in a palm-down position on the table and pressing the middle phalanges onto the table effectively immobilizes the action of the extensor digitorum. The freshman was therefore unable to elevate his middle finger (which was sticking out). It is important to remember that if this same procedure is carried out leaving the index or little finger free to move, they do. This is because these two digits are extended not only by the extensor digitorum muscle but also by the extensor indicis muscle (index finger) and extensor digiti minimi muscle (little finger). A 70-year-old woman came to an orthopedic surgeon with right shoulder pain and failure to initiate abduction of the shoulder. Further examination revealed loss of muscle bulk in the supraspinous fossa. The supraspinatus muscle was damaged."

The pain is momentary but leaves in its wake a patch of circumscribed numbness. Cutaneous sensory nerves must be involved in some way and are irritated during such mechanical maneuvers. The areas involved are usually proximal to the most terminal sensory distribution of nerves encompassing, for example, a patch on the lateral side of the hand and the proximal fifth finger or a larger region over the patella (these were the sites affected in 3 of our patients). Recovery of the area of numbness takes several weeks, but it may persist if the symptoms are induced repeatedly. Except for these patches of cutaneous analgesia, the clinical examination is normal.

It is easier for a patient to perceive the boundary of an abnormal area of sensation if the examiner proceeds from an area of reduced sensation toward the normal area. One should not press the sensory examination in the presence of fatigue, for an inattentive patient is a poor witness. Also, the examiner must avoid suggesting symptoms to the patient. After explaining in the simplest terms what is required, the examiner interposes as few questions and remarks as possible. Patients should generally not be asked, \u201cDo you feel that?\u201d each time they are touched; they are simply told to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201csharp\u201d every time they are touched or feel pain.

            "content": "Examination discloses varying degrees of motor, sensory, and reflex loss. As the symptoms suggest, the signs are symmetrical, and more severe in distal than in proximal portions of the limbs, and often confined to the legs. In some cases, the disproportionate affection of motor power may be striking, taking the form of a footand wrist-drop, but the proximal muscles are usually affected as well (indicated, for example, by climbing stairs or by difficulty in arising from a squatting position). In a few patients, the weakness appears to be most severe in the proximal muscles. Absolute paralysis of the legs had been observed in the past only rarely; immobility caused by contractures at the knees and ankles in neglected patients was a more common occurrence. Tenderness of muscles on deep pressure is a highly characteristic finding, elicited most readily in the muscles of the feet and calves. In the arms, tendon reflexes are sometimes retained despite a loss of strength in the hands. In"

The patient\u2019s hand was placed over her right buttock, a position that acts to externally rotate and extend the shoulder, exposing the supraspinatus tendon for ultrasound scan examination. The ultrasound revealed a completely torn tendon with fluid in the subacromial subdeltoid bursa (eFig. 7.128). The patient underwent a surgical repair and made a good recovery. A 35-year-old baseball pitcher came to the clinic with a history of a recurrent dislocation of the shoulder (eFig. 7.129). An MRI scan was performed to assess the shoulder joint prior to any treatment. The MRI demonstrates the anatomical structures in multiple planes, allowing the physician to obtain an overview of the shoulder and to assess any intraarticular or extraarticular structures that may have been damaged and require surgical repair."

            "content": "A primarily neurologic problem may characterize the thoracic outlet syndrome. There is slight wasting and weakness of the hypothenar, interosseous, adductor pollicis, and deep flexor muscles of the fourth and fifth fingers (i.e., the muscles innervated by the lower trunk of the brachial plexus and ulnar nerve). Weakness of the flexor muscles of the forearm may be present in advanced cases. Tendon reflexes are usually preserved. In addition, most patients complain of an intermittent aching of the arm, particularly of the ulnar side, and about half of them complain also of numbness and tingling along the ulnar border of the forearm and hand. A loss of superficial sensation in these areas is variable. It may be possible to reproduce the sensory symptoms by firm pressure just above the clavicle or by traction on the arm. Vascular features are often absent or minimal in patients with the neurologic form of the syndrome."

Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months.

Usually numbness and mild sensitivity of the skin are the only symptoms, but occasionally there is a persistent distressing burning pain. Perception of touch and pinprick are reduced in the territory of the nerve; there is no weakness of the quadriceps or diminution of the knee jerk. The symptoms are characteristically worsened in certain positions and after prolonged standing or walking. Occasionally, for an obese person, sitting is the most uncomfortable position. Obesity, pregnancy, and diabetes mellitus may be contributory factors. Most often the neuropathy is unilateral, but Ecker and Woltman found 20 percent of their patients to have bilateral symptoms."
