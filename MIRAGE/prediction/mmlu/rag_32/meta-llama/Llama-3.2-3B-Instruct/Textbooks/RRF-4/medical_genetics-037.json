Homeotic mutations refer to genetic alterations that cause a change in the identity of a body part during development. This typically involves a transformation of one body part into another part of a different type, often in a similar or homologous region. Let's examine each option in light of this definition:\\n\\nA. is present in only one form in an individual - This option does not directly describe the effects of a homeotic mutation, which involves a transformation of one body part into another, not a restriction to a single form.\\n\\nB. substitutes one body part for another in development - This option aligns with the definition of homeotic mutations, which involve a transformation of one body part into another during development.\\n\\nC. results in development of a tumor - While homeotic mutations can have significant effects on development, the development of a tumor is not a characteristic specifically associated with homeotic mutations. Tumors are typically the result of other types of genetic alterations.\\n\\nD. is wild type at one temperature and abnormal at another - This option describes a phenomenon related to temperature-sensitive mutations, not homeotic mutations.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is the option that accurately describes the effect of a homeotic mutation on development.\\n\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

In the Antennapedia mutant, for example, legs sprout from the head in place of antennae, whereas in the Bithorax mutant, portions of an extra pair of wings appear where normally there should be the much smaller appendages called halteres (Figure 21\u201323). These mutations transform parts of the body into structures appropriate to other positions, and they are called homeotic mutations (from the Greek \u201chomoios,\u201d meaning similar) because the transformation is between structures of a recognizably similar general type, changing one kind of limb, or one kind of segment, into another. It was eventually discovered that a whole set of genes, the homeotic selector genes, or Hox genes, serve to permanently specify the A-P characters of the whole set of animal segments.

A recessive mutation is one that is no longer able to cause the mutant phenotype in the presence of a single wild-type copy of the gene. Although cases have been described in which a loss-of-function mutation is dominant or a gain-of-function mutation is recessive, in the vast majority of cases, recessive mutations are loss of function and dominant mutations are gain Figure 8\u201346 Screening for temperature-sensitive bacterial or yeast mutants."

If the mutation has a significantly deleterious effect, it will simply be eliminated by purifying selection and will not become fixed. (In the most extreme case, the individual carrying the mutation will die without producing progeny.) Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population. Because humans reproduce sexually and genetic recombination occurs each time a gamete is formed (discussed in Chapter 5), the genome of each individual who has inherited the mutation will be a unique recombinational mosaic of segments inherited from a large number of ancestors. The selected mutation along with a modest amount of neighboring sequence\u2014ultimately inherited from the individual in which the mutation occurred\u2014will simply be one piece of this huge mosaic."

The spread of neutral mutations is not as rapid as the spread of the rare strongly advantageous mutations.

One attractive theory to explain such an end result imagines that different, mildly deleterious mutations occur quickly in both copies of a duplicated gene set. For example, one copy might lose expression in a particular tissue as a result of a regulatory mutation, while the other copy loses expression in a second tissue. Following such an occurrence, both gene copies would be required to provide the full range of functions that were once supplied by a single gene; hence, both copies would now be protected from loss through inactivating mutations.

Alfred Knudson hypothesized that hereditary retinoblastoma involves two mutations, of which one is germ-line and one somatic, whereas nonhereditary retinoblastoma is due to two somatic mutations (Fig. 10-12).53 Thus, both heredi-tary and nonhereditary forms of retinoblastoma involve the same number of mutations, a hypothesis known as Knudson\u2019s \u201ctwo-hit\u201d hypothesis. A \u201chit\u201d may be a point mutation, a chro-mosomal deletion referred to as allelic loss, or a loss of hetero-zygosity, or silencing of an existing gene. Approximately 40% of retinoblastomas are hereditary and due to germline mutations in the RB1 gene. Children with hereditary RB are also at risk for developing a midline intracranial tumor, most commonly pineoblastoma.p53 and Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) was first defined on the basis of observed clustering of malignancies, including early-onset breast cancer, soft tissue sarcomas, brain tumors,"

            "content": "What is the fate of newly duplicated genes? In most cases, there is presumed to be little or no selection\u2014at least initially\u2014to maintain the duplicated state since either copy can provide an equivalent function. Hence, many duplication events are likely to be followed by loss-of-function mutations in one or the other gene. This cycle would functionally restore the one-gene state that preceded the duplication. Indeed, there are many examples in contemporary genomes where one copy of a duplicated gene can be seen to have become irreversibly inactivated by multiple mutations. Over time, the sequence similarity between such a pseudogene and the functional gene whose duplication produced it would be expected to be eroded by the accumulation of many mutations in the pseudogene\u2014the homologous relationship eventually becoming undetectable."
