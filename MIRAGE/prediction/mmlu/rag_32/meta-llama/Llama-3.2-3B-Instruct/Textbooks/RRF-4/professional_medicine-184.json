The anal canal is part of the rectum and receives lymphatic drainage from the rectum, which ultimately drains into the inferior mesenteric lymph nodes. The inferior mesenteric lymph nodes are located along the aorta, below the renal arteries, and include the internal iliac nodes. Therefore, evaluating the internal iliac lymph nodes would be the most appropriate choice for possible metastasis from a malignant anal mass.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

A prostatic abscess may present with similar complaints, including dysuria. Patients with a prostatic abscess will often have a history of recurrent sexually transmitted diseases. On physical examination, a large fluctuant area is usually readily visible. Routine laboratory evaluation shows an elevated white blood cell count. Diagnostic procedures are rarely necessary unless evaluating a recurrent abscess. A CT scan or MRI has an accuracy of 80% in determining incomplete drainage. If there is a concern about the presence of inflammatory bowel disease, a rigid or flexible sigmoidoscopic examination may be done at the time of drainage to evaluate for inflammation within the rectosigmoid region. A more complete evaluation for Crohn\u2019s disease would include a full colonoscopy and small-bowel series."

Hemorrhoidal bleeding is described as painless bright red blood seen either in the toilet or upon wiping. Occasional patients can present with significant bleeding, which may be a cause of anemia; however, the presence of a colonic neoplasm must be ruled out in anemic patients.

An evaluation for the presence of metastatic disease, including a thorough physical examination, biochemical assessment of liver function, measurement of the plasma CEA level, and a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, should be performed before surgery. When possible, a colonoscopy of the entire large bowel should be performed to identify synchronous neoplasms and/or polyps. The detection of metastases should not preclude surgery in patients with tumor-related symptoms such as gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction, but it often prompts the use of a less radical operative procedure. The necessity for a primary tumor resection in asymptomatic individuals with metastatic disease is an area of controversy. At the time of laparotomy, the entire peritoneal cavity should be examined, with thorough inspection of the liver, pelvis, and hemidiaphragm and careful palpation of the"

In addition, with advances in imaging technology, previously undetected lesions not infre-quently are now identified. Although many of these lesions are benign and will require no further treatment, the concern for malignancy requires a thorough evaluation. Thus, an orderly approach should be taken to the workup of an incidental liver lesion to minimize unnecessary testing.70The evaluation of an incidental liver mass begins with a history and physical examination (Fig. 31-17). The patient should be asked about abdominal pain, weight loss, previous Figure 31-17. Algorithm for diagnostic workup of an incidental liver lesion.
