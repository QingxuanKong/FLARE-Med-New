Chromosome numbers such as 3n and 4n are called polyploid. Polyploidy generally results in a spontaneous abortion. Any number that is not an exact multiple of n is called aneuploid. The chief cause of aneuploidy is nondisjunction of a homologous pair of chromosomes at the first meiotic division or a failure of sister chromatids to separate during the second meiotic division. The latter also may occur during mitosis in somatic cells, leading to the production of two aneuploid cells. Failure of pairing of homologous chromosomes followed by random assortment (anaphase lag) also can lead to aneuploidy. When nondisjunction occurs at the time of meiosis, the gametes formed have either an extra chromosome (n + 1) or one less chromosome (n \u2212 1).

            "content": "Here, homologous recombination occurs as an integral part of the process whereby chromosomes are parceled out to germ cells (sperm and eggs in animals). We discuss the process of meiosis in detail in Chapter 17; in the following sections, we discuss how homologous recombination during meiosis produces chromosome crossing-over and gene conversion, resulting in hybrid chromosomes that contain genetic information from both the maternal and paternal homologs (Figure 5\u201353). Crossing-over and gene conversion are both generated by homologous recombination mechanisms that, at their core, resemble those used to repair double-strand breaks. Meiotic Recombination Begins with a Programmed Double-Strand Break"

Rieder.) 17\u201313 Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) are the most common autosomal trisomies seen in human infants. Does this fact mean that these chromosomes are the most difficult to segregate properly during meiosis? 17\u201314 The human genome consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes). During meiosis, the maternal and paternal sets of homologs pair, and then are separated into gametes, so that each contains 23 chromosomes. If you assume that the chromosomes in the paired homologs are randomly assorted to daughter cells, how many potential combinations of paternal and maternal homologs can be generated during meiosis? (For the purposes of this calculation, assume that no recombination occurs.)"

            "content": "(a) meiosis is a form of nuclear division in which a single round of chromosome duplication (meiotic s phase) is followed by two rounds of chromosome segregation. The duplicated homologs, each consisting of tightly bound sister chromatids, pair up and are segregated into different daughter nuclei in meiosis I; the sister chromatids are segregated in meiosis II. as indicated by the formation of chromosomes that are partly red and partly gray, homolog pairing in meiosis leads to genetic recombination (crossing-over) during meiosis I. Each diploid cell that enters meiosis therefore produces four genetically different haploid nuclei, which are distributed by cytokinesis into haploid cells that differentiate into gametes. (B) In mitosis, by contrast, homologs do not pair up, and the sister chromatids are segregated during the single division. Thus, each diploid cell that divides by mitosis produces two genetically identical diploid daughter nuclei, which are distributed by cytokinesis into"
