He says, \"I cannot go more than a day without cigarettes because I get so anxious and irritable. I even wake up at night to smoke.\" The patient began smoking cigarettes at age 12 years; he was smoking two packs of cigarettes daily by age 17 years, and he has not curtailed his use since that time. He does not drink alcoholic beverages or use illicit drugs. Medical history is remarkable for childhood febrile seizures. He takes no medications. Vital signs are normal. The patient is interested in using a nicotine patch and bupropion therapy because he says his friend found the treatments to be helpful.

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Recently, two partial agonists of \u03b14\u03b22-containing nAChRs have been characterized: the plant-extract cytisine and its synthetic derivative varenicline. Both work by occupying nAChRs on dopamine neurons of the VTA, thus preventing nicotine from exerting its action.

Approximately 70\u201380% of smokers would like to quit smoking. More than one-half of current smokers attempted to quit in the last year, but only 6% quit for 6 months, and only 3% remain abstinent for 2 years. Clinician-based smoking interventions should repeatedly encourage smokers to try to quit and to use different forms of cessation assistance with each new cessation attempt rather than focusing exclusively on immediate cessation at the time of the first visit. Advice from a physician to quit smoking, particularly at the time of an acute illness, is a powerful trigger for cessation attempts, with up to half of patients who are advised to quit making a cessation effort. Other triggers include the cost of cigarettes, media campaigns, and changes in rules to restrict smoking in the workplace."

A hypoxemic poisoning syndrome seen in patients who have been exposed to automobile exhaust, smoke inhalation, barbecues, or old appliances in poorly ventilated locations. Presents with hypoxemia, cherry-red skin (rare), confusion, and headaches. Coma or seizures occur in severe cases. Chronic low-level exposure may cause \ufb02 ulike symptoms with generalized myalgias, nausea, and headaches. Ask about symptoms in others living in the same house. Suspect smoke inhalation in the presence of singed nose hairs, facial burns, hoarseness, wheezing, or carbonaceous sputum. Check an ABG and serum carboxyhemoglobin level (normal is < 5% in nonsmokers and < 10% in smokers). Check an ECG in the elderly and in patients with a history of cardiac disease."

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

Symptoms of opioid withdrawal begin 8\u201310 h after the last dose; lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, and sweating appear first. Restless sleep followed by weakness, chills, gooseflesh (\u201ccold turkey\u201d), nausea and vomiting, muscle aches, and involuntary movements (\u201ckicking the habit\u201d), hyperpnea, hyperthermia, and hypertension occur in later stages of the withdrawal syndrome.

For muscarinic effects, administer atropine (0.5\u20135 mg) intrave-nously until signs of muscarinic excess (dyspnea, lacrimation, confusion) subside. To treat nicotinic excess, infuse 2-PAM (initially a 1\u20132% solution in 15\u201330 minutes) followed by infu-sion of 1% solution (200\u2013500 mg/h) until muscle fasciculations cease.
