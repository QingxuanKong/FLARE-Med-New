    "predict": "To find the number of micrograms in each dose, we need to first find the total daily dose in micrograms and then divide it by 3. According to document [0], Ropinirole 1.5 mg is the total daily dose. We need to convert milligrams to micrograms. There are 1000 micrograms in 1 milligram, so: 1.5 mg * 1000 \u03bcg/mg = 1500 \u03bcg Now, we divide the total daily dose in micrograms by 3 to find the dose per administration: 1500 \u03bcg / 3 = 500 \u03bcg Therefore, each dose is 500 \u03bcg. The answer is D.",

It is introduced at 0.25 mg three times daily, and the total daily dose is then increased by 0.75 mg at weekly intervals until the fourth week and by 1.5 mg thereafter. In most instances, a dosage between 2 and 8 mg three times daily is necessary. Ropinirole is metabolized by CYP1A2; other drugs metabolized by this isoform may significantly reduce its clearance. A prolonged-release preparation taken once daily is available."

Miscellaneous Headache, nasal congestion, increased arousal, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural and retroperitoneal fibrosis, and erythromelalgia are other reported adverse effects of the ergot-derived dopamine agonists. Erythromelalgia consists of red, tender, painful, swollen feet and, occasionally, hands, at times associated with arthralgia; symptoms and signs clear within a few days of withdrawal of the causal drug. In rare instances, an uncontrollable tendency to fall asleep at inappropriate times has occurred, particularly in patients receiving pramipexole or ropinirole; this requires discontinuation of the medication. Dopamine agonists are contraindicated in patients with a history of psychotic illness or recent myocardial infarction, or with active peptic ulceration. The ergot-derived agonists are best avoided in patients with peripheral vascular disease."

Graded Dose-Response Relations To choose among drugs and to determine appropriate doses of a drug, the prescriber must know the relative pharmacologic potency and maximal efficacy of the drugs in relation to the desired therapeutic effect. These two important terms, often confusing to students and clinicians, can be explained by referring to Figure 2\u201315, which depicts graded dose-response curves that relate the dose of four different drugs to the magnitude of a particular therapeutic effect. 1."

            "content": "Dopamine agonists These drugs have a direct dopaminergic effect on striatal neurons, thereby partially bypassing the depleted nigral neurons. They have found a place both as the initial treatment, replacing l-dopa in this role, and in modulating the effects of l-dopa later in the illness. However, dopamine agonists are less potent than l-dopa in managing the main features of Parkinson disease and, in higher doses and in older individuals, they produce undesirable motor and cognitive side effects (see further on). They are favored because they are associated with fewer dyskinetic motor complications, or at least, delay the need for l-dopa and its dyskinetic effects. Bromocriptine and lisuride are synthetic ergot derivatives whose action in Parkinson disease is explained by their direct stimulating effect on dopamine (D2) receptors located on striate neurons. The nonergot dopamine agonists ropinirole and pramipexole have a similar type and duration of effectiveness and are used more"

            "content": "Pramipexole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in approximately 2 hours, and is excreted largely unchanged in the urine. It is started at a dosage of 0.125 mg three times daily, doubled after 1 week, and again after another week. Further increments in the daily dose are by 0.75 mg at weekly intervals, depending on response and tolerance. Most patients require between 0.5 and 1.5 mg three times daily. Renal insufficiency may necessitate dosage adjustment. An extended-release preparation is now available and is taken once daily at a dose equivalent to the total daily dose of standard pramipexole. The extended-release preparation is generally more convenient for patients and avoids swings in blood levels of the drug over the day."

            "content": "Treatment is with drugs that block dopamine receptors or deplete dopamine stores, such as fluphenazine, pimozide, and tetrabenazine. These drugs reduce the frequency and intensity of tics by about 60%. Pimozide, a dopamine receptor antagonist, may be helpful in patients as a first-line treatment or in those who are either unresponsive to or intolerant of the other agents mentioned. Treatment is started at 1 mg/d, and the dosage is increased by 1 mg every 5 days; most patients require 7\u201316 mg/d. It has similar side effects to haloperidol but may cause irregularities of cardiac rhythm. Haloperidol has been used for many years to treat tic disorders. Patients are better able to tolerate this drug if treatment is started with a small dosage (eg, 0.25 or 0.5 mg daily) and then increased gradually (eg, by 0.25 mg every 4 or 5 days) over the following weeks depending on response and tolerance. Most patients ultimately require a total daily dose of 3\u20138 mg. Adverse effects include"

To minimize adverse side effects, prednisone should be given in a single dose rather than in divided doses throughout the day. The initial dose should be relatively low (15\u201325 mg/d) to avoid the early weakening that occurs in up to one-third of patients treated initially with a high-dose regimen. The dose is increased stepwise, as tolerated by the patient (usually by 5 mg/d at 2to 3-day intervals), until there is marked clinical improvement or a dose of 50\u201360 mg/d is reached. This dose is maintained for 1\u20133 months and then is gradually modified to an alternate-day regimen over the course of an additional 1\u20133 months; the goal is to reduce the dose on the \u201coff day\u201d to zero or to a minimal level. Generally, patients begin to improve within a few weeks after reaching the maximum dose, and improvement continues to progress for months or years. The"

The effect of l-dopa may be virtually immediate (i.e., after absorption, which occurs over 30 to 40 min) but there is a further cumulative effect over several days of consistent dosing. The principles that guide the adjustment of dosing (end-of-dose wearing off, dyskinesias, freezing, confusion) are discussed further on."

It has less troublesome adverse effects than reserpine, which has also been used for this purpose. Tetrabenazine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP2D6), and genotyping has therefore been recommended to determine metabolizer status (CYP2D6 expression) in patients needing doses exceeding 50 mg/d. For poor metabolizers, the maximum recommended dose is 50 mg daily (25 mg/dose); otherwise, a maximum dose of 100 mg daily can be used. Treatment with postsynaptic dopamine receptor blockers such as phenothiazines and butyrophenones may also be helpful. Haloperidol is started in a small dose, eg, 1 mg twice daily, and increased every 4 days depending on the response. If haloperidol is not helpful, treatment with increasing doses of fluphenazine in a similar dose, eg, 1 mg twice daily, sometimes helps. Several recent reports suggest that olanzapine may also be useful; the dose"
