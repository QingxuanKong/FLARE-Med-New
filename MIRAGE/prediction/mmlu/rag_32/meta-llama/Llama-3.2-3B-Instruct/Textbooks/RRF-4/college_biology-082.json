Step 1: Identify the primary function of each hormone in the context of calcium homeostasis. - Thyroxine (T4) is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland, primarily involved in regulating metabolism, growth, and development. It is not directly involved in calcium homeostasis. - Glucagon is a hormone produced by the pancreas, involved in raising blood glucose levels. It is not directly involved in calcium homeostasis. - Growth hormone is produced by the pituitary gland and stimulates growth, cell reproduction, and cell regeneration. It is not directly involved in calcium homeostasis. - Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is produced by the parathyroid glands, and its primary function is to maintain extracellular fluid calcium concentration within a narrow normal range. It acts directly on bone and kidney and indirectly on the intestine through its effects on the synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D to increase serum calcium concentrations. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between PTH and calcium homeostasis. - PTH is the primary regulator of calcium physiology, and its secretion is closely regulated by the concentration of serum ionized calcium. A decrease in extracellular calcium triggers an increase in PTH secretion, which in turn results in increased tubular reabsorption of calcium by the kidney, resorption of calcium from bone, and stimulation of renal 1,25(OH)2D production, ultimately leading to increased calcium absorption in the intestine. Step 3: Eliminate incorrect options. - Thyroxine (A) is not directly involved in calcium homeostasis. - Glucagon (B) is not directly involved in calcium homeostasis. - Growth hormone (C) is not directly involved in calcium homeostasis. Step 4: Select the correct option based on the analysis. - Based on the analysis, parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the hormone primarily responsible for maintaining adequate serum levels of calcium.\" \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

When deficiency develops, the drop in ionized calcium in the extracellular fluid results in continuous excitation of muscle (tetany).

            "content": "This effect of hypercalcemia occurs because an elevated plasma [Ca++] causes the threshold potential to shift to less negative values (i.e., farther from the resting membrane voltage). Plasma [Ca++] is regulated within a very narrow range, primarily by parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), the active metabolite of vitamin D3, and plasma Ca++ , and this regulation will be discussed next. Within cells, Ca++ is sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, or it is bound to proteins. Thus the free intracellular [Ca++] is very low (\u2248100 nM). The large concentration gradient for [Ca++] across cell membranes is maintained by a Ca++-ATPase pump (PMCa1b) in all cells and by a 3Na+/Ca++ exchanger (NCX1) in some cells.

            "content": "The function of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is to maintain extracellular fluid calcium concentration. his 84-amino acid hormone acts directly on bone and kidney and indirectly on small intestine through its efects on synthesis of vitamin D (l,25-(OH)2D) to increase serum calcium (Potts, 2015). Secretion is regulated by serum ionized calcium concentration through a negative feedback system. Cacitonin is a potent parathyroid hormone that acts as a physiological parathyroid hormone antagonist. The interrelationships between these hormones, calcium metabolism, and PTH-related protein produced by fetal tissue are discussed in Chapter 4 (p. 71)."

            "content": "Control of the ionized calcium concentration in the ECF ordinarily is accomplished by adjusting the rates of calcium movement across intestinal and renal epithelia. These adjustments are mediated mainly via changes in blood levels of the hormones, PTH and 1,25(OH)2D. Blood ionized calcium directly suppresses PTH secretion by activating calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) in parathyroid cells. Also, ionized 2457 calcium indirectly affects PTH secretion by lowering 1,25(OH)2D production. This active vitamin D metabolite inhibits PTH production by an incompletely understood mechanism of negative feedback (Chap. 424)."

            "content": "PTH levels are undetectable or inappropriately low in severe hypomagnesemia despite the stimulus of severe hypocalcemia, and acute repletion of magnesium leads to a rapid increase in PTH level. Serum phosphate levels are often not elevated, in contrast to the situation with acquired or idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, probably because phosphate deficiency is often seen in hypomagnesmia (Chap. 393). Diminished peripheral responsiveness to PTH also occurs in some patients, as documented by subnormal response in urinary phosphorus and urinary cAMP excretion after administration of exogenous PTH to patients who are hypocalcemic and hypomagnesemic. Both blunted PTH secretion and lack of renal response to administered PTH can occur in the same patient. When acute magnesium repletion is undertaken, the restoration of PTH levels to normal or supra-normal may precede restoration of normal serum calcium by several days."

Phosphate therapy, PO or IV, has a limited role in certain circumstances (Chap. 423). Correcting hypophosphatemia lowers the serum calcium concentration by several mechanisms, including bone/calcium exchange. The usual oral treatment is 1\u20131.5 g of phosphorus per day for several days, given in divided doses. It is generally believed, but not established, that toxicity does not occur if therapy is limited to restoring serum inorganic phosphate concentrations to normal. Raising the serum inorganic phosphate concentration above normal decreases serum calcium levels, sometimes strikingly. Intravenous phosphate is one of the most dramatically effective treatments available for severe hypercalcemia but is toxic and even dangerous (fatal hypocalcemia). For these reasons, it is used rarely and only in"

            "content": "URINE CALCIUM Higher urine calcium excretion increases the likelihood of formation of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones. While the term hypercalciuria is often used, there is no widely accepted cutoff that distinguishes between normal and abnormal urine calcium excretion. In fact, the relation between urine calcium and stone risk appears to be continuous; thus the use of an arbitrary threshold should be avoided. Levels of urine calcium excretion are higher in individuals with a history of nephrolithiasis; however, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Greater gastrointestinal calcium absorption is one important contributor, and greater bone turnover (with a resultant reduction in bone mineral density) may be another. Primary renal calcium loss, with lower serum calcium concentrations and elevated serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) (and a normal 25-hydroxy vitamin D level), is rare."

            "content": "In blood, total calcium concentration is normally 2.2\u20132.6 mM (8.5\u201310.5 mg/dL), of which ~50% is ionized. The remainder is bound ionically to negatively charged proteins (predominantly albumin and immunoglobulins) or loosely complexed with phosphate, citrate, sulfate, or other anions. Alterations in serum protein concentrations directly affect the total blood calcium concentration even if the ionized calcium concentration remains normal. An algorithm to correct for protein changes adjusts the total serum calcium (in mg/dL) upward by 0.8 times the deficit in serum albumin (g/dL) or by 0.5 times the deficit in serum immunoglobulin (in g/dL). Such corrections provide only rough approximations of actual free calcium concentrations, however, and may be misleading, particularly during acute illness. Acidosis also alters ionized calcium by reducing its association with proteins. The best practice is to measure blood ionized calcium directly by a method that employs calcium-selective"
