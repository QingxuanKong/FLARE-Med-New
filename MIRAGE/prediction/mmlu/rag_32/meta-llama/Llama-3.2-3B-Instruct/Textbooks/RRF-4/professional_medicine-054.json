    "question": "A phase 2, multicenter trial was conducted to determine the efficacy of a new vaccine for prevention of HIV infection. The study enrolled 4000 subjects, aged 20 to 65 years. Of these subjects, 2100 were men and 1900 were women; 2500 were white, 1000 were African American, 300 were Hispanic, and 200 were Asian/Pacific Islanders. Results of the trial showed no overall benefit of the vaccine. However, post hoc analysis disclosed a small but statistically significant vaccine protection among African American subjects. Which of the following is the most accurate rationale for questioning the validity of efficacy analysis of the HIV vaccine among the African American study subjects?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To address this question, we must consider the potential biases and limitations that could affect the efficacy analysis of the HIV vaccine among African American study subjects. The first step is to evaluate each option in light of the provided information.\\n\\nOption A: HIV infection is more prevalent among African American populations. While it is true that HIV infection is more prevalent among African American populations, this does not necessarily invalidate the efficacy analysis. The prevalence of HIV infection does not directly impact the validity of the efficacy analysis, as long as the study was conducted in a controlled manner.\\n\\nOption B: The study was not blinded. Blinded studies are considered the gold standard in clinical trials, but they are not a requirement for efficacy analysis. As long as the study was conducted with proper controls and randomization, the lack of blinding does not necessarily invalidate the results.\\n\\nOption C: There was a Type II error. A Type II error occurs when a study fails to detect an effect when one is present. However, without more information about the sample size and statistical power of the study, it is difficult to determine whether a Type II error occurred. This option requires more specific information to be evaluated.\\n\\nOption D: Vaccine response among African American subjects was not the primary outcome measure. This option is a strong candidate for the correct answer. If the primary outcome measure was not the vaccine response among African American subjects, then it is possible that the analysis may have been biased towards the non-African American subjects. This would be a significant concern, as the study found a statistically significant vaccine protection among African American subjects. The primary outcome measure should be the vaccine response among African American subjects, not the overall efficacy of the vaccine.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate rationale for questioning the validity of the efficacy analysis of the HIV vaccine among African American study subjects is that the vaccine response among African American subjects was not the primary outcome measure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

However, because of the low risk of transmission of TB in the United States and other high-income countries, the unreliable protection afforded by BCG, and its impact on the TST, the vaccine is not recommended for general use. HIV-infected adults and children should not receive BCG vaccine. Moreover, infants whose HIV status is unknown but who have signs and symptoms consistent with HIV infection or who are born to HIV-infected mothers should not receive BCG. Over the past decade, renewed research and development efforts have been made toward a new TB vaccine. In mid-2014, 16 candidates were in clinical trials and 12 were being field tested. The first new vaccine, for which results of a clinical trial became available in early 2013, is MVA85A/AERAS-485; unfortunately, this viral-vectored vaccine did not show clinical benefit as a booster to BCG."

The effectiveness of a vaccine can, however, only be assessed in a population in which the exposure rate to the virus is high enough to assess whether vaccination protects against infection. This means that initial vaccine trials might have to be conducted in countries where the incidence of infection is very high and public health measures have not yet succeeded in reducing the spread of HIV. 13-38 Prevention and education are important in controlling the spread of HIV and AIDS."

The consensus is that PPSV is effective against IPD but is less effective or ineffective against nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia. However, published trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses contradict this view. Efficacy is often lower in the elderly and in immunodeficient patients whose condition is associated with reduced antibody responses to vaccines than in younger, healthier populations. When PPSV is effective, the duration of protection following a single dose of vaccine is estimated to be ~5 years."

Potentially contributing to, but not explaining entirely, low responsiveness in African Americans are a higher proportion with genotype 1, slower early viral kinetics during therapy, impaired HCV-specific immunity, and recently recognized host genetic differences in IL28B alleles, described below. The response rate in Latino patients is also low, despite the fact that the frequency of the favorable IL28B C allele is as common in Hispanic patients as in whites. Moreover, the likelihood of a sustained response is best if adherence to the treatment regimen is high (i.e., if patients receive \u226580% of the IFN and ribavirin doses and if they continue treatment for \u226580% of the anticipated duration of therapy). Other variables reported to correlate with increased responsiveness include brief duration of infection, low HCV"

This is likely most effective if given while the CD4+ T cell count is >200/\u03bcL and, if given to patients with lower CD4+ T cell counts, should be repeated once the count has been above 200 for 6 months. Although clear guidelines do not exist, it also makes sense to repeat immunization every 5 years. The incidence of bacterial pneumonia is cut in half when patients quit smoking."
