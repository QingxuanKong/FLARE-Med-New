Document [0] states that free fatty acids (FFA) are transported in the circulation in association with serum albumin. This suggests that FFA are bound to albumin in the blood. Document [1] also mentions that free fatty acids are transported to cells through the bloodstream, where they bind to the abundant blood protein, serum albumin. Additionally, Document [4] explains that free fatty acids have an affinity for water due to their anionic group, which has an affinity for water, giving the fatty acid its amphipathic nature. However, for long-chain-length fatty acids, the hydrophobic portion is predominant, and they are highly water-insoluble. Therefore, they must be transported in the circulation in association with protein, such as albumin. Based on this information, it can be inferred that most of the free fatty acids are transported in the blood bound to albumin. So, the correct answer is D. bound to albumin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Low levels of free fatty acids (FFA) occur in all tissues, but substantial amounts can sometimes be found in the plasma, particularly during fasting. Plasma FFA (transported on serum albumin) are in route from their point of origin (TAG of adipose tissue or circulating lipoproteins) to their site of consumption (most tissues). FFA can be oxidized by many tissues, particularly liver and muscle, to provide energy and, in the liver, to provide the substrate for ketone body synthesis. Fatty acids are also structural components of membrane lipids, such as phospholipids and glycolipids (see p. 201). Fatty acids attached to certain proteins enhance the ability of those proteins to associate with membranes (see p. 206).

If free hormone levels drop, hormone will be released from the transport proteins. This relationship may be expressed as follows: Equation 38.1 where [H] = concentration of free hormone, [P] = concentration of plasma transport protein, [HP] = concentration of bound hormone, and K = the dissociation constant."

            "content": "Lipid is an important muscle energy source during rest and during prolonged, submaximal exercise. Fatty acids are derived from circulating very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) in the blood or from triglycerides stored in muscle fibers. Oxidation of fatty acids occurs in the mitochondria. To enter the mitochondria, a fatty acid must first be converted to an \u201cactivated fatty acid,\u201d acyl-CoA. The acyl-CoA must be linked with carnitine by the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) I for transport into the mitochondria. CPT I is present on the inner side of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Carnitine is removed by CPT II, an enzyme attached to the inside of the inner mitochondrial membrane, allowing transport of acyl-CoA into the mitochondrial matrix for \u03b2-oxidation."

HDL also acquires cholesterol from peripheral tissues, protecting the cholesterol homeostasis of cells. Free cholesterol is chiefly exported from the cell membrane by a transporter, ABCA1, acquired by a small particle termed prebeta-1 HDL, and then esterified by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), leading to the formation of larger HDL species. Cholesterol is also exported by the ABCG1 transporter and the scavenger receptor, SR-BI, to large HDL particles. The cholesteryl esters are transferred to VLDL, IDL, LDL, and chylomicron"

Normally, these free fatty acids are converted to triglycerides or very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) in the liver. However, in DKA, hyperglucagonemia alters hepatic metabolism to favor ketone body formation, through activation of the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. This enzyme is crucial for regulating fatty acid transport into the mitochondria, where beta oxidation and conversion to ketone bodies occur. At physiologic pH, ketone bodies exist as ketoacids, which are neutralized by bicarbonate. As bicarbonate stores are depleted, metabolic acidosis ensues. Increased lactic acid production also contributes to the acidosis. The increased free fatty acids increase triglyceride and VLDL production. VLDL clearance is also reduced because the activity of insulin-sensitive lipoprotein lipase in muscle and fat is decreased. Hypertriglyceridemia may be severe enough to cause pancreatitis."

In addition, muscle cells can store triglycerides, which can be hydrolyzed when needed to produce fatty acids. The fatty acids are subjected to \u03b2 oxidation within the mitochondria. For fatty acids to enter the mitochondria, however, they are converted to acylcarnitine in the cytosol and then transported into the mitochondria, where they are converted to acyl coenzyme A (CoA). Within the mitochondria, the acyl CoA is subjected to \u03b2 oxidation and yields acetyl CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle and ultimately produces ATP."
