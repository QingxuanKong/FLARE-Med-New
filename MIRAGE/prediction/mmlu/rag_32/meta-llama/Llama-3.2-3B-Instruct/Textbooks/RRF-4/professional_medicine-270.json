The patient says he does not have any symptoms. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. His only current medication is haloperidol. The patient is not in acute distress. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Mental status examination discloses a flat affect, distractibility, and derailment of thoughts. X-ray of the abdomen is obtained and shows a 4-cm nail in the left upper quadrant. No free air is visible. After admitting the patient to the hospital, which of the following is the most appropriate management?",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has swallowed a nail and presents to the emergency department with no acute symptoms. The primary concern is the potential for the nail to cause esophageal perforation or obstruction. The patient is not in acute distress, and vital signs are normal. The mental status examination shows flat affect, distractibility, and derailment of thoughts, which is consistent with schizophrenia. The abdominal X-ray shows a 4-cm nail in the left upper quadrant, but no free air is visible, suggesting that the nail has not caused an perforation. The most appropriate management would be to monitor the patient closely for signs of esophageal perforation or obstruction and consider endoscopic removal of the nail if necessary. Administration of ipecac to induce vomiting is not recommended as it may cause further irritation and increase the risk of perforation. Open laparotomy and removal of the nail through a gastrotomy incision may be considered if endoscopic removal is not feasible or if signs of perforation or obstruction develop. Observation alone is not sufficient due to the potential risks associated with the swallowed object.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

It was believed she was beginning to show signs of schizophrenia and she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where she was started on antipsychotic medications. While in the hospital, she had a generalized seizure which prompted her transfer to our service. Her spinal fluid analysis showed 10 lymphocytes per mL3. She was found to have an anti-NMDA receptor antibody, which prompted an ultrasound examination of the pelvis. The left ovary was thought to show a benign cyst.

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

The patient can often give the exact time of onset of the excruciating abdominal pain. Initially, a chemical peritonitis develops from the gastric and/or duodenal secretions, but within hours a bacterial peritonitis supervenes. The patient is in obvi-ous distress, and the abdominal examination shows peritoneal signs. Usually, marked involuntary guarding and rebound ten-derness is evoked by a gentle examination. Upright chest X-ray shows free air in about 80% of patients (Fig. 26-32). Once the diagnosis has been made, the patient is given analgesia and antibiotics, resuscitated with isotonic fluid, and taken to the operating room. Fluid sequestration into the third space of the inflamed peritoneum can be impressive, so preoperative fluid resuscitation is mandatory. Sometimes, the perforation has sealed spontaneously by the time of presentation, and surgery can"

A 33-year-old man was playing cricket for his local Sunday team. As the new bowler pitched the ball short, it bounced higher than he anticipated and hit him on the side of his head. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious, but after about 30 seconds he was helped to his feet and felt otherwise well. It was noted he had some bruising around his temple. He decided not to continue playing and went to watch the match from the side. Over the next hour he became extremely sleepy and was eventually unrousable. He was rushed to hospital. When he was admitted to hospital, the patient\u2019s breathing was shallow and irregular and it was necessary to intubate him. A skull radiograph demonstrated a fracture in the region of the pterion. No other abnormality was demonstrated other than minor soft tissue bruising over the left temporal fossa. A CT scan was performed."

The patient talks in nonsensical phrases, appears confused, and does not fully comprehend what is said to him. He may perform satisfactorily at a superficial level and offer socially appropriate greetings and gestures. Only scrutiny of language function and behavior will lead to the correct diagnosis. Infarction of the dominant or nondominant temporal lobe and rarely of the caudate may produce an agitated delirium with few focal findings. This may be mistaken for a toxic or withdrawal state."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

After admission a bronchoscopy was carried out and sputum was aspirated from the left upper lobe bronchus. This was cultured in the laboratory and also viewed under the microscope and tuberculous bacilli (TB) were identified. A 68-year-old man came to his family physician complaining of discomfort when swallowing (dysphagia). The physician examined the patient and noted since his last visit he had lost approximately 18 lb over 6 months. Routine blood tests revealed the patient was anemic and he was referred to the gastroenterology unit. A diagnosis of esophageal cancer was made and the patient underwent a resection, which involved a chest and abdominal incision. After 4 years the patient remains well though still subject to follow-up."
