    "question": "During a study of renal glomeruli, a healthy animal kidney is kept in a vascular bath preparation at a constant afferent arterial pressure of 100 mm Hg. If the efferent arteriole is constricted with a vascular clamp, which of the following Starling forces is most likely to change in the glomeruli?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which Starling force is most likely to change in the glomeruli when the efferent arteriole is constricted, we need to understand the relationship between the efferent arteriole and the Starling forces in the glomeruli. The Starling forces in the glomeruli include the hydrostatic pressure (PGC), oncotic pressure (\\u03c0GC), and the filtration coefficient (Kf), as well as the reflection coefficient (\\\\sigma) for protein across the glomerular capillary. The hydrostatic pressure (PGC) is the pressure difference between the glomerular capillary and Bowman's space, the oncotic pressure (\\u03c0GC) is the oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillary, and the filtration coefficient (Kf) is a measure of the surface area available for filtration. The reflection coefficient (\\\\sigma) is the ratio of the oncotic pressure to the hydrostatic pressure. When the efferent arteriole is constricted, the resistance to blood flow out of the glomerulus increases, which reduces the hydrostatic pressure within the glomerular capillary (PGC). This reduction in PGC will decrease the oncotic pressure (\\u03c0GC) in the glomerular capillary because the oncotic pressure is proportional to the hydrostatic pressure. The filtration coefficient (Kf) is not directly affected by the constriction of the efferent arteriole. Therefore, the Starling force that is most likely to change in the glomeruli when the efferent arteriole is constricted is the oncotic pressure (\\u03c0GC). The oncotic pressure (\\u03c0GC) is most likely to decrease in the glomeruli when the efferent arteriole is constricted because the constriction of the efferent arteriole reduces the hydrostatic pressure within the glomerular capillary, which in turn reduces the oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillary. This reduction in oncotic pressure will decrease the amount of fluid being filtered across the glomerulus, which is known as the Starling force. So, the answer is C. Decreased oncotic pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

This aspect of function of the juxtaglomerular apparatus is considered in detail in Because animals engage in many activities that can change arterial blood pressure, mechanisms that maintain RBF and GFR relatively constant despite changes in arterial pressure are highly desirable. If GFR and RBF were to rise or fall suddenly in proportion to changes in blood pressure, urinary excretion of fluid and solute would also change suddenly. Such changes in excretion of water and solutes without comparable changes in intake would alter fluid and electrolyte balance (the reason for which is discussed in ). Accordingly, autoregulation of GFR and RBF provides an effective means for uncoupling renal function from arterial pressure, and it ensures that fluid and solute excretion remain relatively constant."

GFR also changes in pathophysiological conditions because of changes in PGC, \u03c0GC, and PBS. 1. Changes in Kf: Increased Kf enhances GFR, whereas decreased Kf reduces GFR. Some kidney diseases reduce Kf by decreasing the number of filtering glomeruli (i.e., diminished surface area). Some drugs and hormones that dilate the glomerular arterioles also increase Kf. Similarly, drugs and hormones that constrict the glomerular arterioles also decrease Kf. 2. Changes in PGC: With decreased renal perfusion, GFR declines because PGC falls. As previously discussed, a reduction in PGC is caused by a decline in renal arterial pressure, an increase in afferent arteriolar resistance, or a decrease in efferent arteriolar resistance. 3."

Two mechanisms are responsible for autoregulation of RBF and GFR: one mechanism that responds to changes in arterial pressure and another that responds to changes in [NaCl] in tubular fluid. Both regulate the tone of the afferent arteriole. The pressure-sensitive mechanism, the so-called myogenic mechanism, is related to an intrinsic property of vascular smooth muscle: the tendency to contract when stretched. Accordingly, when arterial pressure rises and the renal afferent arteriole is stretched, the smooth muscle contracts in response. Because the increase in resistance of the arteriole offsets the increase in pressure, RBF, and therefore GFR, remains constant. (That is, RBF is constant if \u0394P/R is kept constant [see Eq. 33.11"

Autoregulation of glomerular filtration is the result of three major factors that modulate either afferent or efferent arteriolar tone: these include an autonomous vasoreactive (myogenic) reflex in the afferent arteriole, tubuloglomerular feedback, and angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole. The myogenic reflex is a first line of defense against fluctuations in renal blood flow. Acute changes in renal perfusion pressure evoke reflex constriction or dilatation of the afferent arteriole in response to increased or decreased pressure, respectively. This phenomenon helps protect the glomerular capillary from sudden changes in systolic pressure."

            "content": "2. The reabsorption of Na+ decreases in the proximal tubule and loop of Henle. Several mechanisms reduce Na+ reabsorption by the proximal tubule. Because activation of the sympathetic nerve fibers that innervate this nephron segment stimulates proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption, the decreased sympathetic nerve activity that results from ECFV expansion decreases Na+ reabsorption. In addition, angiotensin II directly stimulates Na+ reabsorption by the proximal tubule. Because angiotensin II levels are also reduced under this condition, proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption decreases as a result. Starling forces across the proximal tubule also change. The elevated hydrostatic pressure within the glomerular capillaries in ECFV expansion also tends to increase the hydrostatic pressure within the peritubular capillaries. In addition the decrease in filtration fraction reduces the peritubular oncotic pressure. These alterations in the capillary Starling forces (i.e., hydrostatic and oncotic) reduce"

Why do hormones influence renal blood flow despite autoregulation? Overview of Renal Function The kidney presents in the highest degree the phenomenon of sensibility, the power of reacting to various stimuli in a direction, which is appropriate for the survival of the organism; a power of adaptation which almost gives one the idea that its component parts must be endowed with intelligence. E. STARLING\u20141909 Certainly, mental integrity is a sine qua non of the free and independent life. But let the composition of our internal environment suffer change, let our kidneys fail for even a short time to fulfill their tasks, and our mental integrity, or personality is destroyed."

Conversely, an increase in perfusion pressure inhibits renin release. 2. Sympathetic nerve activity. Activation of the sympathetic nerve fibers that innervate the afferent arterioles increases renin secretion (mediated by \u03b2-adrenergic receptors). CHAPTER 35 Control of Body Fluid Osmolality and Volume Renin secretion is decreased as renal sympathetic nerve activity is decreased."

            "content": "Two mechanisms are responsible for G-T balance. One is related to the oncotic and hydrostatic pressure differences between the peritubular capillaries and the lateral intercellular space (i.e., Starling forces). For example, an increase in the GFR (at constant RPF) raises the protein concentration in glomerular capillary plasma above normal. This protein-rich plasma leaves the glomerular capillaries, flows through the efferent arterioles, and enters the peritubular capillaries. The increased \u03c0pc augments the movement of 1. The four major segments of the nephron (proximal tubule, Henle\u2019s loop, distal tubule, and collecting duct) determine the composition and volume of urine by the processes of selective reabsorption of solutes and water and secretion of some solutes. 2."

            "content": "Innervation of the Kidneys Renal nerves regulate RBF, GFR, and salt and water reabsorption by the nephron. The nerve supply to the kidneys consists of sympathetic nerve fibers that originate in the celiac plexus. There is no corresponding parasympathetic innervation. Adrenergic fibers innervating the kidneys release norepinephrine and lie adjacent to the smooth muscle cells of the major branches of the renal artery (interlobar, arcuate, and interlobular arteries) as well as the afferent and efferent arterioles. In addition, sympathetic nerves innervate the renin-producing granular cells of the afferent arterioles. Renin secretion is stimulated by increased sympathetic activity. Nerve fibers also innervate the proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule, and collecting duct; activation of these nerves enhances Na+ reabsorption by these nephron segments.
