    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's consider what happens when a sound wave passes from one medium to another with a different density. The key concept here is the speed of sound, which is determined by the properties of the medium. Sound speed is generally higher in less dense media and lower in denser media. However, the speed of sound does not change when it enters a denser medium, but the wavelength and frequency of the sound wave do change. The intensity of the sound wave may also change, but that is not what the question is asking about. The question is asking what does NOT change when the sound exits the first medium and enters a denser medium. Based on the properties of sound waves, the correct answer is the one that does not change in this scenario. Let's examine the options provided. A. velocity - The velocity of sound does not change when it enters a denser medium. B. intensity - The intensity of the sound wave may change when it enters a denser medium, as the sound energy is absorbed or scattered by the denser material. C. frequency - The frequency of the sound wave does change when it enters a denser medium. D. wavelength - The wavelength of the sound wave changes when it enters a denser medium, as the speed of sound decreases and the frequency remains constant. So, the correct answer is C. frequency, as the frequency of the sound wave remains constant when it enters a denser medium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Each pure tone results from a sinusoidal wave at a particular frequency and is characterized not only by its frequency but also, instantaneously, by its amplitude and phase ( Fig. 8.15 ). Most naturally occurring sound, however, is a mixture of pure tones. Noise is unwanted sound and may have any composition of pure tones. Sound propagates at about 335 m/sec in air. The waves are associated with certain pressure changes, called sound pressure. The unit of sound pressure is Newtons per meter squared (N/m2), but sound pressure is more commonly expressed as the sound pressure level (SPL). The unit of SPL is the decibel (dB):"

A decibel (dB) is equal to 20 times the logarithm of the ratio of the sound pressure required to achieve threshold in the patient to the sound pressure required to achieve threshold in a normal-hearing person. Therefore, a change of 6 dB represents doubling of sound pressure, and a change of 20 dB represents a tenfold change in sound pressure. Loudness, which depends on the frequency, intensity, and duration of a sound, doubles with approximately each 10-dB increase in sound pressure level. Pitch, on the other hand, does not directly correlate with frequency. The perception of pitch changes slowly in the low and high frequencies. In the middle tones, which are important for human speech, pitch varies more rapidly with changes in frequency."

The Ear The peripheral auditory apparatus is the ear, which can be subdivided into the external ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear (Fig. 8.17 The external ear includes the pinna and the external auditory meatus (auditory canal). The auditory canal contains glands that secrete cerumen, a waxy protective substance. The pinna helps direct sounds into the auditory canal and plays a role in sound localization. The auditory canal transmits the sound pressure waves to the tympanic membrane. In humans, the auditory canal has a resonant frequency of about 3500Hz, and this resonance contributes to the low perceptual threshold for sounds in that range."

A sound of specified frequency causes displacement of a relatively long segment of the basilar membrane, but the region of maximal displacement is narrow. The point of maximal displacement of the basilar membrane is specified for a given frequency of sound and is the morphologic basis of frequency discrimination. High-frequency sounds cause maximal vibration of the basilar membrane near the base of the cochlea; low-frequency sounds cause maximal displacement nearer the apex. Amplitude discrimination (i.e., perception of sound intensity or loudness) depends on the degree of displacement of the basilar membrane at any given frequency range. Thus, coding acoustic information into nerve impulses depends on the vibratory pattern of the basilar membrane. Movement of the stereocilia of the hair cells in the cochlea initiates neuronal transduction."

If the tone is much more than 1 kHz, a single fiber cannot discharge with every cycle, but phase locking can also occur for sounds with periods shorter than the absolute refractory period of the afferent fiber. This allows the CNS to detect higher frequency information from the activity of a population of afferent fibers, each of which discharges in phase with the stimulus and which, as a group, signal the frequency of the stimulus (see Fig. 8.22B ). This observation is the basis of the frequency theory of hearing. For still higher frequencies (>5000 Hz), the place theory dominates: the CNS interprets sounds that activate afferent fibers supplying hair cells near the base of the cochlea as being of high frequency. Thus both the place and the frequency theories are necessary to explain the frequency coding of sound (duplex theory) across the entire range from 20 to 20,000 Hz."

Therefore, without a special device for impedance matching, most sound reaching the ear would simply be reflected, as are voices from shore when a person is swimming under water. Impedance matching in the ear depends on (1) the ratio of the surface area of the large tympanic membrane advantage of the lever system formed by the ossicles. This impedance matching is sufficient to increase the efficiency of energy transfer by nearly 30 dB in the range of hearing from 300 to 3500 Hz."

Because the heads of the malleus and incus articulate with each other, the head of the incus is also moved laterally. This pushes the long process of the incus medially. The long process articulates with the stapes, so its movement causes the stapes to move medially.

In addition to contributing to the formation of the scala media with the vestibular membrane, the basilar membrane separates the cochlea into the scala vestibuli and scala tympani, which are filled with perilymph and are continuous with one another at the helicotrema (eFig. 9.80)."

            "content": "The middle ear works as a full-fledged mechanical energy transformer. Its primary function is to convert sound waves (air vibrations) arriving from the external acoustic meatus into mechanical vibrations that are transmitted to the internal ear. Two openings in the medial wall of the middle ear, the oval (vestibular) window and the round (cochlear) window, are essential components in this conversion process. The tympanic membrane separates the external acoustic meatus from the middle ear."

            "content": "Duration and Character The duration of a heart murmur depends on the length of time over which a pressure difference exists between two cardiac chambers, the left ventricle and the aorta, the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, or the great vessels. The magnitude and variability of this pressure difference, coupled with the geometry and compliance of the involved chambers or vessels, dictate the velocity of flow; the degree of turbulence; and the resulting frequency, configuration, and intensity of the murmur. The diastolic murmur of chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) is a blowing, high-frequency event, whereas the murmur of mitral stenosis (MS), indicative of the left atrial\u2013left ventricular diastolic pressure gradient, is a low-frequency event, heard as a rumbling sound with the bell of the stethoscope. The frequency components of a heart murmur may vary at different sites of auscultation. The coarse systolic murmur of aortic stenosis (AS) may sound higher pitched and more"

            "content": "he human body is composed of billions of cells, each with a distinct function. However, the function of cells is tightly coordinated and integrated by external chemical signals, including hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, odorants, and products of cellular metabolism that serve as chemical messengers and provide cell-to-cell communication. Mechanical and thermal stimuli and light are physical external signals that also coordinate cellular function. Chemical and physical messengers interact with receptors located in the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus. Interaction of these messengers with receptors initiates a cascade of signaling events that mediate the response to each stimulus. These signaling pathways ensure that the cellular response to external messengers is specific, amplified, tightly regulated, and coordinated. This chapter provides an overview of how cells communicate via external messengers and a discussion of the signaling pathways that process external"
