Document [2] (Title: Histology_Ross) also states that the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm give rise to all the tissues and organs. Document [3] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) mentions that the endoderm forms the gut tube and its appendages, such as lung, pancreas, and liver. Document [17] (Title: Histology_Ross) states that the respiratory system epithelium is of endodermal origin. Document [22] (Title: Histology_Ross) explains that the epithelium of the respiratory system is of endodermal origin. Document [20] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) also states that the epithelial lining of the lower lung and the bladder are normally kept nearly sterile, and a layer of protective mucus covers the respiratory epithelium. Based on these documents, it can be concluded that the lining of the digestive tract and the respiratory tract develops from the endoderm. Therefore, the correct answer is I.

The precursors of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm are arranged in order along the animal-vegetal axis of the blastula: the endoderm derives from the most vegetal blastomeres, the ectoderm from the most animal, and the mesoderm from a middle set. Within each of these territories, the cells have diverse fates according to their positions along the D-V axis of the later embryo. For ectoderm, epidermal precursors are located ventrally, and future neurons are found dorsally; for mesoderm, precursors for notochord, muscle, kidney, and blood are arranged from dorsal to ventral.

During the blastula stages, cells are often totipotent or pluripotent\u2014they have the potential to give rise to all or almost all of the cell types of the adult body. The pluripotency is lost as gastrulation proceeds: a cell located in the endodermal germ layer, for example, can give rise to the cell types that will line the gut or form gut-derived organs such as the liver or pancreas, but it no longer has the potential to form mesoderm-derived structures such as skeleton, heart, or kidney. Such a cell is said to be determined for an endodermal fate. Thus, cell determination starts early and progressively narrows the options as the cell steps through a programmed series of intermediate states\u2014guided at each step by its genome, its history, and its interactions with neighbors.

Furthermore, mesoderm may give rise to carcinomas (epithelial), sarcomas (mesenchymal), and hematolymphoid tumors (leukemias and lymphomas). Carcinomas are subdivided further. Carcinomas that grow in a glandular pattern are called adenocarcinomas, and those that produce squamous cells are called squamous cell carcinomas. Sometimes the tissue or organ of origin can be identified, as in the designation of renal cell adenocarcinoma, but it is not uncommon for tumors http://ebooksmedicine.net Fig. 6.1 Colonicpolyp.Thisglandulartumorisseenprojectingintothecoloniclumen.Thepolypisattachedtothemucosabyadistinctstalk."

Patterning must therefore be mediated by extracellular signal molecules Figure 21\u201328 Blastula fate map in a frog embryo. the endoderm derives from the most vegetal blastomeres (yellow), the ectoderm from the most animal (blue), and the mesoderm from a middle set (green) that contributes also to endoderm and ectoderm. Different cell types derive from different positions along the dorsoventral axis. Figure 21\u201329 Induction of a secondary axis by the Organizer. an amphibian embryo receives a graft of a small cluster of cells taken from a specific site, called the Organizer region, on the dorsal side of another embryo at the same stage. Signals from the graft organize the behavior of neighboring cells of the host embryo, causing development of a pair of conjoined (Siamese) twins. See Movie 21.4. [after"

            "content": "Stem-cell systems are organized in many different ways, but they share some underlying principles. Consider the epidermis, for example\u2014the outer, epithelial covering of the body. The epidermis undergoes continual renewal, but, unlike the lining of the gut, it is multilayered or stratified. Stem cells are located in the basal layer, and their progeny move outward toward the exposed surface, differentiating as they go. They end up as lifeless scales or squames, which are eventually shed from the surface of the skin (Figure 22\u201310). Even though the architecture of this tissue is very different from that of the intestine, many of the same basic principles apply. The stem cells depend for their existence on signals from a specific niche, in this case the basal lamina and underlying connective tissue. The daughters of stem cells that are committed to differentiation undergo several divisions as transit amplifying cells (while still in the basal layer) before differentiating. Finally, a"

            "content": "a component of the visceral peritoneum.DEVELOPMENTThe first recognizable precursor of the small intestine is the embryonic gut tube, formed from the endoderm during the fourth week of gestation. The gut tube is divided into forgut, midgut, and hindgut. Other than the duodenum, which is a forgut structure, the rest of the small intestine is derived from the midgut. The gut tube initially communicates with the yolk sac; however, the communication between these two struc-tures narrows by the sixth week to form the vitelline duct. The yolk sac and vitelline duct usually undergo obliteration by the end of gestation. Incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct results in the spectrum of defects associated with Meckel\u2019s diverticuli.Also during the fourth week of gestation, the mesoderm of the embryo splits. The portion of mesoderm that adheres to the endoderm forms the visceral peritoneum, while the portion that adheres to the ectoderm forms the parietal peritoneum. This mesodermal"
