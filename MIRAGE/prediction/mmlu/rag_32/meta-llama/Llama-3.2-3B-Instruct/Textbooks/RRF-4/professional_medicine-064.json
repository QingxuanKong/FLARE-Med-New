PAH is characterized by elevated pulmonary artery pressure, which can lead to right ventricular hypertrophy and strain. The physical examination findings that are most specific for PAH include an accentuated P2 sound, which is a louder than normal pulmonary component of the second heart sound, and a prominent S3 heart sound, which indicates ventricular volume overload. However, in the context of pulmonary embolism, the most specific indicator of PAH is the accentuated P2 sound, as it suggests elevated pulmonary artery pressure. Increased jugular venous pressure (A) and peripheral edema (C) are non-specific findings that can be seen in right heart failure, while a presence of an S3 (D) can be seen in both left and right heart failure. Therefore, the most specific indicator of PAH in this patient is the louder than normal P2 sound.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Tachypnea, tachycardia, and fever. Exam may reveal a loud P2 and prominent jugular A waves with right heart failure. Venous thrombosis: Unilateral swelling; cords on the calf. ABGs: Respiratory alkalosis (2\u00b0 hyperventilation) with PO2 < 80 mmHg. CXR: Usually normal, but may show atelectasis, pleural effusion, Hampton\u2019s hump (a wedge-shaped infarct), or Westermark\u2019s sign (oligemia in the affected lung zone). ECG: Not diagnostic; most commonly reveals sinus tachycardia. The classic triad of S1Q3T3\u2014acute right heart strain with an S wave in lead I, a Q wave in lead III, and an inverted T wave in lead III\u2014is uncommon."

            "content": "Classically, thrombosis involving the lower extremity is abrupt in onset, and there is pain and edema of the leg and thigh. The thrombus typically involves much of the deepvenous system to the iliofemoral region. Occasionally, relex arterial spasm causes a pale, cool extremity with diminished pulsations. Alternatively, there may be appreciable clot, yet little pain, heat, or swelling. Importantly, calf pain, either spontaneous or in response to squeezing or to Achilles tendon stretching-Homans sign-may be caused by a strained muscle or contusion. Between 30 and 60 percent of women with a confirmed lower-extremity acute deep-vein thrombosis have an asymptomatic pulmonary embolism (p. 1016)."

            "content": "The most common cause of right HF is not pulmonary parenchymal or vascular disease but left HF. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the patient for LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction. The ECG in severe pulmonary hypertension shows P pulmonale, right axis deviation, and RV hypertrophy. Radiographic examination of the chest may show enlargement of the main central pulmonary arteries and hilar vessels. Spirometry and lung volumes can identify obstructive and/ or restrictive defects indicative of parenchymal lung diseases; arterial blood gases can demonstrate hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia. Spiral computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest are useful in diagnosing acute thromboembolic disease; however, ventilation-perfusion lung scanning remains best suited for diagnosing chronic thromboembolic disease (Chap. 300). A high-resolution CT scan of the chest can identify interstitial lung disease."
