Gas exchange occurs in the alveoli, where oxygen is absorbed into the blood and carbon dioxide is removed. The alveoli are small, balloon-like structures located at the end of the bronchioles, and they are surrounded by a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. The capillaries are responsible for transporting the oxygen and carbon dioxide between the alveoli and the bloodstream. The bronchi and bronchioles are airways that carry air in and out of the lungs, but they are not directly involved in gas exchange. Therefore, the correct answer is the component that is directly involved in gas exchange.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Red blood cells pass through the capillary component of this network in single file in less than 1 second, which is sufficient time for CO2 and O2 gas exchange. In addition to gas exchange, the alveolar-capillary network regulates the amount of fluid within the lung. At the pulmonary capillary level, the balance between hydrostatic and oncotic pressure across the wall of the capillary results in a small net movement of fluid out of the vessels into the interstitial space. The fluid is then removed from the lung interstitium by the lymphatic system and enters the circulation via the vena cava in the area of the lung hilus. In normal adults, an average of 30 mL of fluid per hour is returned to the circulation via this route."

The rate of diffusion of a gas through a liquid is described by Graham\u2019s law, which states that the rate is directly proportional to the solubility coefficient of the gas and inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular weight. Calculation of the diffusion properties for O2 and CO2 reveals that CO2 diffuses approximately 20 times faster than O2. Rates of O2 diffusion from the lungs into blood and from blood into tissue, and vice versa for CO2, are predicted by Fick\u2019s law of gas diffusion ( Fig. 24.2). The ratio AD:T represents the con ductance of a gas from the alveolus to blood. The diffusing capacity of the lung (DL) is its conductance (A\u2022D/T) when considered for the entire lung; thus, with Fick\u2019s equation, DL can be calculated as follows:"

To meet the changing metabolic needs of the body, gas exchange depends on the speed at which fresh gas is brought to the alveoli and the rapidity with which the metabolic products of respiration (i.e., CO2) are removed. Two major factors determine the speed at which gas flows into the airways for a given pressure change: the pattern of gas flow and the resistance to airflow by the airways. Patterns of Airflow There are two major patterns of gas flow in the airways\u2014 laminar and turbulent. Laminar flow is parallel to the airway walls and is present at low flow rates. As the flow rate increases and particularly as the airways divide, the flow stream becomes unsteady and small eddies develop.

Furthermore, it must accommodate severalfold increases in the demand for oxygen uptake or CO2 elimination imposed by metabolic needs or acid-base derangement. Given these multiple requirements for normal operation, it is not surprising that many diseases disturb respiratory function.

This process occurs in the lung alveoli, where blood flowing through alveolar wall capillaries is separated from alveolar gas by an extremely thin membrane of flattened endothelial and epithelial cells, across which respiratory gases diffuse and equilibrate. Blood flow through the lung is unidirectional via a continuous vascular path, along which venous blood absorbs oxygen from and loses CO2 to inspired gas.

CO2, a product of active cellular metabolism, is transported from the tissues via systemic veins to the lungs, where it is expired (Fig. 24.1 ). To enhance uptake and transport of these gases between the lungs and tissues, specialized mechanisms (e.g., binding of O2 and hemoglobin and HCO3 \u2212 transport of CO2) have evolved that enable O2 uptake and CO2 expiration to occur simultaneously.

            "content": "The lungs demonstrate anatomical and physiological unity; that is, each unit (bronchopulmonary segment) is structurally identical and functions just like every other unit. 2. The upper airways (nose, sinuses, pharynx) condition inspired air for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, and they control, via the epiglottis, the flow of air into the lungs and food/fluids into the esophagus. 3. Components of the lower airways (trachea, bronchi, bronchioles) are considered conducting airways in which air is transported to the gas-exchanging respiratory units composed of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli. 4."

Bethesda, MD: American Physiological Society; 1986. 7. There are four categories of hypoxia (hypoxic hypoxia, anemic hypoxia, diffusion hypoxia, and histotoxic hypoxia) and six mechanisms of hypoxic hypoxia and hypoxemia: anatomical shunt, physiological shunt, decreased FiO2, V\u0307 /Q\u0307 mismatching, diffusion abnormalities, and hypoventilation. 8. There are two mechanisms of the development of hypercapnia: increase in dead space ventilation and hypoventilation. Wasserman K, Beaver WL, Whipp BI.

            "content": "R is usually around 0.85, and more oxygen is absorbed than CO2 is excreted. Together, these phenomena allow the estimation of alveolar oxygen tension, according to the following relationship, known as the alveolar gas equation: The alveolar gas equation also highlights the influences of inspired oxygen fraction (Fi ), barometric pressure (P ), and vapor pressure of water (PH2O = 47 mmHg at 37\u00b0C) in addition to alveolar ventilation (which sets Pa ) in determining Pa . An implication of the alveolar gas equation is that severe arterial hypoxemia rarely occurs as a pure consequence of alveolar hypoventilation at sea level while an individual is breathing air. The potential for alveolar hypoventilation to induce severe hypoxemia with otherwise normal lungs increases as falls with increasing altitude."
