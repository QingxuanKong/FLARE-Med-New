    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the characteristics of a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy and the conditions that represent a neurosurgical emergency. The IIIrd cranial nerve, also known as the oculomotor nerve, controls several important eye movements and pupil constriction. A palsy of this nerve can cause ptosis, mydriasis (dilated pupil), and other eye movement abnormalities. According to Document [1] (Title: Anatomy_Gray), the oculomotor nerve pierces the dura mater to run in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus and leaves the cranial cavity through the superior orbital fissure. In the case of a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy, the affected eye deviates down and out (infraducted, abducted), with associated ptosis and a dilated, mydriatic pupil. This is described in Document [1] (Title: Anatomy_Gray) as a unilateral third nerve palsy with a dilated pupil. In Document [1] (Title: Anatomy_Gray), it is stated that the pupil is dilated, which is a key characteristic of IIIrd cranial nerve palsy. In Document [1] (Title: Anatomy_Gray), the correct answer is stated as a dilated pupil. However, in Document [1] (Title: Anatomy_Gray) it is stated that the pupil is dilated and mydriatic, which means that it is fixed and dilated, not constricted. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Unilateral fixed dilated pupil.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

With unilateral third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy, the involved eye deviates down and out (infraducted, abducted), with associated ptosis and a dilated, mydriatic pupil. Injury to cranial nerve IV (trochlear nerve) causes weakness of downward eye movement with consequent vertical diplopia. Cranial nerve VI (abducens nerve) palsy results in the inability to move the eye outward. Because cranial nerve VI has a long intracranial route within the sub-arachnoid space, failure of abduction of one or both eyes is a frequent, but nonspecific, sign of increased ICP."

A 33-year-old fit and well woman came to the emergency department complaining of double vision and pain behind her right eye. She had no other symptoms. On examination of the right eye the pupil was dilated. There was a mild ptosis. Testing of eye movement revealed that the eye turned down and out and the pupillary reflex was not present. These findings revealed that the patient had an ipsilateral third nerve palsy (palsy of the oculomotor nerve [III]). The oculomotor nerve [III] is the main motor nerve to the ocular and extra-ocular muscles. It arises from the midbrain and pierces the dura mater to run in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. The oculomotor nerve [III] leaves the cranial cavity and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. Within this fissure it divides into its superior and inferior divisions."

In this situation, the main clinical problem is to determine whether the lesion lies within the brainstem or outside it. Lesions that lie on the surface of the brainstem are characterized by involvement of adjacent cranial nerves (often occurring in succession) and late and rather slight involvement of the long sensory and motor pathways and segmental structures lying within the brainstem. The opposite is true of primary lesions within the brainstem. The extramedullary lesion is more likely to cause bone erosion or enlargement of the foramens of exit of cranial nerves. The intramedullary lesion involving cranial nerves often produces a crossed sensory or motor paralysis (cranial nerve signs on one side of the body and tract signs on the opposite side)."

If the lesion is extramedullary, the glossopharyngeal and spinal accessory nerves are frequently involved (jugular foramen syndrome). If it is extracranial in the posterior laterocondylar or retroparotid space, there may be a combination of ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth cranial nerve palsies and a Horner\u2019s syndrome (Table 455-2). If there is no sensory loss over the palate and pharynx and no palatal weakness or dysphagia, the lesion is below the origin of the pharyngeal branches, which leave the vagus nerve high in the cervical region; the usual site of disease is then the mediastinum."

Disruption of the ossicular chain can cause hearing loss and may necessitate surgery. Vestibular disturbances, producing prolonged posttraumatic vertigo, are extremely common. Permanent loss of olfaction after a head injury is the result of a rupture of the thin olfactory nerves within the cribriform plate.

Surgical anastomosis has sometimes been successful in restoring function in this circumstance. The second, more common type, is associated with longitudinal fractures of the petrous bone, the facial palsy then often being delayed for several days, a sequence that may be misinterpreted as progression of the intracranial traumatic lesion.

Unlike all other cranial nerves, the fourth nerve emerges from the dorsal surface of the lower midbrain and then decussates a short distance from its origin, just caudal to the inferior colliculi. The nerves proceed circumferentially and ventrally around the midbrain toward the entry of the nerve into the posterior cavernous sinus. Each nucleus therefore innervates the contralateral superior oblique muscle. The long extraaxial course and the position of the nerves adjacent to the brainstem is a putative explanation for the common complication of fourth-nerve palsy in head injury (see Chap. 34). The superior oblique muscle forms a tendon that passes through a pulley structure (the trochlea) and attaches to the upper aspect of the globe. When the eye is adducted, the muscle exerts an upward pull, but being attached to the globe behind the axis of rotation, it"

A successive involvement of all cranial nerves on one side has been referred to as Garcin syndrome, or hemibasal syndrome. It has been reported in chondromas and chondrosarcomas of the clivus, but may occur with nasopharyngeal carcinomas. Bone erosion is likely to be seen radiographically in these cases. Table 44-2 lists the main causes of multiple cranial nerve palsies of extramedullary origin in our experience."

While decom-pression of subdural hematomas may be delayed, epidural hematomas require evacuation within 70 minutes.83 The final stages of this sequence are caused by blood accumulation that forces the temporal lobe medially, with resultant compression of the third cranial nerve and eventually the brain stem. The burr hole is made on the side of the dilated pupil to decompress the intracranial space. After stabilization, the patient is transferred to a facility with neurosurgical capability for formal craniotomy.In addition to operative intervention, postinjury care directed at limiting secondary injury to the brain is critical. The goal of resuscitation and management in patients with head"

            "content": "The third nerve is commonly compressed by aneurysm, tumor, or temporal lobe herniation. In a series of 206 cases of third-nerve palsy collected by Wray and Taylor, neoplastic diseases accounted for 25 percent and aneurysms for 18 percent. Of the neoplasms, 25 percent were parasellar meningiomas and 4 percent were pituitary adenomas. The palsy is usually chronic, progressive, and painless. As emphasized earlier, enlargement of the pupil is a sign of extramedullary third nerve compression because of the peripheral location in the nerve of the pupilloconstrictor fibers. By contrast, infarction of the nerve in diabetics usually spares the pupil, as the damage is situated in the central portion of the nerve. The oculomotor palsy that complicates diabetes (the cause in 11 percent in the Wray and Taylor series) develops over a few hours and is accompanied by pain, which may be severe, in the forehead and around the eye. The prognosis for recovery (as in other nonprogressive lesions of the"

Printed discharge instructions, which describe moni-toring for confusion, persistent nausea, weakness, or speech difficulty, should be provided to the caretaker. The patient should return to the emergency department for evaluation of such symptoms.Patients with a history of altered consciousness, amne-sia, progressive headache, skull or facial fracture, vomiting, or seizure have a moderate risk for intracranial injury and should undergo a prompt head CT. If the CT is normal, and the neuro-logic examination has returned to baseline (excluding amnesia of the event), then the patient can be discharged to the care of a responsible adult, again with printed criteria for returning to the emergency room. Otherwise the patient must be admitted for a 24-hour observation"

            "content": "Astrocytomas of the brainstem are relatively slow-growing tumors that infiltrate tracts and nuclei. They produce a variable clinical picture depending on their location in the medulla, pons, or midbrain. Most often, this tumor begins in childhood (peak age of onset is 7 years), and 80 percent appear before the 21st year. Symptoms have usually been present for 3 to 5 months before coming to medical notice. In most patients the initial manifestation is a palsy of one or more cranial nerves, usually the sixth and seventh on one side, followed by long tract signs\u2014hemiparesis, unilateral ataxia, ataxia of gait, paraparesis, and hemisensory and gaze disorders in addition to pseudobulbar dysarthria and palsy. In the remaining patients the symptoms occur in the reverse order\u2014that is, long tract signs precede the cranial nerve abnormalities. Patients in the latter group survive longer than those whose illness begins with cranial nerve palsies. Headache, vomiting, and papilledema may occur,"
