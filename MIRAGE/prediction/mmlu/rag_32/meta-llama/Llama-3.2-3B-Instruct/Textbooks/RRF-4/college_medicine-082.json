The defect in learning can be remarkably severe. The patient may be incapable, for example, of committing to memory the simplest of facts (such as the examiner\u2019s name, the date, and the time of day) despite countless attempts; the patient can repeat each fact as it is presented, indicating that he understands what is wanted of him and that \u201cregistration\u201d is intact, but by the time the third fact is repeated, the first may have been forgotten. However, certain nonverbal learning may take place; for example, with repeated trials, the patient may learn complex tasks such as mirror writing or how to negotiate a maze, despite no recollection of ever having been confronted with these tasks."

Random assignment helps ensure that the two groups are truly comparable. The control group may be treated with a placebo or with the accepted standard of care. The study may be masked in one of two ways: single-masked, in which patients do not know which treatment group they are in, or double-masked, in which neither the patients nor their physicians know who is in which group. Double-masked studies are the gold standard for studying treatment effects. Advantages of randomized controlled trials are as follows: They involve minimal bias. They have the potential to demonstrate causal relationships. Disadvantages include the following: They are costly and time intensive. Informed consent may be diffcult to obtain. Some interventions (e.g., surgery) are not amenable to masking. Ethical standards cannot allow all variables to be controlled."

The authors tend to agree with those who view intelligence as a general mental capability, embracing a number of primary abilities: the capacity to comprehend complex ideas, learn from experience, think abstractly, reason, plan, draw analogies, and solve problems. Thus intelligence includes a multiplicity of abilities, which probably accounts for a lack of consensus about its mechanism. Everyday experience teaches us that it is not always abstract tasks that suffer most when intelligence is impaired. Indeed, even abstraction is not likely to be a unitary function. Theoreticians, like Carl Spearman, believed that intelligence comprises a general (g), or core, factor and a series of special (s) factors. In contrast, Thurstone conceived of intelligence as a mosaic of factors such as drive and curiosity, verbal and arithmetic ability, memory,"

Another noteworthy fact is that long-standing social habits, automatic motor skills, and memory for words (language) and visual impressions (visual or pictorial attributes of persons, objects, and places) are unimpaired. Long periods of repetition and usage may have made these implicit or procedural memories virtually automatic; they no longer require the participation of the diencephalic\u2013hippocampal structures that were necessary to learn them originally.

Finally, the learning difficulty may be restricted to one academic skill or domain (e.g., read- ing single words, retrieving or calculating number facts)."
