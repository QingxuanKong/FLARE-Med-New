    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the properties of killed and live vaccines in relation to the newly discovered severe respiratory illness caused by a newly identified virus. Killed vaccines are generally preferred for certain types of infections, such as bacterial infections, where the concern is the potential for reversion to virulence. This is because live vaccines can potentially introduce new strains of the virus into the population, which could lead to the emergence of more virulent strains. In the case of a newly identified virus, the primary concern is the potential for reversion to virulence, as the virus may not have been previously studied or characterized. Therefore, a killed vaccine would be a safer choice to avoid the risk of reversion to virulence. Additionally, killed vaccines can provide long-lasting immunity, which is often required for bacterial infections. However, the question is asking for the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine, so we need to evaluate the options. Option A, 'Avoids the concern for reversion to virulence', is the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for this illness. Options B, C, and D are not as relevant to the primary concern of reversion to virulence in a newly identified virus. \", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

            "content": "Such an approach might be useful in developing live influenza vaccines. As described in Chapter 13, the influenza virus can reinfect the same host several times, because it undergoes antigenic shift and thus predominantly escapes the original immune response. A weak protection conferred by previous infections with a different subtype of influenza is observed in adults, but not in children, and is called heterosubtypic immunity. The current approach to vaccination against influenza is to use a killed virus vaccine that is reformulated annually on the basis of the prevalent strains of virus. The vaccine is moderately effective, reducing mortality in elderly people and illness in healthy adults. The ideal influenza vaccine would be an attenuated live organism that matched the prevalent virus strain. This could be created by first introducing a series of attenuating mutations into the gene encoding a viral polymerase protein, PB2. The mutated gene segment from the attenuated virus could"

Examples include respiratory microorganisms such as B. pertussis, rhinoviruses, and influenza viruses, and enteric microorganisms such as Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhi, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, and Shigella. Intranasally administered live-attenuated vaccine against influenza virus induces mucosal antibodies, which are more effective than systemic antibodies in the control of upper respiratory tract infection. However, the systemic antibodies induced by injection are effective in controlling lower respiratory tract disease, which is responsible for the severe morbidity and mortality due to this disease. Thus, a realistic goal of any pandemic influenza vaccine is to prevent the lower respiratory tract disease but accept the fact that mild illness will not be prevented."

A hospitalized child with chickenpox should be isolated in a negative-pressure room to prevent transmission. A live attenuated varicella vaccine\u2014two doses for all children\u2014is recommended. The first dose should be administered at age 12 to 15 months and the second dose at 4 to 6 years. Varicella vaccine is 85% effective in preventing any disease and 97% effective in preventing moderately severe and severe disease. Transmission of vaccine virus from a healthy vaccinated individual is rare but possible. Passive immunity can be provided by VZIG, which is indicated within 96 hours of exposure for susceptible individuals at increased risk for severe illness. Administration of VZIG does not eliminate the possibility of disease in recipients and prolongs the incubation period up to 28 days. Available @ StudentConsult.com"

In general, these patients should receive any killed or inactivated vaccine preparation appropriate to the area they are visiting; this recommendation includes the vaccines for Japanese encephalitis, hepatitis A and B, poliomyelitis, meningococcal infection, and typhoid. The live typhoid vaccines are not recommended for use in most immunocompromised patients, but an inactivated or purified polysaccharide typhoid vaccine can be used. Live yellow fever vaccine should not be administered. On the other hand, primary immunization or boosting with the purified-protein hepatitis B vaccine is indicated. Inactivated hepatitis A vaccine should also be used in the appropriate setting (Chap. 148). A vaccine is now available that provides dual protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis"
