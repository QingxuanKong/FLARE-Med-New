The general transcription factors TBP and TFIIB are specific to Eukarya and play a crucial role in the initiation of transcription. In contrast, Bacteria use different general transcription factors.

In contrast to bacteria, which contain a single type of RNA polymerase, eukaryotic nuclei have three: RNA polymerase I, RNA polymerase II, and RNA polymerase III. The three polymerases are structurally similar to one another and share some common subunits, but they transcribe different categories of genes (Table 6\u20132). RNA polymerases I and III transcribe the genes encoding transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and various small RNAs. RNA polymerase II transcribes most genes, including all those that encode proteins, and our subsequent discussion therefore focuses on this enzyme. Eukaryotic RNA polymerase II has many structural similarities to bacterial RNA polymerase (Figure 6\u201314). But there are several important differences in the way in which the bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes function, two of which concern us immediately. 1."

Thus, out of 4873 protein-coding gene families defined by comparing the genomes of 50 species of bacteria, 13 archaea, and 3 unicellular eukaryotes, only 63 are truly ubiquitous (that is, represented in all the genomes analyzed). The great majority of these universal families include components of the translation and transcription systems. This is not likely to be a realistic approximation of an ancestral gene set. A better\u2014though still crude\u2014idea of the latter can be obtained by tallying the gene families that have representatives in multiple, but not necessarily all, species from all three major domains.

The gene widely used to identify microbes and their evolutionary relationships encodes the major RNA component of the small subunit (SSU) of ribosomes.

The initial studies that led to the classification of the living world into the three domains of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes were based chiefly on analysis of one of the rRNA components of the ribosome. Because the translation of RNA into protein is fundamental to all living cells, this component of the ribosome has been very well conserved since early in the history of life on Earth (Figure 1\u201318). Natural selection has generally favored those prokaryotic cells that can reproduce the fastest by taking up raw materials from their environment and replicating themselves most efficiently, at the maximal rate permitted by the available food supplies. Small size implies a large ratio of surface area to volume, thereby helping to maximize the uptake of nutrients across the plasma membrane and boosting a cell\u2019s reproductive rate."

In this way we can begin to take stock of the common inheritance of all living things. There are considerable difficulties in this enterprise. For example, individual species have often lost some of the ancestral genes; other genes have almost certainly been acquired by horizontal transfer from another species and therefore are not truly ancestral, even though shared. In fact, genome comparisons strongly suggest that both lineage-specific gene loss and horizontal gene transfer, in some cases between evolutionarily distant species, have been major factors of evolution, at least among prokaryotes. Finally, in the course of 2 or 3 billion years, some genes that were initially shared will have changed beyond recognition through mutation."

Once bound to DNA, positive transcription regulators (activators) help RNA polymerase begin transcribing genes, and negative regulators (repressors) block this from happening. In bacteria, as we have seen, most of the interactions between DNA-bound transcription regulators and RNA polymerases (whether they activate or repress transcription) are direct. In contrast, these interactions are almost always indirect in eukaryotes: many intermediate proteins, including the his-tones, act between the DNA-bound transcription regulator and RNA polymerase.

Perhaps the most important concept, one that applies to all species on Earth, is based on a group of proteins known as transcription regulators. These proteins recognize specific sequences of DNA (typically 5\u201310 nucleotide pairs in length) that are often called cis-regulatory sequences, because they must be on the same chromosome (that is, in cis) to the genes they control. Transcription regulators bind to these sequences, which are dispersed throughout genomes, and this binding puts into motion a series of reactions that ultimately specify which genes are to be transcribed and at what rate. Approximately 10% of the protein-coding genes of most organisms are devoted to transcription regulators, making them one of the largest classes of proteins in the cell. In most cases, a given transcription regulator recognizes its own cis-regulatory sequence, which is different from those recognized by all the other"

            "content": "Presumably for these reasons, most prokaryotic cells carry very little superfluous baggage; their genomes are small, with genes packed closely together and minimal quantities of regulatory DNA between them. The small genome size has made it easy to use modern DNA sequencing techniques to determine complete genome sequences. We now have this information for thousands of species of bacteria and archaea, as well as for hundreds of species of eukaryotes. Most bacterial and archaeal genomes contain between 106 and 107 nucleotide pairs, encoding 1000\u20136000 genes."

The TBP is the subunit of the general transcription factor TFIID that is responsible for recognizing and binding to the TATA box sequence in the DNA (red). The unique DNA bending caused by TBP\u2014kinks in the double helix separated by partly unwound DNA\u2014is thought to serve as a landmark that helps to attract the other general transcription factors (Movie 6.4). TBP is a single polypeptide chain that is folded into two very similar domains (blue and green). (Adapted from J.L. Kim et al., Nature 365:520\u2013527, 1993.

            "content": "Natural selection has evidently favored mitochondria with small genomes. By contrast, the nuclear genomes of most eukaryotes seem to have been free to enlarge. Perhaps the eukaryotic way of life has made large size an advantage: predators typically need to be bigger than their prey, and cell size generally increases in proportion to genome size. Whatever the reason, aided by a massive accumulation of DNA segments derived from parasitic transposable elements (discussed in Chapter 5), the genomes of most eukaryotes have become orders of magnitude larger than those of bacteria and archaea (Figure 1\u201332). The freedom to be extravagant with DNA has had profound implications. Eukaryotes not only have more genes than prokaryotes; they also have vastly more DNA that does not code for protein. The human genome contains 1000 times as many nucleotide pairs as the genome of a typical bacterium, perhaps 10 times as Figure 1\u201331 The origin of chloroplasts."

The situation in bacteria is simpler than in eukaryotes (for one thing, chromatin structure is not an issue), and we therefore discuss it first. Following this, we turn to the more complex situation in eukaryotes. the tryptophan repressor Switches Genes Off"
