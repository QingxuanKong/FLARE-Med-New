The Gram stain of the exudate shows numerous neutrophils with intracellular gram-negative diplococci. The patient has had three similar episodes of urethritis over the past 2 years. We need to determine which property of the infecting organism best explains the reinfection.\\n\\nThe key information here is the presence of intracellular gram-negative diplococci in the Gram stain, which is consistent with Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. The patient's history of recurrent urethritis also suggests a chronic or persistent infection.\\n\\nOption A, Antigenic variation, is a property of some bacteria that allows them to change their surface antigens, making it harder for the host's immune system to recognize and fight them. This could contribute to reinfection, as the immune system may not be able to recognize the new strain.\\n\\nOption B, Catalase, is an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide and is not directly related to the ability of the bacterium to cause reinfection.\\n\\nOption C, Inhibition of B-lymphocyte function, refers to the suppression of B cells, which are a type of immune cell involved in the adaptive immune response. While this could contribute to reinfection, it is not the most likely explanation in this case.\\n\\nOption D, Inhibition of T-lymphocyte function, also refers to the suppression of T cells, which are another type of immune cell involved in the adaptive immune response. Again, this is not the most likely explanation for the patient's reinfection.\\n\\nBased on the information provided, the most likely explanation for the patient's reinfection is antigenic variation, as it would allow the Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacterium to evade the host's immune system and cause repeated infections.\\n\\nAnswer: A\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Clustering may be related temporally to the presence of a new risk factor or to the sloughing of the protective outer bladder epithelial layer in response to bacterial attachment during acute cystitis. The likelihood of a recurrence decreases with increasing time since the last infection. A case-control study of predominantly white premenopausal women with recurrent UTI identified frequent sexual intercourse, use of spermicide, a new sexual partner, a first UTI before 15 years of age, and a"

            "content": "NGU is the initial manifestation of reactive arthritis in 80% of patients, typically occurring within 14 days after sexual exposure. The urethritis may be mild and may even go unnoticed by the patient. Similarly, gonococcal urethritis may precede reactive arthritis, but co-infection with an agent of NGU is difficult to rule out. The urethral discharge may be purulent or mucopurulent, and patients may or may not report dysuria. Accompanying prostatitis, usually asymptomatic, has been described. Arthritis usually begins ~4 weeks after the onset of urethritis but may develop sooner or, in a small percentage of cases, may actually precede urethritis. The knees are most frequently involved; next most commonly affected are the ankles and small joints of the feet. Sacroiliitis, either symmetrical or asymmetrical, is documented in two-thirds of patients. Mild bilateral conjunctivitis, iritis, keratitis, or uveitis is sometimes present but lasts for only a few days. Finally, dermatologic"

Until recently, C. trachomatis caused ~30\u201340% of cases of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), particularly in heterosexual men; however, the proportion of cases due to this organism has probably declined in some populations served by effective chlamydial-control programs, and older men with urethritis appear less likely to have chlamydial infection. HSV and T. vaginalis each cause a small proportion of NGU cases in the United States. Recently, multiple studies have consistently implicated M. genitalium as a probable cause of many Framing Statement: In order to provide the best care for you today and to understand your risk for certain infections, it is necessary for us to talk about your sexual behavior.

The differential includes gonorrhea, endometriosis, PID, orchitis, vaginitis, and UTI. Lymphogranuloma venereum presents in its 1\u00b0 form as a painless, transient papule or shallow ulcer. In its 2\u00b0 form, it presents as painful swelling of the inguinal nodes, and in its 3\u00b0 form it can present as an \u201canogenital syndrome\u201d (anal pruritus with discharge, rectal strictures, rectovaginal f stula, and elephantiasis). Diagnosis is usually clinical. Culture is the gold standard. Urine tests (PCR or ligase chain reaction) are a rapid means of detection, while DNA probes and immunofuorescence (for gonorrhea/chlamydia) take 48\u201372 hours. Gram stain of urethral or genital discharge may show PMNs but no bacteria (intracellular). Chlamydia infection is a common cause of nongonococcal urethritis in men."

            "content": "Acute proctitis in persons who have practiced receptive anorectal intercourse is usually sexually acquired. Such patients should undergo anoscopy to detect rectal ulcers or vesicles and petechiae after swabbing of the rectal mucosa; to examine rectal exudates for PMNs and gram-negative diplococci; and to obtain rectal swab specimens for testing for rectal gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, herpes, and syphilis. Pending test results, patients with proctitis should receive empirical syndromic treatment\u2014e.g., with ceftriaxone (a single IM dose of 250 mg for gonorrhea) plus doxycycline (100 mg by mouth twice daily for 7 days) for possible chlamydial infection plus treatment for herpes or syphilis if indicated. If LGV proctitis is proven or suspected, the recommended treatment is doxycycline (100 mg by mouth twice daily for 21 days); alternatively, 1 g of azithromycin once a week for 3 weeks is likely to be effective but is little studied."

The cause of most of the remaining cases of NGU is uncertain, but recent evidence suggests that Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) cause some cases. The rate of involvement of C. trachomatis in urethral infection ranges from 3\u20137% among asymptomatic men to 15\u201320% among symptomatic men attending STD clinics. A multisite study of men in Baltimore, Seattle, Denver, and San Francisco reported an overall chlamydial prevalence of 7% in urine samples assessed by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). As in women, infection in men is age related, with young age as the greatest risk factor for chlamydial urethritis. The prevalence among men is highest at 20\u201324 years of age. In STD clinics, urethritis is usually less prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM) than among"
