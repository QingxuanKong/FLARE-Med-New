Flc encodes a transcriptional repressor that suppresses expression of the Ft flowering promoter. How does vernalization shut down Flc so as to lift the block to flowering? The effect involves a noncoding RNA called Coolair that overlaps with the Flc gene and is produced when the temperature is low (Figure 21\u201344). Together with cold-induced chromatin modifiers, including Polycomb-group proteins, Coolair coordinates the switching of Flc chromatin to a silent state (discussed in Chapters 4 and 7). The degree of silencing depends on the length of cold exposure enabling the plants to distinguish the odd chilly night from the whole of winter."

The \u2018relative risk\u2019 for an HLA allele in an autoimmune disease is calculated by comparing the observed number of patients carrying the HLA allele with the number that would be expected, given the prevalence of the HLA allele in the general population. For type 1 insulin\u2011dependent diabetes mellitus, the association is in fact with the HLA\u2011DQ gene, which is tightly linked to the DR genes but is not detectable by serotyping. Some diseases show a significant bias in the sex ratio; this is taken to imply that sex hormones are involved in pathogenesis. Consistent with this, the difference in the sex ratio in these diseases is greatest between menarche and menopause, when levels of such hormones are highest. Healthy controls Diabetes DR3/x (24%) DR4/x (17.5%) DR2/x (30.3%) DR3/4 (2.5%) (25.7%) DR4/x (27%) (4%) DR3/4 (39%) DR3/x (30%) DRx/x DRx/x"

Thus, while bacteria and archaea are separated by perhaps 3.5 billion years of evolution, vertebrates and insects are separated by about 700 million years, fish and mammals by about 450 million years, and the different species of flowering plants by only about 150 million years."

On his 18th birthday, he was measured at 2 feet 8.5 inches (82.6 cm) tall, and at his death, he was 3 feet 4 inches (102 cm).(Images from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ File:robert_Wadlow.jpg. \u00a9 Bettmann/cOrBIS.) or a reduced number of abnormally large cells, respectively, leaving the size (area) and patterning of the adult wing practically unchanged. Thus, the size of the disc is not regulated so as to contain a set number of cells. Instead, there must be a regulatory mechanism that halts growth when the disc\u2019s total cell mass reaches the appropriate value, so that the size and pattern of the adult wing that develops from the disc are normal.
