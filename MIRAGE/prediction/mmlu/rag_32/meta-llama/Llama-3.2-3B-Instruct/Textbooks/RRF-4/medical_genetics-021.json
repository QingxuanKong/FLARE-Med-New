    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the process of X-chromosome inactivation in female mammals. X-chromosome inactivation is a process that occurs in female mammals, where one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated in each cell. This process is crucial for dosage compensation, as females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. The inactivation process is initiated at a specific site on the X chromosome called the X-inactivation center (XIC) and spreads throughout the chromosome. The inactivated X chromosome remains inactive in all subsequent cell divisions. The process is random and occurs early in embryonic development, resulting in a mosaic of cells with either the maternal or paternal X chromosome active. This means that each cell in a female body has a mixture of cells with active and inactive X chromosomes, and the inactivated X chromosome is not present in all cells of the body. Therefore, option B is incorrect. Option C is incorrect because the Y chromosome is not inactivated in the same way as the X chromosome. Option D is also incorrect because X-chromosome inactivation occurs in mammals, including humans, not just in fruit flies. Considering these facts, the correct answer is A, which states that X-chromosome inactivation results in the genetically turning off one of the two X chromosomes in female mammals.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Indeed, phenotypically normal males with two and even three Y chromosomes have been identified. Such extreme karyotypic deviations are not encountered with the autosomes. In large part, this latitude relates to two factors: lyonization of X chromosomes and the small amount of genetic information carried by the Y chromosome. The consideration of lyonization must begin with Mary Lyon, who in 1962 proposed that in females, only one X chromosome is genetically active. X inactivation occurs early in fetal life, about 16 days after conception. Either the paternal or the maternal X chromosome is randomly inactivated in each cell of the developing embryo. Once inactivated, the same X chromosome remains inactive in all of the progeny of these cells. Moreover, all but one X chromosome is inactivated, and so a 48,XXXX female has only one active X chromosome. This phenomenon"

In a given cell, the choice of which chromosome is inactivated occurs randomly in humans. But once the maternal or paternal X chromosome is inactivated, it will remain inactive, and this information is transmitted with each cell division. The X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) gene encodes a large noncoding RNA that mediates the silencing of the X chromosome from which it is transcribed by coating it with Xist RNA. The inactive X chromosome is highly methylated and has low levels of histone acetylation."

According to the model depicted here, the long (\u224820,000 nucleotides) Xist rnA has many low-affinity binding sites for the structural components of chromosomes and spreads by releasing its hold on one portion of the chromosome while grasping another. the continued synthesis of Xist from the center of the chromosome drives it to the ends. As shown, Xist rnA does not move linearly along the chromosomal DnA, but, instead, moves first across the base of chromosome loops. it has been proposed that the portions of chromosomal DnA at the tips of long loops contain the 10% of genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation."

The molecular basis of X inactivation involves a long non\u2013coding RNA that is encoded by the XIST gene. This non\u2013coding RNA is retained in the nucleus, where it \u201ccoats\u201d the X chromosome that it is transcribed from and silences the genes on that chromosome.

Most important, the initial presumption that all of the genes on the inactive X are \u201cswitched off\u201d has been revised, as roughly 21% of genes on Xp, and a smaller number (3%) on Xq, escape X inactivation. This observation has implications for monosomic X chromosome disorders, or Turner syndrome, as discussed later. Extra Y chromosomes are readily tolerated because the only information known to be carried on the Y chromosome seems to relate to male differentiation. Of note, whatever the number of X chromosomes, the presence of a Y invariably dictates the male phenotype. The gene for male differentiation (SRY, sex-determining region of Y chromosome) is located on the short arm of the Y. Described briefly next are two disorders, Klinefelter syndrome and Turner syndrome, that result from aberrations of sex chromosomes."

There are, however, important exceptions to this rule. X-inactivation prevents the expression of most genes on one of the two X chromosomes in every cell of a female. Gene inactivation through genomic imprinting occurs on selected chromosomal regions of autosomes and leads to inheritable preferential expression of one of the parental alleles. It is of pathophysiologic importance in disorders where the transmission of disease is dependent on the sex of the transmitting parent and, thus, plays an important role in the expression of certain genetic disorders. Two classic examples are the Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman\u2019s syndrome (Chap. 83e). Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by diminished fetal activity, obesity, hypotonia, mental retardation, short stature, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism."

Xist RNA spreads from the XIC over the entire chromosome and directs gene silencing. Although we do not know exactly how this is accomplished, it likely involves recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes and other proteins to form a repressive form of chromatin analogous to that of Figure 7\u201345.

An obvious possibility is that the stability of the pattern of gene expression in an adult cell may depend, in part at least, on self-perpetuating modifications of chromatin, as discussed in Chapter 4. As explained in Chapter 7, the phenomenon of X-inactivation in mammals provides a clear example of such epigenetic control. Two X chromosomes exist side by side in each female cell, exposed to the same chemical environment, but while one remains active, the other persists from one cell generation to the next in a condensed inactive state; cytoplasmic factors cannot be responsible for the difference, which must instead reflect mechanisms intrinsic to the individual chromosome. Elsewhere in the genome also, controls at the level of chromatin act in combination with other forms of regulation to govern the expression of each gene."

Similarly, hemizygous-deficient males (with a deficient copy of the G6PD gene on their single X chromosome) and homozygous-deficient females (with two deficient copies) express reduced activity phenotypes (Table 5\u20131). However, for heterozygous females (with one deficient allele and one normal allele), genotype-to-phenotype predictions are less reliable due to the X-chromosome mosaicism, ie, where one X chromosome in each female cell is randomly inactivated, leading to G6PD activity that"

            "content": "Eukaryotic cells can use inherited forms of DNA methylation and inherited states of chromatin condensation as additional mechanisms for generating cell memory of gene expression patterns. An especially dramatic case that involves chromatin condensation is the inactivation of an entire X chromosome in female mammals. DNA methylation underlies the phenomenon in mammals of genomic imprinting, in which the expression of a gene depends on whether it was inherited from the mother or the father."

            "content": "In chromosome breakage-and-rejoining events of the sort just described, the zone of silencing, where euchromatin is converted to a heterochromatic state, spreads for different distances in different early cells in the fly embryo. Remarkably, these differences then are perpetuated for the rest of the animal\u2019s life: in each cell, once the heterochromatic condition is established on a piece of chromatin, it tends to be stably inherited by all of that cell\u2019s progeny (Figure 4\u201331). This remarkable phenomenon, called position effect variegation, was first recognized through a detailed genetic analysis of the mottled loss of red pigment in the fly eye (Figure 4\u201332). It shares features with the extensive spread of heterochromatin that inactivates one of the two X chromosomes in female mammals. There too, a random process acts in each cell of the early embryo to dictate which X chromosome will be inactivated, and that same X chromosome then remains inactive in all the cell\u2019s progeny, creating"

            "content": "cHromosomes The human genome is divided into 23 different chromosomes, including 22 autosomes (numbered 1\u201322) and the X and Y sex chromosomes (Fig. 82-1). Adult cells are diploid, meaning they contain two homologous sets of 22 autosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), whereas males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). As a consequence of meiosis, germ cells (sperm or oocytes) are haploid and contain one set of 22 autosomes and one of the sex chromosomes. At the time of fertilization, the diploid genome is reconstituted by pairing of the homologous chromosomes from the mother and father. With each cell division (mitosis), chromosomes are replicated, paired, segregated, and divided into two daughter cells."
