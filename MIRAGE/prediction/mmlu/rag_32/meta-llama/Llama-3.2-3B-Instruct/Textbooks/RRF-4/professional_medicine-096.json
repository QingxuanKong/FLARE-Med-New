    "question": "A 9-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive weakness and a purple-red discoloration over his cheeks and upper eyelids over the past 8 weeks. His symptoms began shortly after a camping trip, and he now is unable to climb stairs, walk long distances, comb his hair, or dress himself. His mother says that she was careful to apply his sunscreen on the trip and can recall no tick bites or exposure to poisonous plants. His only medication is a topical corticosteroid for several dry, scaly patches of the skin. He appears weak and lethargic. He is at the 75th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight; he has had no change in his weight since his last examination 9 months ago. His temperature is 37.7\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 28/min. Examination of the skin shows a purple-red discoloration over the cheeks and eyelids, periorbital edema, erythematous plaques and scales over the elbows and knees, and flat-topped red papules over all knuckles. There is generalized weakness and atrophy of the proximal muscles. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The symptoms began after a camping trip, and the patient has a history of dry, scaly skin patches treated with a topical corticosteroid. The skin changes precede the muscle syndrome, which is a characteristic feature of dermatomyositis. The presence of Gottron papules (flat-topped red papules over the knuckles) and the absence of tick bites or exposure to poisonous plants make Lyme disease less likely. The patient's muscle weakness and atrophy of the proximal muscles are consistent with dermatomyositis. The patient's age and sex are also consistent with dermatomyositis, which is more common in children and young adults. Eczema and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy are less likely given the patient's symptoms and history. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is dermatomyositis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Most often, the skin changes precede the muscle syndrome and take the form of a localized or diffuse erythema, maculopapular eruption, scaling eczematoid dermatitis, or exfoliative dermatitis. Sometimes, skin and muscle changes evolve together over a period of 3 weeks or less. A characteristic form of the skin lesions are patches of a scaly roughness over the extensor surfaces of joints (elbows, knuckles, and knees) with varying degrees of pink-purple coloration. Red, raised papules may be present over exposed surfaces such as the elbows, knuckles, and distal and proximal interphalangeal joints (Gottron papules\u2014applied in some writings to all the skin changes over the knuckles and extensor prominences); these are particularly prominent in DM of childhood.

On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8\u00b0F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed the following: alanine aminotransferase, 527 IU/L (normal 10\u201335 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 425 IU/L (normal < 35 IU/L); and bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL (normal 0.1\u20130.3 mg/dL).

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

Review of the past history and growth chart demonstrates normal birth weight and birth length, but a progressive decrease in height per-centiles relative to age-matched normal ranges starting at 6 months of age, and orthostasis with febrile illnesses. Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD. Laboratory evaluations demonstrate growth hormone (GH) deficiency and a delayed bone age of 18 months. The patient is started on replacement with recombinant human GH at a dose of 40 mcg/kg per day subcutaneously. After 1 year of treatment, his height velocity has increased from 5 cm/y to 11 cm/y.

Several of LT\u2019s teeth were loose, including one that anchors his dental bridge. Several black and blue marks (ecchymoses) were noted on the legs, and an unhealed sore was present on the right wrist. Inspection of his scalp revealed tiny red spots (petechiae) around some of the hair follicles. Blood was drawn for testing. Results of tests on LT\u2019s blood: The test for blood in his stool (occult blood test) was negative. Results of follow-up tests (obtained several days after the appointment) included the following: H = High; L = Low. Diagnosis: LT has vitamin C deficiency with a microcytic, hypochromic anemia secondary to the deficiency. Treatment: LT was prescribed vitamin C (as oral ascorbic acid) and iron (as oral ferrous sulfate) supplements. He will also be referred to social services. Prognosis: The prognosis for recovery is excellent."

A localized or grouped eruption may suggest a cutaneous infection, whereas widespread, symmetrical involvement of extensor surfaces may suggest a primary skin disorder, such as psoriasis. Herpesvirus lesions are usually grouped lesions. Annular lesions may suggest Lyme disease, syphilis, and fungal infections. Lesions on mucous membranes are usually short-lived, and lesions in thick-skinned areas, such as the palms and soles, may be particularly difficult to characterize. A thorough history and physical examination are usuallysufficient for diagnosis because of the visibility of the skin.Adjunctive tests at the time of examination include potassiumhydroxide (KOH) examination for fungi and dermatophytes,skin scrapings for scabies, cytologic examination (Tzancktest) for herpesvirus and varicella-zoster virus infection, andWood light examination for the yellowish gold fluorescence"

Burrows appear as dark wavy lines in the upper epidermis and are 3\u201315 mm long. Scabetic lesions are most common on the volar wrists and along the digital web spaces. In males, the penis and scrotum become involved. Small papules and vesicles, often accompanied by eczematous plaques, pustules, or nodules, appear symmetrically at those sites; within intertriginous areas; around the navel and belt line; in the axillae; and on the buttocks and upper thighs. Except in infants, the face, scalp, neck, palms, and soles are usually spared. Crusted scabies often resembles psoriasis: both are characterized by widespread thick keratotic crusts, scaly plaques, and dystrophic nails. Characteristic burrows are not seen in crusted scabies, and patients usually do not itch, although their infestations are highly contagious and"
