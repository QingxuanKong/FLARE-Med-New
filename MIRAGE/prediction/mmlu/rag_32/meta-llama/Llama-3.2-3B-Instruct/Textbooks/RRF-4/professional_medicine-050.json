    "question": "A 47-year-old man is admitted to the hospital through the emergency department because of the sudden onset of palpitations, left-sided chest pain, light-headedness, and shortness of breath that began while he was watching television 2 hours ago. Medical history is remarkable for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 82 kg (180 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . ECG obtained in the emergency department showed atrial fibrillation with narrow QRS complex. Pulse was 146/min. Physical examination was remarkable for rapid heart rate. The patient was given oxygen via nasal cannula and intravenous metoprolol 5 mg every 5 minutes for a total of 15 mg. His pulse slowed to 90/min. Two hours after admission, he is pain free but his pulse is now 160/min. Blood pressure is 122/78 mm Hg. In order to decrease the patient's pulse, which of the following should be administered intravenously?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thought process: **Step 1: Understand the patient's condition** The patient is experiencing palpitations, left-sided chest pain, light-headedness, and shortness of breath, which began suddenly 2 hours ago. The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The ECG shows atrial fibrillation with a narrow QRS complex, indicating that the ventricles are contracting normally. **Step 2: Identify the goal** The goal is to decrease the patient's pulse rate, which is currently 160/min. **Step 3: Consider the patient's medication history** The patient has already been given intravenous metoprolol, which is a beta-blocker. However, the patient's pulse rate has increased to 160/min despite this treatment. **Step 4: Evaluate the options** Option A, Digoxin, is a digitalis glycoside that can be used to control ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation, but it is not typically used as a first-line agent to decrease a rapid ventricular rate. Option B, Enalapril, is an ACE inhibitor that can be used to treat hypertension and heart failure, but it is not typically used to decrease a rapid ventricular rate. Option C, Lidocaine, is a class Ib antiarrhythmic agent that can be used to treat ventricular arrhythmias, but it is not typically used to decrease a rapid ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation. Option D, Metoprolol, is the same medication that was already given to the patient, but in a higher dose. **Step 5: Choose the best option** Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the need to decrease the ventricular rate, the best option is to administer a medication that can be used to control the ventricular rate without causing significant hypotension. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can be used to decrease the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation, and it is already being used in the patient. Therefore, the best option is to increase the dose of metoprolol. Here is the output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is experiencing a rapid ventricular rate. The patient has already been given intravenous metoprolol, but the rate is still elevated. The goal is to decrease the patient's pulse rate. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can be used to control the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation. Therefore, the best option is to increase the dose of metoprolol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

            "content": "The patient has a low ejection fraction with systolic heart failure, probably secondary to hypertension. His heart fail-ure must be treated first, followed by careful control of the hypertension. He was initially treated with a diuretic (furo-semide, 40 mg twice daily). On this therapy, he was less short of breath on exertion and could also lie flat without dyspnea. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhib-itor was added (enalapril, 20 mg twice daily), and over the next few weeks, he continued to feel better. Because of continued shortness of breath on exercise, digoxin at 0.25 mg/d was added with a further modest improvement in exercise tolerance. The blood pressure stabilized at 150/90 mm Hg, and the patient will be educated regarding the relation between his hypertension and heart failure and the need for better blood pressure control. Cautious addition of a \u03b2 blocker (metoprolol) will be considered. Blood lipids, which are currently in the normal range, will be monitored."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

            "content": "The most common cardiovascular manifestation is sinus tachycardia, often associated with palpitations, occasionally caused by supra-ventricular tachycardia. The high cardiac output produces a bounding pulse, widened pulse pressure, and an aortic systolic murmur and can lead to worsening of angina or heart failure in the elderly or those with preexisting heart disease. Atrial fibrillation is more common in patients >50 years of age. Treatment of the thyrotoxic state alone converts atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm in about half of patients, suggesting the existence of an underlying cardiac problem in the remainder."

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse.

Fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and orthopnea are the most prominent complaints in patients with chronic severe MR. Palpitations are common and may signify the onset of AF. Right-sided heart failure, with painful hepatic congestion, ankle edema, distended neck veins, ascites, and secondary TR, occurs in patients with MR who have associated pulmonary vascular disease and pulmonary hypertension. Acute pulmonary edema is common in patients with acute severe MR. In patients with chronic severe MR, the arterial pressure is usually normal, although the carotid arterial pulse may show a sharp, low-volume upstroke owing to the reduced forward CO. A systolic thrill is often palpable at the cardiac apex, the LV is hyperdynamic with a brisk systolic impulse and a palpable rapid-filling wave (S3), and the apex beat is often displaced laterally."
