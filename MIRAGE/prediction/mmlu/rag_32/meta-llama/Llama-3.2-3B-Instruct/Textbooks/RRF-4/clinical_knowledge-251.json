In this sense it is a kinetic or action tremor, but the latter term has connotations of the essential tremor to neurologists, as described earlier. The term ataxic is a suitable substitute for intention, because this tremor is always combined with cerebellar ataxia and adds to it. Its salient feature is that it requires for its full expression the performance of an exacting, precise, projected movement. The tremor is absent both when the limbs are inactive and during the first part of a voluntary movement, but as the action continues and fine adjustments of the movement are demanded (e.g., in touching the tip of the nose or the examiner\u2019s finger), an irregular interruption of forward progression appears.

Action tremors can be roughly divided into two categories: goal directed action tremor of the ataxic type related to cerebellar disorders (discussed in Chap. 5) and postural tremors, which are either the enhanced physiologic variety or essential tremor (Fig. 4-6). A postural tremor occurs with the limbs and trunk actively maintained in certain positions (such as holding the arms outstretched) and may persist throughout active movement. More particularly, the tremor is absent when the limbs are relaxed but becomes evident when the muscles are activated.

The excursion of the limb may be arrested prematurely, and the target is then reached by a series of jerky movements. In contrast, the limb may overshoot the mark (hypermetria) because of delayed activation and diminished contraction of antagonist muscles; then the error is corrected by a series of secondary movements in which the finger or toe sways around the target before coming to rest, or moves from side to side a few times on the target itself.

A conspicuous postural tremor is the cardinal feature of benign essential or familial tremor.

Alternative possibilities are that the lesion in the ventromedial tegmentum interrupts the brachium conjunctivum, a tegmental-thalamic projection, or the descending limb of the superior cerebellar peduncle, which functions as a link in a dentatoreticular-cerebellar feedback mechanism (see Fig. 5-3).

Importantly, they often diminish in amplitude or disappear if the patient is distracted as, for example, when asked to make a complex movement with the opposite hand.

Even though it is termed a \u201cresting\u201d tremor, maintaining the arm in an attitude of repose requires a certain degree of muscular contraction, albeit slight. If the tremulous hand is completely relaxed, as it is when the arm is fully supported at the wrist and elbow, the tremor usually disappears.

Cogwheeling of minor degree may be associated. The head and voice are more often truly tremulous in essential tremor than in Parkinson disease. Some of the slower, alternating forms of essential tremor are difficult to distinguish from parkinsonian tremor; one can only wait to see whether it is the first manifestation of Parkinson disease. A markedly asymmetrical or unilateral tremor favors Parkinson disease.

Electromyographically, it lacks the alternating bursts of action potentials seen in the typical tremor and resembles, if not equates with, essential tremor (see Table 4-1). It is subject to modulation by different medications than those used for the alternating Parkinson tremor. The patient may have either type of tremor or both."

            "content": "improved by alcohol and worsened by stress. Subtle impairment of coordination or tandem walking may be present, and disturbances of hearing, cognition, personality, mood, and olfaction have also been described, but usually the neurologic examination is normal aside from tremor. The major differential is a dystonic tremor (see below) or PD. PD can usually be differentiated from ET based on the presence of bradykinesia, rigidity, micrographia, and other parkinsonian features. However, the examiner should be aware that PD patients may have a postural tremor and ET patients may develop a rest tremor. These typically begin after a latency of a few seconds (emergent tremor). The examiner must take care to differentiate the effect of tremor on measurement of tone in ET from the cogwheel rigidity found in PD."

Certain abnormal tremors, namely, the metabolic varieties of postural or action tremor and at least one type of familial tremor, are considered by some to be variants or exaggerations of physiologic tremor\u2014that is, \u201cenhanced physiologic tremor,\u201d as discussed further on."
