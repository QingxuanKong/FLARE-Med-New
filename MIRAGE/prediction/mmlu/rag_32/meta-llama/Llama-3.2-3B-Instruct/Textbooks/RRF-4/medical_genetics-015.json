Step 2: Review the definition of QTL analysis QTL analysis is a technique used to identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross. This involves analyzing the relationship between genetic markers and the trait of interest. Step 3: Compare the options with the definition - Option A: \"identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross\" matches the definition of QTL analysis. - Option B: \"determine which genes are expressed at a developmental stage\" refers to gene expression analysis, not QTL analysis. - Option C: \"map genes in bacterial viruses\" is unrelated to QTL analysis. - Option D: \"identify RNA polymerase binding sites\" refers to a different biological process.

These microarrays are used to analyze a sample for the presence of gene variations or mutations (genotyping) or to determine the patterns of mRNA production (gene expression analysis), analyzing thousands of genes at the same time. For genotyping analysis, the sample is from genomic DNA. For expression analysis, the population of mRNA molecules from a particular cell type is converted to cDNA and labeled with a fluorescent tag (Fig. 34.23). This mixture is then exposed to a gene (or, DNA) chip, which is a glass slide or membrane containing thousands of tiny spots of DNA, each corresponding to a different gene. The amount of fluorescence bound to each spot is a measure of the amount of that particular mRNA in the sample.

It is well recognized clinically that affected persons often first exhibit clinical manifestations of this disease after weight gain. Thus, obesity, as well as other environmental influences, unmasks the diabetic genetic trait. Assigning a disease to this mode of inheritance must be done with caution.

            "content": "In humans, genetic susceptibility to autoimmune disorders has been recently assessed by large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs), which look for a correlation between disease frequency and genetic variants (typically single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs). Such studies typically involve thousands of patients with a given autoimmune disease diagnosis and Fig. 15.34 Manhattan plot depicting risk alleles from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of Crohn\u2019s disease. The plot highlights selected gene loci identified by analyses of single nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) with highly significant disease associations in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease compared with healthy controls (see also Section 15\u201123). The height of the peaks reflects the statistical significance of the association. The dotted line indicates the threshold for significant associations (5 \u00d7 10\u201308).

            "content": "process usually includes library construction, sequencing, and data analysis. There are three major NGS platforms: Roche 454, Life Technologies Ion Tor-rent, and Illumina Solexa. Take the Illumina next-generation sequencing as an example: DNA are shared or digested into small pieces and then used to generate a DNA library with adapt-ers on both ends of each DNA piece. Then, the DNA library is diluted and loaded on a chamber of a slide, called a lane, for cluster amplification. Cycled fluorescent deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) are then added to the chamber to enable DNA polymerization, resulting in different fluorescent emis-sion representing different dNTP reading on different clusters, into a microscope. The fluorescent signal is transformed into sequencing data that will be aligned and mapped to a standard genome database. The advantages of next-generation sequenc-ing include the following: no necessity of DNA cloning; fast and cost-effective; and a huge amount of data to"
