    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate management for the 2-year-old girl with mild bowlegs (10-degree genu varum), we need to consider the age of the child, the severity of the deformity, and the potential underlying causes. The child is 2 years old and has been weaned at 6 months and began to walk at 10 months, which suggests normal development. The mild bowlegs (10-degree genu varum) is within the range of normal variation in children around this age. According to Document [1], physiologic bowlegs are common in children older than 18 months with symmetrical genu varum, and this condition usually improves as the child approaches 2 years of age. Since the child's bowlegs are mild and symmetrical, and the child is within the normal age range, there is no indication for surgical correction or special exercise programs at this time. Therefore, the most appropriate management is to reassure the family and monitor the child's growth and development over time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

            "content": "Evaluating a child over time, coupled with a careful history and physical examination, helps determine whether the growth pattern is normal or abnormal. Parental heights may be useful when deciding whether to proceed with a further evaluation. Children, in general, follow their parents\u2019 growth pattern, although there are many exceptions. For a girl, midparental height is calculated as follows: \u22122.5 2 For a boy, midparental height is calculated as follows: +2.5 2 Actual growth depends on too many variables to makean accurate prediction from midparental height determination for every child. The growth pattern of a child with lowweight, length, and head circumference is commonly associated with familial short stature (see Chapter 173). Thesechildren are genetically normal but are smaller than most Discrepant percentiles (e.g., weight 5th, length 5th, head circumference 50th, or other discrepancies)"

Which of the eicosanoid agonists have been demonstrated to reduce both morbidity and mortality in patients with such a diagnosis? What are the modes of action? A 40-year-old woman presented to her doctor with a 6-month history of increasing shortness of breath. This was associated with poor appetite and ankle swell-ing. On physical examination, she had elevated jugular venous distention, a soft tricuspid regurgitation murmur, clear lungs, and mild peripheral edema.

The gluteus medius muscle stabilizes thepelvis during the stance phase, preventing the pelvis fromdropping toward the leg in swing phase. An antalgic gait is a painful limp; the stance phase and stride of the affected limbare shortened to decrease the discomfort of weight bearingon the affected limb. The Trendelenburg gait has a normal stance phase, but excessive swaying of the trunk. Waddling gait refers to a bilateral decrease in function of the gluteusmuscles."

Greater emphasis is placed on the late adolescent\u2019s responsibility for his or her health. A full pelvic examination is rarely required in a virginal adolescent girl. A bimanual rectal-abdominal examination (all midline internal genitalia are immediately anterior to the rectal wall) is as efficient as a vaginal-abdominal examination. In some girls, anesthesia may be required for a full pelvic examination. Before a pelvic examination, the patient should be informedabout the importance of the assessment and what maneuverswill take place; she should be encouraged to ask questionsbefore, during, or after the examination. A chaperone shouldbe offered when a family caregiver is not present. Assuringthe patient that she has complete control over the examination and allowing participating by using a mirror or guidingthe examiner is important. The examiner should maintain"
