    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the anatomy and function of the larynx, particularly the role of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) in controlling vocal fold movement. The RLN innervates all the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, except the cricothyroid muscles, which are innervated by the external laryngeal nerves. The RLN controls the adduction and abduction of the vocal folds, with the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles being the primary abductors and the lateral cricoarytenoid muscles being the primary adductors. In the case of RLN damage, the vocal fold on the injured side is typically in an intermediate position between adduction and abduction due to the loss of RLN innervation to the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, which are responsible for abduction, and the preservation of RLN innervation to the lateral cricoarytenoid muscles, which are responsible for adduction. This results in a tense vocal fold that is not fully abducted but not fully adducted either. The cricothyroid muscle, which is responsible for adjusting tension in the vocal folds, is not directly affected by RLN damage, so it remains functional. Therefore, the correct answer is related to the function of the interarytenoids and the preservation of the cricothyroid muscle function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

In some cases, this is not enough of a medialization due to a large posterior glottic chink, and an arytenoid adduction is required to provide better closure of the posterior glottis and supraglottis with ensuing improved vocal outcomes. This is a technically challenging procedure that is rarely required, but in select patients it is associated with significant improvements in voice. Lastly, laryngeal reinnervation, typically with the ansa cervicalis that supplies motor function to the strap muscles, can also be performed. This is the best approach in patients who have had a recurrent laryngeal nerve severed during a central or upper mediastinal neck procedure because it is in the field.54 Multiple studies demonstrate favorable outcomes; however, no significant differences between treatment arms has been demon-strated based on"

Injury to one RLN leads to paralysis of the ipsilateral vocal cord, which comes to lie in the parame-dian or the abducted position. The paramedian position results in a normal but weak voice, whereas the abducted position leads to a hoarse voice and an ineffective cough.

The arytenoid cartilages are abducted and the rima glottidis is triangular shaped (Fig. 8.225A). During forced inspiration (Fig. 8.225B), the arytenoid cartilages are rotated laterally, mainly by the action of the posterior crico-arytenoid muscles. As a result, the vocal folds are abducted and the rima glottidis widens into a rhomboid shape, which effectively increases the diameter of the laryngeal airway. When phonating, the arytenoid cartilages and vocal folds are adducted and air is forced through the closed rima glottidis (Fig. 8.225C). This action causes the vocal folds to vibrate against each other and produce sounds, which can then be modified by the upper parts of the airway and oral cavity. Tension in the vocal folds can be adjusted by the vocalis and cricothyroid muscles."

Repeat imaging is beneficial in this population within a 2-year period because many patients have undiagnosed small malignancies as the primary cause of their paralysis that are too small to detect on initial imaging.52 Laryngeal electro-myography can assist with identifying whether the paresis is a result of a paralysis or cricoarytenoid joint fixation/disloca-tion. It can also help prognosticate a paralysis. This is, however, rarely used in practice. Despite an extensive workup, 20% to 35% of cases are idiopathic.The management of bilateral vocal cord paralysis almost always requires a tracheotomy because the cords are left in a paramedian position leaving a slit light glottic aperture. If the paralysis is permanent, then a cordectomy with or without ary-tenoidectomy can be used to open up the airway in an attempt to eventually decannulate the patient. However, this has obvi-ous implications for voice with a weak and breathing voice. Many patients with a unilateral"

            "content": "The free margin between these two points of attachment is thickened to form the vocal ligament, which is under the vocal fold (true vocal cord) of the larynx. The conus elasticus is also thickened anteriorly in the midline to form a distinct median cricothyroid ligament, which spans the distance between the arch of cricoid cartilage and the inferior thyroid notch and adjacent deep surface of the thyroid cartilage up to the attachment of the vocal ligaments. In emergency situations, when the airway is blocked above the level of the vocal folds, the median cricothyroid ligament can be perforated to establish an airway. Except for small vessels and the occasional presence of a pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland, normally there are few structures between the median cricothyroid ligament and skin."

This photomicrograph shows three parts of the larynx: the vestibule above the ventricular folds, the ventricles between the vestibular folds and superior to the vocal folds, and the infraglottic cavity that extends from the vocal folds to the cricoid cartilage. Note that mucous glands are prominent in the ventricular folds and are covered by the typical pseudostratified ciliated epithelium. The vocal fold is composed of the epithelium, vocal ligament, and underlying vocalis muscle. Numerous lymph nodules are also present within the mucosa of the larynx (arrows). 10. b. High magnification of the area of the ventricular fold indicated by the upper rectangle in a shows on the left the pseudostratified ciliated epithelium that lines most of the larynx. Many nonsmoking adults and virtually all smokers exhibit patches of stratified squamous epithelium, as seen on the right of the micrograph. 240. c. High magnification of"

Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy can occur from disruption of the nerves anywhere along their course. Furthermore, interruption of the vagus nerves before the division of the recurrent laryngeal nerves can also produce vocal symptoms. Lung cancer in the apex of the right lung can affect the right recurrent laryngeal nerve, whereas cancers that infiltrate into the area between the pulmonary artery and aorta, an area known clinically as the \u201caortopulmonary window,\u201d can affect the left recurrent laryngeal nerve.

Immediately above the ventricle is another pair of mucosal folds, the ventricular folds, or false vocal cords (see Fig. 19.5 and Plate 70, page 690). These folds do not have the intrinsic muscular investment of the true vocal cords and therefore, do not modulate in phonation. They and the ventricle, however, are important in creating sound resonance. In\ufb02ammation and swelling of the larynx caused by viruses (such as in common cold virus) and other microbial agents is called acute laryngitis. Symptoms of acute laryngitis may include hoarseness or, in more severe cases, the total loss of voice, coughing, and difficulty with swallowing and breathing. Chronic laryngitis is usually caused by prolonged exposure of irritating agents such as tobacco smoke, dust, and/or polluted air."

A vocal fold polyp is more often unilateral than bilat-eral, is exophytic, and is associated with unorganized gelatinous debris in the subepithelial space. These can be hemorrhagic as is often seen in males secondary to capillary rupture within the mucosa by shearing forces during voice abuse. Hemorrhagic polyps are seen more often in patients on anticoagulants. These lesions usually fail conservative measures (voice rest, voice therapy, smoking cessation, and reflux management) usually requiring micorlaryngeal surgery to remove the lesion while preserving normal mucosa. Vocal fold cyst is an encapsulated lesion within the subepithelial or ligamentous space and is asso-ciated with reduced mucosal wave. It typically does not resolve with voice therapy. These lesions require microlaryngeal sur-gery for complete removal of the cyst while preserving the over-lying mucosa, and this surgery can be performed with cold steel or carbon dioxide (CO2) laser.
