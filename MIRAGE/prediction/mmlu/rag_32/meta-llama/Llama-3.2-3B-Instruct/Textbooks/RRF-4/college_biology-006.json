One X chromosome of the female is an example of such a chromosome. This fact can be used to identify the sex of a fetus. This chromosome was discovered in 1949 by Barr and Bartram in nerve cells of female cats, where it appears as a well-stained round body, now called the Barr body, adjacent to the nucleolus."

In cells of the oral mucous membrane, the Barr body is located adjacent to the nuclear envelope. In neutrophils, the Barr body forms a drumstick-shaped appendage on one of the nuclear lobes (Fig. 3.3). In both sections and smears, many cells must be examined to find those whose orientation is suitable for the display of the Barr body.

At the ultrastructural level, the Balbiani body is revealed as a localized accumulation of Golgi membranes and vesicles, endoplasmic reticulum, numerous mitochondria, and lysosomes. In addition, human oocytes contain annulate lamellae, and numerous small vesicles are scattered throughout the cytoplasm along with small, spherical mitochondria.

The supporting cell has a cylindrical shape and extends from the basement membrane through the full thickness of the epithelium. Immediately beneath this layer are the cell bodies of the olfactory receptor cells (OC ). They lie at different levels within the thickness of the epithelium.

Heterochromatin represents an especially compact form of chromatin (see Figure 4\u20139), and we are finally beginning to understand its molecular properties. It is highly concentrated in certain specialized regions, most notably at the centromeres and telomeres introduced previously (see Figure 4\u201319), but it is also present at many other locations along chromosomes\u2014locations that can vary according to the physiological state of the cell.

However, the same DNA is seen to occupy a larger territory when its genes are expressed, with elongated, punctate structures replacing the original dot. New ways of visualizing individual chromosomes have shown that each of the 46 interphase chromosomes in a human cell tends to occupy its own discrete ter- ritory within the nucleus: that is, the chromosomes are not extensively entangled with one another (Figure 4\u201353).

A cell with only one type of chromosome, present in maternal and paternal copies, is illustrated here. Once DNA replication is complete, the cell can enter M phase, when mitosis occurs and the nucleus is divided into two daughter nuclei. During this stage, the chromosomes condense, the nuclear envelope breaks down, and the mitotic spindle forms from microtubules and other proteins.

            "content": "The most basic function of the cell cycle is to duplicate the vast amount of DNA in the chromosomes and then segregate the copies into two genetically identical daughter cells. These processes define the two major phases of the cell cycle. Chromosome duplication occurs during S phase (S for DNA synthesis), which requires 10\u201312 hours and occupies about half of the cell-cycle time in a typical mammalian cell. After S phase, chromosome segregation and cell division occur in M phase (M for mitosis), which requires much less time (less than an hour in a mammalian cell). M phase comprises two major events: nuclear division, or mitosis, during which the copied chromosomes are distributed into a pair of daughter nuclei; and cytoplasmic division, or cytokinesis, when the cell itself divides in two (Figure 17\u20132)."
