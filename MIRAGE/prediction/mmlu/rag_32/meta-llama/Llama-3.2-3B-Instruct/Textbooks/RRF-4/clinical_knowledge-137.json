Tracheal compression by aberrant great vessels (aorta, innominate artery) may cause wheezing, stridor, cough, and dyspnea. The most common cause of tracheal compression is anterior compression from an anomalous innominate artery that arises more distally than normal from the aortic arch. This usually results in mild respiratory symptoms, and surgical correction is rarely necessary. Complete vascular rings, which compress the esophagus posteriorly and the trachea anteriorly, include the double aortic arch and a right aortic arch with a persistent ligamentum arteriosum (most common). Both lesions have right-sided aortic arches, which may be visible on chest radio-graph.

Infants with severe tracheomalacia may completely collapse their tracheas during agitation, resulting in cyanotic episodes that resemble breath-holding spells.

Intubation-related risk factors include pro-longed intubation; high tracheostomy through the first tracheal ring or cricothyroid membrane; transverse rather than vertical incision on the trachea; oversized tracheostomy tube; prior tra-cheostomy or intubation; and traumatic intubation. Stenosis is also more common in older patients, in women, after radiation, or after excessive corticosteroid therapy, and in the setting of concomitant diseases such as autoimmune disorders, severe reflux disease, or obstructive sleep apnea and the setting of severe respiratory failure. However, even a properly placed"

            "content": "distal esophagus and trachea, is seen in approximately 1% of all cases.Etiology and Pathologic Presentation. The esophagus and trachea share a common embryologic origin. At approximately 4 weeks\u2019 gestation, a diverticulum forms off the anterior aspect of the proximal foregut in the region of the primitive pharynx. This diverticulum extends caudally with progressive formation of the laryngo-tracheal groove, thus, creating a separate trachea and esophagus. Successful development of these structures is the consequence of extremely intricate interplay of growth and transcription factors necessary for rostral-caudal and anterior-posterior specification. The variations in clinically observed EA and TEF that must result in failure of successful formation of these structures are depicted in Fig. 39-8. While definitive genetic mutations have been difficult to identify in isolated EA-TEF, mutations in N-myc, Sox2, and CHD7 have been character-ized in syndromic EA-TEF with associated"

In the clinic Laryngoscopy is a medical procedure that is used to inspect the larynx. The functions of laryngoscopy include the evaluation of patients with difficulty swallowing, assessment of the vocal cords, and assessment of the larynx for tumors, masses, and weak voice."
