Kidney involvement, due either to deposition of calcium in the renal parenchyma or to recurrent nephrolithiasis, was present in 60\u201370% of patients prior to 1970. With earlier detection, renal complications occur in <20% of patients in many large series. Renal stones are usually composed of either calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate. In occasional patients, repeated episodes of nephrolithiasis or the formation of large calculi may lead to urinary tract obstruction, infection, and loss of renal function. Nephrocalcinosis may also cause decreased renal function and phosphate retention."

Calcium oxalate stones are most common (~75%); next, in order, are calcium phosphate (~15%), uric acid (~8%), struvite (~1%), and cystine (<1%) stones. Many stones are a mixture of crystal types (e.g., calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate) and also contain protein in the stone matrix. Rarely, stones are composed of medications, such as acyclovir, indinavir, and triamterene. Infectious stones, if not appropriately treated, can have devastating consequences and lead to end-stage renal disease. Consideration should be given to teaching practitioners strategies to prevent stone recurrence and its related morbidity."

Primary hyperoxaluria is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes excessive endogenous oxalate generation by the liver, with consequent calcium oxalate stone formation and crystal deposition in organs. Intraparenchymal calcium oxalate deposition in the kidney can eventually lead to renal failure. Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes abnormal reabsorption of filtered dibasic amino acids. The excessive urinary excretion of cystine, which is poorly soluble, leads to cystine stone formation. Cystine stones are visible on plain radiographs and often manifest as staghorn calculi or multiple bilateral stones. Repeat episodes of obstruction and instrumentation can cause chronic renal impairment. APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:"

The stones are polycrystalline aggregates of calcium, phosphate, oxalate, urate, and other soluble salts within an organic matrix. The urine becomes saturated with these salts, and small variations in the pH cause the salts to precipitate. Typically the patient has pain that radiates from the infrascapular region (loin) into the groin, and even into the scrotum or labia majora. Blood in the urine (hematuria) may also be noticed. Infection must be excluded because certain species of bacteria are commonly associated with urinary tract stones. The complications of urinary tract stones include infection, urinary obstruction, and renal failure. Stones may also develop within the bladder and produce marked irritation, causing pain and discomfort."

Often, 25-hydroxy vitamin D is measured in concert with PTH to investigate the possible role of secondarily elevated PTH levels in the setting of vitamin D insufficiency. The urinalysis, including examination of the sediment, can provide useful information. In individuals with asymptomatic residual renal stones, red and white blood cells are frequently present in urine. If there is concern about the possibility of an infection, a urine culture should be performed. The sediment may also reveal crystals (Fig. 342-1), which may help identify the stone type and also provide prognostic information, as crystalluria is a strong risk factor for new stone formation."

Since the maximum solubility of cystine in the physiologic urinary pH range of 4.5\u20137.0 is about 1200 \u03bcmol/L (300 mg/L), cystine needs to be diluted to 2.5\u20137 L of water to prevent crystalluria.

Symptoms and signs are those typical of urolithiasis: hematuria, flank pain, renal colic, obstructive uropathy, and infection (Chap. 342).

Smaller stones may pass into the ureter, where they may lodge and produce intense pain, known as renal or ureteral colic, characterized by paroxysms of flank pain radiating toward the groin. Often at this time there is gross hematuria. The clinical significance of stones lies in their capacity to obstruct urine flow or to produce sufficient trauma to cause ulceration and bleeding. In either case, they predispose the sufferer to bacterial infection. In most cases, the diagnosis is readily made radiologically."

The causes of the other types of renal stones are better understood. Magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) stones almost always occur in individuals with a persistently alkaline urine resulting from UTIs. In particular, infections with urea-splitting bacteria, such as Proteus vulgaris and staphylococci, predispose individuals to urolithiasis.

Renal biopsies of stone formers have revealed calcium phosphate in the renal interstitium. It is hypothesized that this calcium phosphate extends down to the papilla and erodes through the papillary epithelium, where it provides a site for deposition of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate crystals. The majority of calcium oxalate stones grow on calcium phosphate at the tip of the renal papilla (Randall\u2019s plaque). Thus, the process of stone formation may begin years before a clinically detectable stone is identified. The processes involved in interstitial deposition are under active investigation.

However, there are standard approaches to patients with acute and chronic presentations that can reasonably guide the clinical evaluation. It typically requires weeks to months (and often much longer) for a kidney stone to grow to a clinically detectable size. Although the passage of a stone is a dramatic event, stone formation and growth are characteristically clinically silent. A stone can remain asymptomatic in the kidney for years or even decades before signs (e.g., hematuria) or symptoms (e.g., pain) become apparent. Thus, it is important to remember that the onset of symptoms, typically attributable to a stone moving into the ureter, does not provide insight into when the stone actually formed.

Because serum calcium is now routinely assessed in most patients who need blood tests for unrelated conditions, hyperparathyroidism is usually detected early in its course. Hence, many of the classic clinical manifestations, particularly those referable to bone and renal disease, are seen much less frequently. Additional signs and symptoms that may be encountered in some cases include the following: Gastrointestinal disturbances, including constipation, nausea, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, and gallstones Central nervous system alterations, including depression, lethargy, and seizures"

The kidney becomes involved when the calcium \u00d7 phosphate product in serum rises above the point at which ectopic calcification occurs (nephrocalcinosis) or when the calcium \u00d7 oxalate (or phosphate) product in urine exceeds saturation, leading to nephrolithiasis. Subtle early indicators of such renal involvement include polyuria, nocturia, and hyposthenuria. Radiologic evidence of nephrocalcinosis and stones is not generally observed until later. The degree of the ensuing renal failure is best followed by monitoring the decline in creatinine clearance. On the other hand, chronic kidney disease can be a primary cause of bone disease because of altered handling of calcium and phosphate, decreased 1,25(OH)2D production, increased FGF23 levels, and secondary hyperparathyroidism."

Chronic treatment for all types of metabolic stonesinvolves vigorous fluid intake, usually twice maintenance rates.Infection-related stones require treatment of infection and oftenremoval of the stone as well as correction of any predisposinganatomic abnormality. Specific metabolic conditions require specific treatments; for IHC, normal calcium intake with low sodium and low oxalate intake is prescribed. For some children with IHC,potassium citrate or thiazides are required to minimize stonerecurrence. Lithotripsy or surgery by a pediatric urologist may berequired for children with large, infected, or obstructing stones."

(Reproduced, with permission, from Chen MY, Pope TL Jr., Ott DJ. Basic Radiology, 1st ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2004: 243.) Noncontrast abdominal CT scans are the gold standard for the diagnosis of kidney stones. Consider a renal ultrasound to look for obstruction (ultrasound is also preferred for pregnant patients, in whom radiation from CT should be avoided). An IVP can be used to confirm the diagnosis if there is a lack of contrast filling below the stone. Hydration and analgesia are the initial treatment. Kidney stones < 5 mm in diameter can pass through the urethra; stones < 3 cm in diameter can be treated with extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL), percutaneous nephrolithotomy, or retrograde ureteroscopy. Preventive measures include hydration; additional prophylaxis is dependent on stone composition."
