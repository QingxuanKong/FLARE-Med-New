    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the potential side effects of the listed medications, particularly those that could cause respiratory issues. Apraclonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist used to reduce intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. It's not commonly associated with respiratory issues. Epinephrine is a sympathomimetic agent that can cause bronchospasm and increased heart rate, but it's not typically used as an eyedrop for glaucoma. Latanoprost is a prostaglandin analog that can increase the outflow of aqueous humor, reducing intraocular pressure. It's not commonly associated with respiratory issues. Timolol is a beta-blocker used to reduce intraocular pressure by decreasing aqueous production. Beta-blockers can cause respiratory issues such as bronchospasm, especially in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Given the patient's history of smoking, which is a risk factor for COPD, the most likely cause of the development of shortness of breath in this patient is the use of Timolol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Only acute angle-closure glaucoma causes a red or painful eye, from abrupt elevation of intraocular pressure. In all forms of glaucoma, foveal acuity is spared until end-stage disease is reached. For these reasons, severe and irreversible damage can occur before either the patient or the physician recognizes the diagnosis. Screening of patients for glaucoma by noting the cup-to-disc ratio on ophthalmoscopy and by measuring intraocular pressure is vital. Glaucoma is treated with topical adrenergic agonists, cholinergic agonists, beta blockers, and prostaglandin analogues. Occasionally, systemic absorption of beta blocker from eyedrops can be sufficient to cause side effects of bradycardia, hypotension, heart block, bronchospasm, or depression.

            "content": "This drug, long used in the treatment of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, is not neurotoxic when given in the usual systemic daily doses of 100 to 200 mg/m2. The administration of very high doses (up to 30 times the usual dose) induces remissions in patients\u2019 refractory to conventional treatments. It also may produce, however, a severe degree of cerebellar degeneration in a considerable proportion of cases (4 of 24 reported by Winkelman and Hines). Ataxia of gait and limbs, dysarthria, and nystagmus develop as early as 5 to 7 days after the beginning of high-dose treatment and worsen rapidly. Postmortem examination has disclosed a diffuse degeneration of Purkinje cells, most marked in the depths of the folia, as well as a patchy degeneration of other elements of the cerebellar cortex. Other patients receiving high-dose ara-C have developed a mild, reversible cerebellar syndrome with the same clinical features. Because patients older than 50 years of age are said to be far more likely to"

            "content": "Acute angle-closure glaucoma is a medical emergency that is frequently treated initially with drugs but usually requires surgery for permanent correction. Initial therapy often consists of a combination of a direct muscarinic agonist (eg, pilocarpine) and other drugs. Once the intraocular pressure is controlled and the danger of vision loss is diminished, the patient can be prepared for corrective surgery (laser iridotomy). Open-angle glaucoma and some cases of secondary glaucoma are chronic diseases that are not amenable to traditional surgical correction, although newer laser techniques appear to be useful. Other treatments for glaucoma are described in the Box: The Treatment of Glaucoma in Chapter 10. Accommodative esotropia (strabismus caused by hypermetropic accommodative error) in young children is sometimes diagnosed and treated with cholinomimetic agonists. Dosage is similar to or higher than that used for glaucoma. B. Gastrointestinal and Urinary Tracts"

She is comatose, tachypneic (25 breaths per minute), and tachycardic (150 bpm), but she appears flushed, and fingertip pulse oximetry is normal (97%) breathing room air. Questioning of her parents reveals that they are homeless and have been living in their car (a small van). The nights have been cold, and they have used a small char-coal burner to keep warm inside the vehicle. What is the most likely diagnosis? What treatment should be instituted immediately? If her mother is pregnant, what additional measures should be taken?"

Males are affected more often than females; average age of onset is 25. Hx/PE: Presents as a brief, excruciating, unilateral periorbital headache that lasts 30 minutes to three hours, during which the patient tends to be extremely restless. Attacks tend to occur in clusters, affecting the same part of the head at the same time of day (commonly during sleep) and in a certain season of the year. Associated symptoms include ipsilateral lacrimation of the eye, conjunctival injection, Horner\u2019s syndrome, and nasal stuffiness."
