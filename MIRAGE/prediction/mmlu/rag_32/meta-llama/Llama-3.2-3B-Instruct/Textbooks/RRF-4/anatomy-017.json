            "content": "Phenotypic sex refers to the structures of the external and internal genitalia and secondary sex characteristics. The developing testis releases anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH; also known as m\u00fcllerianinhibiting substance [MIS]) from Sertoli cells and testosterone from Leydig cells. AMH is a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF) \u03b2 family and acts through specific receptors to cause regression of the m\u00fcllerian structures from 60\u201380 days after conception. At ~60\u2013140 days after conception, testosterone supports the development of wolffian structures, including the epididymides, vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles. Testosterone is the precursor for dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent androgen that promotes development of the external genitalia, including the penis and scrotum (65\u2013100 days, and thereafter) (Fig. 410-3). The urogenital sinus develops into the prostate and prostatic urethra in the male and into the urethra and lower portion of the vagina in the female. The genital"

            "content": "In men, approximately 8 mg of testosterone is produced daily. About 95% is produced by the Leydig cells and only 5% by the adrenals. The testis also secretes small amounts of another potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone, as well as androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone, which are weak androgens. Pregnenolone and progesterone and their 17-hydroxylated derivatives are also released in small amounts. Plasma levels of testosterone in males are about 0.6 mcg/dL after puberty and appear to decline after age 50. Testosterone is also present in the plasma of women in concentrations of approximately 0.03 mcg/dL and is derived in approximately equal parts from the ovaries and adrenals and by the peripheral conversion of other hormones."

What fraction of the receptors will have hormone bound? If a meaningful physiological response occurs when 50% of the receptors have bound a hormone molecule, how much will the concentration of hormone have to rise to elicit a response? The fraction of receptors (R) bound to hormone (H) to form a receptor\u2013hormone complex (R\u2013H) is [R\u2013H]/ ([R] + [R\u2013H]) = [R\u2013H]/[R]TOT = [H]/([H] + Kd). 15\u20138 Cells communicate in ways that resemble human communication.

            "content": "Fig. 44.23 ). Events that follow are numbered according to Fig. 44.24 : Event 1: In the absence of fertilization and implantation, the corpus luteum regresses and dies (called luteolysis). This leads to a dramatic decline in levels of progesterone, estrogen, and inhibin by day 24 of the menstrual cycle. Event 2: The pituitary gonadotrope perceives the end of luteal function as a release from negative feedback (see Fig. 44.23B , Late Luteal Phase). This leads to an increase in FSH about 2 days before the onset of menstruation. The basis for the selective increase in FSH is incompletely understood, but it may be due to the slow frequency of GnRH pulses during the luteal phase, which in turn is due to high progesterone levels.
