The parotid duct, also known as Stensen's duct, is a serous duct that carries saliva from the parotid gland to the oral cavity. According to Document [2] (Title: Anatomy_Gray), the parotid duct leaves the anterior edge of the parotid gland midway between the zygomatic arch and the corner of the mouth. It then crosses the face in a transverse direction and turns deeply into the buccal fat pad and pierces the buccinator muscle. Finally, it opens into the oral cavity near the second upper molar tooth. This indicates that the parotid duct is superficial to the masseter muscle and enters the mouth opposite the upper second molar tooth. Therefore, the correct answer is B. superficial to masseter and enters the mouth opposite the upper second molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

These include pleomorphic adenoma and adenolymphoma. Their importance is in relation to their anatomical position. The relationship of any tumor to the branches of the facial nerve [VII] must be defined because resection of the tumor may damage the nerve. It is not uncommon for stones to develop within the parotid gland. They typically occur within the main confluence of the ducts and within the main parotid duct. The patient usually complains of intense pain when salivating and tends to avoid foods that produce this symptom. The pain can be easily reproduced in the clinic by squirting lemon juice into the patient\u2019s mouth."

The formation of stones in the salivary glands is not uncommon, but it is more likely in the submandibular gland than in the parotid gland because the saliva is more mucinous and the duct has a long upward course from the floor of the mouth. Nevertheless, stones do form in the parotid gland and the parotid ducts. Notably, most parotid duct calculi and submandibular duct calculi occur in mouths with excellent dental hygiene and mucosa. An ultrasound scan was performed. An initial ultrasound scan demonstrated a stone in the distal end of the right parotid duct with evidence of ductal dilation (eFig. 8.294). Assessment of the gland also demonstrated dilated ducts within the gland and evidence of intraparotid lymphadenopathy. The patient was treated with antibiotics."

            "content": "The complex, branching network of intralobular ducts drains into the larger interlobular ducts, which are lined with a low columnar epithelium in which enteroendocrine cells and occasional goblet cells may be found. The interlobular ducts, in turn, drain directly into the main pancreatic duct, which runs the length of the gland parallel to its long axis, giving this portion of the duct system a herringbone-like appearance (see Fig. 18.19). A second large duct, the accessory pancreatic duct, arises in the head of the pancreas. The intercalated ducts add bicarbonate and water to the exocrine secretion."

The duct then runs obliquely downward within the wall of the duodenum for 1 to 2 cm before opening on a papilla of mucous membrane (ampulla of Vater), about 10 cm distal to the pylorus.The union of the common bile duct and the main pan-creatic duct follows one of three configurations. In about 70% of people, these ducts unite outside the duodenal wall and tra-verse the duodenal wall as a single duct. In about 20%, they join within the duodenal wall and have a short or no common duct, but open through the same opening into the duodenum. In about 10%, they exit via separate openings into the duodenum, termed pancreas divisum. The sphincter of Oddi, a thick coat of circular smooth muscle, surrounds the common bile duct at the ampulla of Vater (Fig. 32-3). It controls the flow of bile, and in some cases pancreatic juice, into the duodenum.The extrahepatic bile ducts are lined by a columnar mucosa with numerous mucous glands that are"

The serous cells are optimally preserved in this specimen and reveal their secretory (zymogen) granules. The granules appear as fine dot-like objects within the cytoplasm. The acinus in the upper right of the figure has been cut in cross section and reveals the acinar lumen (AL). The small rectangle drawn in the acinus represents an area comparable to the electron micrograph shown as Figure 16.23. The large acinar profile to the left of the striated duct (StD) shows that the acini are not simple spheres but, rather, irregular elongate structures. Because of the small size of the acinar lumen and the variability in sectioning an acinus, the lumen is seen infrequently."
