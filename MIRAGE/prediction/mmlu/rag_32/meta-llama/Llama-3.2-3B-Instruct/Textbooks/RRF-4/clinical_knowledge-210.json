Serial peak flow readings are commonly used to monitor asthma. According to Document [0], a variation of serial peak flow readings over a two-week period can indicate the presence of asthma. This is because asthma is characterized by variable and intermittent airway obstruction, which can be reflected in changes in peak flow readings. The other options, COPD, pneumonia, and tuberculosis, may also affect lung function, but serial peak flow readings are not typically used as a diagnostic tool for these conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is related to asthma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

To use a peak flow meter, a child should be standing with the indicator placed at the bottom of the scale. The child must inhale deeply, place the device in the mouth, seal the lips around the mouthpiece, and blow out forcefully and rapidly. The indicator moves up the numeric scale. The PEFR is the highest number achieved. The test is repeated three times to obtain the best possible effort. Peak flow meters are available as low range (<300 L/sec) and high range (<700 L/sec). It is important to provide the appropriate range meter so that accurate measurements can be obtained and children do not become discouraged because their exhalations barely move the indicator."

Lung Function Tests Simple spirometry confirms airflow limitation with a reduced FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, and PEF (Fig. 309-6). Reversibility is demonstrated by a >12% and 200-mL increase in FEV1 15 min after an inhaled short-acting \u03b22-agonist or in some patients by a 2to 4-week trial of oral corticosteroids (OCS) (prednisone or prednisolone 30\u201340 mg daily). Measurements of PEF twice daily may confirm the diurnal variations in airflow obstruction. Flow-volume loops show reduced peak flow and reduced maximum expiratory flow. Further lung function tests are rarely necessary, but whole-body plethysmography shows increased airway resistance and may show increased total lung capacity and residual volume. Gas diffusion is usually normal, but there may be a small increase in gas transfer in some patients."

According to Freeman and associates (2003), no evidence suggests that the distinction between short-and long-term variability has clinical relevance. Similarly, the NICHD Workshop (1997) did not recommend diferentiating short-and long-term variability because in actual practice they are visually determined as a unit. The workshop panel defined baseline variability as those baseline luctuations of two cycles per minute or greater. They recommended the criteria shown in Figure 24-8 for quantification of variability. Normal beatto-beat variability was accepted to be 6 to 25 bpm."

The probe is connected to a monitor which continuously displays the blood flow velocity profile in the descending aorta as well as the calculated QT. In order to maximize the accuracy of the device, the probe position must be adjusted to obtain the peak velocity in the aorta. In order to transform blood flow in the descending aorta into QT, a correction factor is applied that is based on the assumption that only 70% of the flow at the root of the aorta is still present in the descending thoracic aorta.

            "content": "Air FLow As noted above, spirometry plays a key role in lung volume determination. Even more often, spirometry is used to measure airflow, which reflects the dynamic properties of the lung. During an FVC maneuver, the patient inhales to TLC and then exhales rapidly and forcefully to RV; this method ensures that flow limitation has been achieved, so that the precise effort made has little influence on actual flow. The total amount of air exhaled is the FVC, and the amount of air exhaled in the first second is the FEV1; the FEV1 is a flow rate, revealing volume change per time. Like lung volumes, an individual\u2019s maximal expiratory flows should be compared with predicted values based on height, age, and sex. While the FEV1/FVC ratio is typically reduced in airflow obstruction, this condition can also reduce FVC by raising RV, sometimes rendering the FEV1/FVC ratio \u201cartifactually normal\u201d with the erroneous implication that airflow obstruction is absent. To circumvent this problem, it is"

            "content": "Gathering neurologic history follows the traditional medical model with two additions: the pace of the process and the localization of the problem. The symptom evolution provides clues to the underlying process as symptoms may evolve in a progressive, static, or episodic fashion. Progressive symptoms may evolve suddenly (seizures, stroke); acutely over minutes or hours (epidural hemorrhage); subacutely over days or weeks (brain tumor); or slowly over years (hereditary neuropathies). Static neurologic abnormalities are observed early in life and do not change in character over time (cerebral palsy). Static lesions are often caused by congenital brain abnormalities or prenatal/perinatal brain injury. Intermittent attacks of recurrent, stereotyped episodes suggest epilepsy or migraine syndromes, among others. Episodic disorders are characterized by periods of symptoms, followed by partial or complete recovery (demyelinating, autoimmune, vascular diseases)."
