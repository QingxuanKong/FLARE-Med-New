The situation in eukaryotes is substantially different. In particular, transcription is only the first of several steps needed to produce a mature mRNA molecule. Other critical steps are the covalent modification of the ends of the RNA and the removal of intron sequences that are discarded from the middle of the RNA transcript by the process of RNA splicing (Figure 6\u201320). Both ends of eukaryotic mRNAs are modified: by capping on the 5\u02b9 end and by polyadenylation of the 3\u02b9 end (Figure 6\u201321). These special ends allow the cell to assess whether both ends of an mRNA molecule are present (and if the message is therefore intact) before it exports the RNA from the nucleus and translates it"

In some cases, two distinct protein-coding sequences are carried in tandem on the same eukaryotic mRNA; translation of the first occurs by the usual scanning mechanism, and translation of the second occurs through an IRES. IRESs are typically several hundred nucleotides in length and fold into specific structures that bind many, but not all, of the same proteins that are used to initiate normal 5\u02b9 cap-dependent translation (Figure 7\u201368).

These factors typically associate with RNA polymerase shortly after initiation and help the polymerase move through the wide variety of different DNA sequences that are found in genes. Eukaryotic RNA polymerases must also contend with chromatin structure as they move along a DNA template, and they are typically aided by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes that either move with the polymerase or may simply seek out and rescue the occasional stalled polymerase.

As described in Chapter 6, the export of RNA molecules from the nucleus is delayed until processing has been completed. However, mechanisms that deliberately override this control point can be used to regulate gene expression. This strategy forms the basis for one of the best-understood examples of regulated nuclear transport of mRNA, which occurs in the human AIDS virus, HIV."

            "content": "The answer is that, as an RNA molecule is processed, it loses certain proteins and acquires others. For example, we have seen that acquisition of cap-binding complexes, exon junction complexes, and poly-A-binding proteins mark the completion of capping, splicing, and poly-A addition, respectively. A properly completed mRNA molecule is also distinguished by the proteins it lacks. For example, the presence of an snRNP protein would signify incomplete or aberrant splicing. Only when the proteins present on an mRNA molecule collectively signify that processing was successfully completed is the mRNA exported from the nucleus into the cytosol, where it can be translated into protein. Improperly processed mRNAs"

            "content": "If differences among the various cell types of an organism depend on the particular genes that the cells express, at what level is the control of gene expression exercised? As we saw in the previous chapter, there are many steps in the pathway leading from DNA to protein. We now know that all of them can in principle be regulated. Thus a cell can control the proteins it makes by (1) controlling when and how often a given gene is transcribed (transcriptional control), (2) controlling the splicing and processing of RNA transcripts (RNA processing control), (3) selecting which completed mRNAs are exported from the nucleus to the cytosol and determining where in the cytosol they are localized (RNA transport and localization control), (4) selecting which mRNAs in the cytoplasm are translated by ribosomes (translational control), (5) selectively destabilizing certain mRNA molecules in the cytoplasm (mRNA degradation control), or (6) selectively activating, inactivating, degrading, or"

            "content": "IV. EUKARYOTIC GENE TRANSCRIPTION The transcription of eukaryotic genes is a far more complicated process than transcription in prokaryotes. Eukaryotic transcription involves separate polymerases for the synthesis of rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA. In addition, a large number of proteins called transcription factors (TF) are involved. TF bind to distinct sites on the DNA within the core promoter region, close (proximal) to it, or some distance away (distal). They are required for both the assembly of a transcription initiation complex at the promoter and the determination of which genes are to be transcribed. [Note: Each eukaryotic RNA pol has its own promoters and TF that bind core promoter sequences.] For TF to recognize and bind to their specific DNA sequences, the chromatin structure in that region must be decondensed (relaxed) to allow access to the DNA. The role of transcription in the regulation of gene expression is discussed in Chapter 33. A. Chromatin structure and gene expression"

Proteins synthesis begins within the nucleus with transcription, during which the genetic code for a protein is transcribed from DNA to mRNA precursors. After post-transcriptional modifcations of the premRNA molecule\u2014which include RNA cleavage, excision of introns, rejoining of exons, and capping by addition of poly(A) tracks at the 3 end and methylguanosine cap at the 5 end\u2014 the resulting mRNA molecule leaves the nucleus into the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, the mRNA sequence is read by the ribosomal complex in the process of translation to form a polypeptide chain. The frst group of 15 to 60 amino acids on the amino-terminus of a newly synthesized polypeptide forms a signal sequence (signal peptide) that directs protein to its destination (i.e., lumen of rER). The signal peptide interacts with a signal-recognition particle (SRP), which arrests further growth of the polypeptide chain until its relocation toward the rER"
