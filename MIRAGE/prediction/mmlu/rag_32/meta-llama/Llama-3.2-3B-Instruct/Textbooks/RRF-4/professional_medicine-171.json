The key details provided are: \\u00b7 The male stillborn is delivered at 32 weeks' gestation to a 30-year-old woman. \\u00b7 The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios. \\u00b7 Examination of the stillborn shows the absence of a urethral opening.\\n\\nGiven the absence of a urethral opening, we can infer that the stillborn male has a genitourinary anomaly. The presence of oligohydramnios is also a critical piece of information, as it suggests a possible urinary tract obstruction. The most common etiology of distal obstruction of the urinary tract is posterior urethral valves, which is more frequent in male fetuses. Therefore, the absence of a urethral opening and oligohydramnios are consistent with this diagnosis.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate the options provided:\\n\\nA. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia - This condition involves a hole in the diaphragm that allows abdominal organs to move into the chest cavity. While it can cause respiratory distress, it is not directly related to the absence of a urethral opening or oligohydramnios.\\n\\nB. Intralobar sequestration - This is a rare congenital anomaly where a portion of lung tissue is separated from the rest of the lung and receives its blood supply from a systemic artery rather than the pulmonary arteries. It does not directly relate to the absence of a urethral opening or oligohydramnios.\\n\\nC. Pulmonary hypoplasia - This condition involves underdevelopment of the lungs, which can be caused by various factors, including oligohydramnios. However, it is not directly related to the absence of a urethral opening.\\n\\nD. Situs inversus - This is a condition where the internal organs are reversed or mirrored from their normal positions. While it can be associated with various congenital anomalies, it is not directly related to the absence of a urethral opening or oligohydramnios.\\n\\nConsidering the given information and the options provided, the most likely additional finding in this stillborn is pulmonary hypoplasia, as it is a common complication of oligohydramnios and can be caused by a distal urinary tract obstruction, such as posterior urethral valves.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

Characteristically, the bladder and proximal urethra are dilated, termed the \"keyhole\" sign, and the bladder wall is thick (Fig. 10-45). Oligohydramnios, particularly before midpregnancy, portends a poor prognosis because of pulmonary hypoplasia. Unfortunately, the outcome may be poor even with normal amnionic fluid volume. Evaluation includes a careful search for associated anomalies, which may occur in 40 percent of cases, and for aneuploidy, which has been reported in 5 to 8 percent (Hayden, 1988; Hobbins, 1984; Mann, 2010). If neither are present, afected male fetuses with severe oligohydramnios who have fetal urinary electrolytes suggesting a potentially favorable prognosis may be fetal therapy candidates. Evaluation and treatment of fetal bladder outlet obstruction is discussed in Chapter 16 (p. 325)."

There was one subsequent stillbirth, and only three fetuses had abnormal testing results before 32 weeks. Notably, no relationship was found between the gestational age of the previous stillborn fetus and the incidence or timing of abnormal test results or fetal jeopardy in the subsequent pregnancy. These investigators concluded that antepartum surveillance should begin at 32 weeks or later in the otherwise healthy woman with a history of stillbirth. This recommendation is supported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2016a) with the caveat that it increases the iatrogenic preterm delivery rate. Although fetal movement counting strategies are routinely employed as described in Chapter 17 (p. 332), few data guide its use in clinical practice for those with a prior stillbirth (Mangesi, 2015)."

Moreover, meconium release into an already reduced amnionic luid volume results in thick, viscous meconium that may cause meconium aspiration syndrome (Chap. 33, p. 620). Trimmer and coworkers (1990) sonographically measured hourly fetal urine production using sequential bladder volume measurements in 38 postterm pregnancies. Diminished urine production was found to be associated with oligohydramnios. They hypothesized that decreased fetal urine flow was likely the result of preexisting oligohydramnios that limited fetal swallowing. Oz and associates (2002), using Doppler waveforms, concluded that fetal renal blood low is reduced in those postterm pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios. s a possible cause, again, the study by Link and associates (2007) showed that umbilical blood flow did not increase past term."

Also, from a recent metaanalysis of 15 studies involving more than 35,000 pregnancies, high-risk pregnancies with oligohydramnios were more likely to be complicated by low birthweight compared with low-risk pregnancies with oligohydramnios (Rabie, 2017).

Delivery may be the best option for the compromised fetus yet may result in death from immaturity of the cotwin. If fetal lung maturity is conirmed, salvage of both the healthy fetus and its jeopardized sibling is possible. Unfortunately, ideal management if twins are immature is problematic but should be based on the chances of intact survival for both fetuses. Often the compromised fetus is severely growth restricted or anomalous. Thus, performing amniocentesis for fetal chromosomal analysis in women of advanced maternal age carrying twin pregnancies is advantageous, even for those who would continue their pregnancies regardless of the diagnosis.

If no amnionic luid is visible beyond the mid-second trimester due to a genitourinary etiology, the prognosis is extremely poor unless fetal therapy is an option.

However, in 44 women managed as outpatients and admitted only for obstetrical indications, there were 13 stillbirths. Because of this report, women with monoamnionic twins are recommended to undergo 1 hour of daily fetal heart rate monitoring, either as an outpatient or inpatient, beginning at 26 to 28 weeks' gestation. With initial testing, a course of betamethasone is given to promote pulmonary maturation (Chap. 42, p. 823). If fetal testing remains reassuring and no other intervening indications arise, cesarean delivery is performed at 32 to 34 weeks. A second course of betamethasone can be given before this (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2016). his management scheme is used at Parkland Hospital and resulted in the successful 34-week delivery of the"
