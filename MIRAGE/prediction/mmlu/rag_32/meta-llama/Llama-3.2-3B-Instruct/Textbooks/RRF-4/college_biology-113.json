    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the kinetics of the reaction catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase. The reaction is as follows: Acetaldehyde + NAD+ \u2192 Ethanol + NADH. The rate of reaction increases with the concentration of acetaldehyde until it reaches a maximum velocity (Vmax), at which point further increases in acetaldehyde concentration have no effect. This is because the enzyme molecules are saturated with acetaldehyde molecules. Therefore, we can conclude that at the maximal rate of reaction, nearly all of the enzyme molecules are interacting with acetaldehyde molecules. This is a characteristic of an enzyme at saturation, where the substrate binding sites are fully occupied. This allows us to eliminate options B, C, and D. The change in free energy of the reaction does not directly relate to the saturation of the enzyme with substrate, so C is not correct. The activation energy of the reaction may be affected by the concentration of acetaldehyde, but this is not directly related to the saturation of the enzyme with substrate, so B is not correct. The enzyme is still specific for acetaldehyde at the maximal rate of reaction, so D is not correct. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

Actually, slightly more alcohol is metabolized per hour when the initial concentrations are very high, and repeated ingestion of alcohol may facilitate its metabolism, but these increments are of little clinical significance. In contrast, the rate of oxidation of acetaldehyde does depend on its concentration in the tissues. This fact is of importance in connection with the drug disulfiram (Antabuse), which acts by raising the tissue concentration necessary for the metabolism of a certain amount of acetaldehyde per unit of time. The patient taking both disulfiram and alcohol will accumulate an inordinate amount of acetaldehyde, resulting in nausea, vomiting, and hypotension,"

The flushing reaction has been traced to a deficiency of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (Harada et al).

Chronic alcohol consumption can also result in alcoholic fatty liver because of increased hepatic synthesis of TAG coupled with impaired formation or release of VLDL. This occurs as a result of decreased FA oxidation because of a fall in the NAD+/NADH ratio and increased lipogenesis because of the increased availability of FA (decreased catabolism) and of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (the dehydrogenase is inhibited by the low NAD+/NADH ratio; see p. 101). With continued alcohol consumption, alcoholic fatty liver can progress first to alcoholic hepatitis and then to alcoholic cirrhosis. V. CHAPTER SUMMARY"

Both fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and adenosine monophosphate inhibit fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase of gluconeogenesis and activate phosphofructokinase-1 of glycolysis. This results in reciprocal regulation of the two pathways. 0.5. The metabolism of ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase produces reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) from the oxidized (NAD+) form. What effect is the fall in the NAD+/NADH ratio expected to have on gluconeogenesis? Explain."

Different enzymes show different responses to changes in substrate concentration, temperature, and pH. This section describes factors that influence the reaction velocity of enzymes. Enzymic responses to these factors give us valuable clues as to how enzymes function in living cells (that is, in vivo). A. Substrate concentration 1. Maximal velocity: The rate or velocity of a reaction (v) is the number of substrate molecules converted to product per unit time. Velocity is usually expressed as \u00b5mol of product formed per minute. The rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction increases with substrate concentration until a maximal velocity (Vmax) is reached (Fig. 5.6). The leveling off of the reaction rate at high substrate concentrations reflects the saturation with substrate of all available binding sites on the enzyme molecules present. 2."
