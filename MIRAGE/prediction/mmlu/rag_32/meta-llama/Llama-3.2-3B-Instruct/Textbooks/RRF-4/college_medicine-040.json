    "question": "A teacher sets up a reward system for her elementary school students. At the end of each day, she gives a sticker to each student who showed up on time that morning. At the end of each week, she gives a sticker to any student who got above a 90% on three quizzes in a row. After months of this regimen, she finds that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but that tardiness has only decreased slightly. Which of the following best explains the teacher\u2019s observation?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.",
        "B": "The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.",
        "C": "The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.",
        "D": "The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the different types of schedules in operant conditioning and how they affect behavior. The teacher's reward system uses a combination of schedules, but the key detail is that students receive a sticker at the end of the week for meeting a specific criterion (getting above a 90% on three quizzes in a row). This suggests that the schedule is likely a fixed-ratio (FR) schedule, where a fixed number of responses (in this case, 3 quizzes) are required to receive a reward (a sticker). The fact that performance on quizzes increased significantly but tardiness decreased only slightly suggests that the FR schedule was more effective for the behavior that was reinforced (quizzes), while the variable ratio schedule (receiving a sticker at the end of the day) may have been less effective for the behavior that was not reinforced (tardiness). Variable ratio schedules create strong responses and behavior that is susceptible to extinction, but in this case, the FR schedule may have been more effective for the behavior that was reinforced.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

If methylphenidate proves ineffective after several weeks or cannot be tolerated, dextroamphetamine 2.5 to 5 mg three times daily or a mixed amphetamine-dextroamphetamine is suitable substitute. Atomoxetine, a norepinephrine inhibitor, is also effective and is not classified as a stimulant but has caused a few cases of liver failure.

Early Head Start (less than 3 years), Head Start (3 to 4 years), and prekindergarten programs (4 to 5 years) all demonstrate better educational attainment, although the earlier the start, the better the results. Readiness for preschool depends on the development of autonomy and the ability of the parent and the child to separate for hours at a time.

The capacity to reproduce them at intervals after committing them to memory is a test of memory span. d. Another test of memory and verbal fluency we have found useful is the generation of a list of objects in a category; ask the patient to give the names of animals, vegetables, or makes of cars, as many as come to mind in 30 s or so; most individuals can list at least 12 items in each category. e. Visual facility: Show the patient a picture of several objects; then ask him to name the objects."

In addition to meticulous attention to sleep hygiene and bedtime practices, difficulty fallingasleep and bedtime resistance in young children are treated byspecific behavioral strategies. Systematic ignoring consists of not responding to a child\u2019s demands for parental attention at bedtime. Unmodified extinction (\u201ccry it out\u201d) involves putting thechild to bed and then ignoring the child\u2019s demands until thenext morning. Graduated extinction involves waiting successively longer periods of time before briefly checking on the child.Both methods are effective in decreasing bedtime resistance andenabling young children to fall asleep independently. Positivereinforcement strategies can also be used in preschool-aged and older children. These include rewards (e.g., stickers) for meeting a bedtime goal (e.g., staying in bed). Rewards should beprovided immediately (first thing in the morning) to"

Sleepy students often have trouble staying alert and performing well in school, and sleepy adults struggle to stay awake and focused on their work. More than half of Americans have fallen asleep while driving. An estimated 1.2 million motor vehicle crashes per year are due to drowsy drivers, causing about 20% of all serious crash injuries and deaths. One needn\u2019t fall asleep to have an accident, as the inattention and slowed responses of drowsy drivers are a major contributor. Reaction time is equally impaired by 24 h of sleep loss as by a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 g/dL."

Most entries also include Summary Comments that describe the style and utility of each book for studying. Finally, each book receives a Rating. The books are sorted into a comprehensive section as well as into sections corresponding to the six clinical disciplines (internal medicine, neurology, OB/GYN, pediatrics, psychiatry, and surgery). Within each section, books are arranged first by Rating, then by Author, and finally by Title."
