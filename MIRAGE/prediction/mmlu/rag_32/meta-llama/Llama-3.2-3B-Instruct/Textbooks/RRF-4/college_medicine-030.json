This process of making connections between existing knowledge and new information is known as elaborative rehearsal. The student is actively using his existing knowledge to build upon and organize new information, which is a key characteristic of elaborative rehearsal. This approach helps the student to better retain the information and to see the relationships between different concepts. The student is not simply memorizing new information, but rather using his existing knowledge to create new connections and understandings. This process is also known as \\u201cworking memory\\u201d and is a key component of the elaborative rehearsal process. The student is not chunking, which involves breaking down information into smaller pieces and organizing them into categories, or maintenance rehearsal, which involves repeating information over and over again to try to commit it to long-term memory. The student is not using a network model, which is a visual representation of relationships between concepts, although he is making connections between different concepts. Therefore, the student\\u2019s process is best characterized as elaborative rehearsal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Specifically, the cardiac muscle cells are connected together to form an electrical syncytium, with tight electrical and mechanical connections between adjacent cardiac muscle cells. An action potential initiated in a specialized region of the heart (e.g., the sinoatrial node) is therefore able to pass quickly throughout the heart to facilitate synchronized contraction of the cardiac muscle cells, which is important for the pumping action of the heart. Likewise, refilling of the heart requires synchronized relaxation of the heart; abnormal relaxation often results in pathological conditions."

Cross-links Unlike linear flow charts or outlines, concept maps may contain cross-links that allow the reader to visualize complex relationships between ideas represented in different parts of the map (Fig. 1.13B) or between the map and other chapters in this book (Fig. 1.13C). Cross-links can, thus, identify concepts that are central to more than one topic in biochemistry, empowering students to be effective in clinical situations and on the United States Medical Licensure Examination (USMLE) or other examinations that require integration of material.

At physiologic pH, the \u03b1-carboxyl group is dissociated, forming the negatively charged carboxylate ion (\u2212COO\u2212), and the \u03b1-amino group is protonated (\u2212NH3+)."

Diagrams are often the best study aids, especially given the increasing number of questions requiring the interpretation of diagrams. Learn to apply basic physiologic relationships in a variety of ways (eg, the Fick equation, clearance equations). You are seldom asked to perform complex calculations. Hormones are the focus of many questions, so learn their sites of production and action as well as their regulatory mechanisms. A large portion of the physiology tested on the USMLE Step 1 is clinically relevant and involves understanding physiologic changes associated with pathologic processes (eg, changes in pulmonary function with COPD). Thus, it is worthwhile to review the physiologic changes that are found with common pathologies of the major organ systems (eg, heart, lungs, kidneys, GI tract) and endocrine glands."

The surprising power of mathematics comes from the length of the chains of reasoning that rigorous logic and mathematical arguments make possible, and from the unexpectedness of the conclusions that can be reached, often revealing connections that one would not otherwise have guessed at. Reversing the argument, mathematics provides a way to test experimental hypotheses: if mathematical reasoning from a given hypothesis leads to a prediction that is not true, then the hypothesis is not true."

Many books with lower ratings are well written and informative but are not ideal for boards preparation. We have not listed or commented on general textbooks available in the basic sciences. Evaluations are based on the cumulative results of formal and informal surveys of thousands of medical students at many medical schools across the country. The ratings represent a consensus opinion, but there may have been a broad range of opinion or limited student feedback on any particular resource. Please note that the data listed are subject to change in that: Publishers\u2019 prices change frequently. Bookstores often charge an additional markup."

            "content": "One way to study the chemistry of a single living cell is to insert the tip of a fine, glass, ionsensitive microelectrode directly into the cell interior through the plasma membrane. This technique is used to measure the intracellular concentrations of common inorganic ions, such as H+, Na+, K+, Cl\u2013, and Ca2+. However, ionsensitive microelectrodes reveal the ion concentration only at one point in a cell, and for an ion present at a very low concentration, such as Ca2+, their responses are slow and somewhat erratic. Thus, these microelectrodes are not ideally suited to record the rapid and transient changes in the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ that have an important role in allowing cells to respond to extracellular signals. Such changes can be analyzed with ion-sensitive indicators, whose light emission reflects the local concentration of the ion. Some of these indicators are luminescent (emitting light spontaneously), while others are fluorescent (emitting light on exposure to"
