As discussed above, a typical gene carries in its linear sequence of nucleotides the information for the linear sequence of the amino acids of a protein. Only about 1300 nucleotide pairs are required to encode a protein of average size (about 430 amino acids in humans). Most of the remaining sequence in a gene consists of long stretches of noncoding DNA that interrupt the relatively short segments of DNA that code for protein. As will be discussed in detail in Chapter 6, the coding sequences are called exons; the intervening (noncoding) sequences in genes are called introns (see Figure 4\u201315 and Table 4\u20131). The majority of human genes thus consist of a long string of alternating exons and introns, with most of the gene consisting of introns. In contrast, the majority of genes from organisms with concise genomes lack introns. This accounts for the much smaller size of their genes"

With the recent advances that have enabled the sequencing of entire human genomes cheaply and quickly, we can now identify such mutations and study their evolution and inheritance in ways that were impossible even a few years ago. By comparing the sequences of thousands of human genomes from all around the world, we can begin to identify directly the DNA differences that distinguish one individual from another. These differences hold clues to our evolutionary origins and can be used to explore the roots of disease. Linked Blocks of Polymorphisms Have Been Passed Down from Our Ancestors"

By revealing in this way the results of a very long natural \u201cexperiment,\u201d lasting for hundreds of millions of years, such comparative DNA sequencing studies have highlighted the most interesting regions in our genome. The comparisons reveal that roughly 5% of the human genome consists of \u201cmultispecies conserved sequences.\u201d To our great surprise, only about one-third of these sequences code for proteins (see Table 4\u20131, p. 184). Many of the remaining conserved sequences consist of DNA containing clusters of protein-binding sites that are involved in gene regulation, while others produce RNA molecules that are not translated into protein but are important for other known purposes. But, even in the most intensively studied species, the function of the majority of"

            "content": "3. Studies of the number of different RNAs suggest that, at any one time, a typical human cell expresses 30\u201360% of its approximately 30,000 genes at some level. There are about 21,000 protein-coding genes and a roughly estimated 9000 noncoding RNA genes in humans. When the patterns of RNA expression in different human cell lines are compared, the level of expression of almost every gene is found to vary from one cell type to another. A few of these differences are striking, like those of hemoglobin and tyrosine aminotransferase noted above, but most are much more subtle. But even those genes that are expressed in all cell types usually vary in their level of expression from one cell type to the next. 4."

            "content": "various lengths, it is possible to generate the tremendous diversity of primary protein structure. DNA length is normally measured in units of 1000 bp (kilobases, kb) or 1,000,000 bp (megabases, Mb). Not all DNA encodes genes. In fact, genes account for only ~10\u201315% of DNA. Much of the remaining DNA consists of sequences, often of highly repetitive nature, the function of which is poorly understood. These repetitive DNA regions, along with nonrepetitive sequences that do not encode genes, serve, in part, a structural role in the packaging of DNA into chromatin (i.e., DNA bound to histone proteins, and chromosomes) and exert regulatory functions (Fig. 82-1)."
