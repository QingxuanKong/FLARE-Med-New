    "predict": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. Step 1: Understand the given information - The disorder is X-linked recessive. - The disorder is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. - The incidence in males is 1 in 100. Step 2: Recall the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium equation The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences. The equation for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is: \\[ p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 \\] where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (in this case, the normal allele), q is the frequency of the recessive allele (the mutant allele), and 2pq is the frequency of heterozygotes (carriers). Step 3: Determine the frequency of the mutant allele (q) Since the disorder is X-linked recessive, only males can express the disorder. Therefore, the frequency of the mutant allele in the population is equal to the frequency of the disorder in males, which is 1 in 100 or 0.01. Step 4: Apply the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium equation \\[ p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 \\] \\[ 0.99 + 2(0.01)q + q^2 = 1 \\] \\[ q^2 + 0.02q - 0.01 = 0 \\] Step 5: Solve the quadratic equation for q Using the quadratic formula: \\[ q = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\] \\[ q = \\frac{-0.02 \\pm \\sqrt{0.02^2 - 4(1)(-0.01)}}{2(1)} \\] \\[ q = \\frac{-0.02 \\pm \\sqrt{0.0004 + 0.04}}{2} \\] \\[ q = \\frac{-0.02 \\pm \\sqrt{0.0404}}{2} \\] \\[ q = \\frac{-0.02 \\pm 0.2006}{2} \\] \\[ q = \\frac{-0.02 + 0.2006}{2} \\] or \\[ q = \\frac{-0.02 - 0.2006}{2} \\] \\[ q = 0.0903 \\] or \\[ q = -0.1103 \\] Since q represents the frequency of the mutant allele, it cannot be negative. Therefore, q = 0.0903. Step 6: Calculate the frequency of homozygous females The frequency of homozygous females is q^2, which is: \\[ q^2 = 0.0903^2 = 0.0082 \\] To convert this to a fraction, we get: \\[ q^2 = 0.0082 = \\frac{82}{10000} = \\frac{41}{5000} \\] Step 7: Convert the fraction to a decimal and round to the nearest whole number \\[ \\frac{41}{5000} = 0.0082 \\approx 0.008 \\approx \\frac{1}{125} \\] Therefore, the expected incidence of affected homozygous females is approximately 1 in 125. The final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we used the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium equation to determine the frequency of the mutant allele in the population. We then calculated the frequency of homozygous females, which is q^2. The final answer is approximately 1 in 125.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

A son inherits the Y chromosome from his father and one maternal X chromosome. Thus, the characteristic features of X-linked inheritance are (1) the absence of father-to-son transmission, and (2) the fact that all daughters of an affected male are obligate carriers of the mutant allele (Fig. 82-13C). The risk of developing disease due to a mutant X-chromosomal gene differs in the two sexes. Because males have only one X chromosome, they are hemizygous for the mutant allele; thus, they are more likely to develop the mutant phenotype, regardless of whether the mutation is dominant or recessive. A female may be either heterozygous or homozygous for the mutant allele, which may be dominant or recessive.

Because each individual has two copies of each chromosome (one inherited from the mother and one inherited from the father), he or she can have only two alleles at a given locus. However, there can be many different alleles in the population. The normal or common allele is usually referred to as wild type. When alleles at a given locus are identical, the individual is homozygous. Inheriting identical copies of a mutant allele occurs in many autosomal recessive disorders, particularly in circumstances of consanguinity or isolated populations. If the alleles are different on the maternal and the paternal copy of the gene, the individual is heterozygous at this locus (Fig. 82-10). If two different mutant alleles are inherited at a given locus, the individual is said to be a compound heterozygote. Hemizygous is used to describe males with a mutation in an X chromosomal gene or a female with a loss of one X chromosomal locus."

Most X-linked diseases are recessive. Common examples include color blindness, hemophilia A and B, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. Males with an X-linked recessive gene are usually afected by the disease it causes, because they lack a second X chromosome to express the normal dominant gene. A male with an X-linked disease cannot have afected sons because they cannot receive his X chromosome.

In the latter case, sex-linked inheritance becomes difficult to distinguish from dominant inheritance. Also, sex linkage is deceptive when a disease is lethal to one sex.

From 30% to 50% of carrier women with the fragile X mutation on one chromosome might show features of mild cognitive impairment or other behavioral disturbances. Approximately 20% develop features of premature reproductive failure (see below). The presence of symptoms in carrier females, albeit mild, is unusual for an X-linked recessive disease. Anticipation. This term refers to the phenomenon whereby clinical features of fragile X syndrome worsen with each successive generation, as if the mutation becomes increasingly deleterious as it is transmitted from a man to his grandsons and great-grandsons."

Greater than 90% of variants are single-base substitutions in the coding region that produce amino acid changes, which result in unstable proteins with reduced enzyme activity. As with most X-linked traits, males with one reference X chromosome and females with two reference X chromosomes will have equivalent \u201cnormal\u201d G6PD activity. Similarly, hemizygous-deficient males (with a deficient copy of the G6PD gene on their single X chromosome) and homozygous-deficient females (with two deficient copies) express reduced activity phenotypes (Table 5\u20131). However, for heterozygous females (with one deficient allele and one normal allele), genotype-to-phenotype predictions are less reliable due to the X-chromosome mosaicism, ie, where one X chromosome in each female cell is randomly inactivated, leading to G6PD activity that"

Linkage and association differ in several aspects. Genetic linkage is demonstrable in families or sibships. Association studies, on the other hand, compare a population of affected individuals with a control population. Association studies can be performed as case-control studies that include unrelated affected individuals and matched controls or as family-based studies that compare the frequencies of alleles transmitted or not transmitted to affected children."

Similarly, muscular dystrophy syndromes can be caused by mutations in various genes, consistent with the fact that it can be transmitted in an X-linked (Duchenne or Becker), autosomal dominant (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1), or autosomal recessive (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2) manner (Chap. 462e). Mutations in the X-linked DMD gene, which encodes dystrophin, are the most common cause of muscular dystrophy. This feature reflects the large size of the gene as well as the fact that the phenotype is expressed in hemizygous males because they have only a single copy of the X chromosome. Dystrophin is associated with a large protein complex linked to the membrane-associated cytoskeleton in muscle. Mutations in several different components of this protein complex can also cause muscular dystrophy syndromes. Although the phenotypic features of some of these disorders are distinct, the phenotypic spectrum"

Selected Monogenic (Mendelian) Disorders that a speciic disease phenotype can be caused by mutations in diferent genetic loci. It also explains why some diseases appear to follow more than one type of inheritance. An example is retinitis pigmentosa, which may develop following mutations in at least 35 diferent genes or loci and may result in autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked forms. Alelic heterogeneiy describes how diferent mutations of the same gene may afect presentation of a particular disease. For example, although only one gene has been associated with cystic ibrosis-the cystic ibrosis conductance transmembrane regulator gene-more than 2000 mutations in this gene have been described and result in variable disease severity (Chaps. 14 and 51, pp. 289 and 997)."

The rates for new mutations are calculated most readily for autosomal dominant and X-linked disorders and are ~10\u22125\u221210\u22126/locus per generation. Because most monogenic diseases are relatively rare, new mutations account for a significant fraction of cases. This is important in the context of genetic counseling, because a new mutation can be transmitted to the affected individual but does not necessarily imply that the parents are at risk to transmit the disease to other children. An exception to this is when the new mutation occurs early in germline development, leading to gonadal mosaicism."
