The common carotid arteries ascend in the neck to the C4 level, just below the angle of the jaw, where each divides into external and internal branches (sometimes the bifurcation is slightly above or below this point). This part of the extracerebral circulation is essential to an understanding of stroke. The carotid vessels are subject to atherosclerotic narrowing, atherothrombotic occlusion, arterial dissection and rarely, other processes such as various forms of vasculitis.

It gives off no branches in the neck and enters the cranial cavity through the carotid canal in the petrous part of the temporal bone. The internal carotid arteries supply the cerebral hemispheres, the eyes and the contents of the orbits, and the forehead. The external carotid arteries begin giving off branches immediately after the bifurcation of the common carotid arteries (Fig. 8.171 and Table 8.13) as follows: The superior thyroid artery is the first branch\u2014it arises from the anterior surface near or at the bifurcation and passes in a downward and forward direction to reach the superior pole of the thyroid gland. The ascending pharyngeal artery is the second and smallest branch\u2014it arises from the posterior aspect of the external carotid artery and ascends between the internal carotid artery and the pharynx."

            "content": "Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) with normal pulmonary artery pressures, as may occur with infective endocarditis, may produce an early systolic murmur. The murmur is soft (grade 1 or 2), is best heard at the lower left sternal border, and may increase in intensity with inspiration (Carvallo\u2019s sign). Regurgitant \u201cc-v\u201d waves may be visible in the jugular venous pulse. TR in this setting is not associated with signs of right heart failure. Mid-Systolic Murmurs Mid-systolic murmurs begin at a short interval after , end before S (Fig. 51e-1C), and are usually crescendo-decrescendo in configuration. Aortic stenosis is the most common cause of a mid-systolic murmur in an adult. The murmur of AS is usually loudest to the right of the sternum in the second intercostal space (aortic area, Fig. 51e-2) and radiates into the carotids. Transmission of the mid-systolic murmur to the apex, where it becomes higher-pitched, is common (Gallavardin effect; see above)."

At the initial examination, blood pressure should be measured in both arms and preferably in the supine, sitting, and standing positions to evaluate for postural hypotension. Even if the femoral pulse is normal to palpation, arterial pressure should be measured at least once in the lower extremity in patients in whom hypertension is discovered before age 30. Heart rate also should be recorded. Hypertensive individuals have an increased prevalence of atrial fibrillation. The neck should be palpated for an enlarged thyroid gland, and patients should be assessed for signs of hypoand hyperthyroidism. Examination of blood vessels may provide clues about underlying vascular disease and should include funduscopic examination, auscultation for bruits over the carotid and femoral arteries, and palpation of femoral and pedal pulses. The retina is the only tissue in which arteries and arterioles can be examined directly. With increasing"

            "content": "transection, injury to the carotid artery can result in carotid dissection, thrombosis, or pseudoa-neurysm formation. Carotid duplex ultrasound can be useful to locate the site of injury in the cervical segment of the carotid artery. Spiral CTA has become the modality of choice to detect extracranial carotid artery injury. Confirmation of carotid injury by contrast cerebral angiography remains the gold standard diagnostic test. Injuries to the cervical segment of the common and internal carotid arteries can be repaired surgically. Acute carotid artery thrombosis is usually treated medically with anti-coagulation if the patient is asymptomatic. Revascularization should be considered for patients presenting with ongoing cere-bral ischemia related to carotid artery thrombosis. Traumatic carotid artery dissection can cause cerebral ischemia due to thromboembolization, decreased flow, or thrombosis. Com-monly, the dissection involves the distal portion of the cervi-cal and petrous segment"

With a secure airway and adequate ventilation established, circulatory status is the next focus. An initial approximation of the patient\u2019s cardiovascular status can be obtained by palpating peripheral pulses. In gen-eral, systolic blood pressure (SBP) must be 60 mmHg for the carotid pulse to be palpable, 70 mmHg for the femoral pulse, and 80 mmHg for the radial pulse. Any episode of hypotension (defined as a SBP <90 mmHg) is assumed to be caused by hem-orrhage until proven otherwise. Patients with rapid massive blood loss may have paradoxical bradycardia.13 Blood pressure and pulse should be measured at least every 5 minutes in patients with significant blood loss until normal vital sign values are restored.Intravenous (IV) access for fluid resuscitation and medi-cation administration is obtained with two peripheral catheters, 16-gauge or larger in adults.
