    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze each option in relation to involuntary movements in the arm.\\n\\nOption A: Alcohol makes the tremor of benign essential tremor worse. This statement is not directly related to involuntary movements in the arm, but rather to the effect of alcohol on benign essential tremor. So, this option is not the correct answer.\\n\\nOption B: Hemiballismus is due to a stroke causing paralysis of the distal half of the arm. Hemiballismus is a disorder characterized by involuntary, violent, and unpredictable movements of the limbs, but it is not specifically related to paralysis of the distal half of the arm. The correct diagnosis for hemiballismus is a lesion in the subthalamic nucleus, not a stroke affecting the distal half of the arm. So, this option is not the correct answer.\\n\\nOption C: A'milkmaid' grip is sometimes found in dystonia. This option is correct. The'milkmaid' grip is a characteristic hand posture found in dystonia, where the hand is clenched into a fist with the thumb on top of the fingers. This is a classic sign of dystonia, a disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that can cause repetitive movements or abnormal postures.\\n\\nOption D: Writer's cramp is an example of a focal dystonia. Writer's cramp is a type of focal dystonia that affects the hand and is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause spasms or cramps while writing or performing other fine motor tasks. However, writer's cramp is typically a focal dystonia that affects the hand, whereas the question asks about involuntary movements in the arm. So, this option is not the correct answer.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. A'milkmaid' grip is sometimes found in dystonia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

Thus, after strongly flexing one arm against a resistance that is suddenly released, the patient may be unable to check the flexion movement, to the point where the arm may strike the face. This is the result of a delay in contraction of the triceps muscle, which ordinarily would arrest overflexion of the arm. Stewart and Holmes, who first described this test, made the point that when resistance to flexion is suddenly removed, the normal limb moves only a short distance in flexion and then rebounds very briefly in the opposite direction. Thus, although the two are often conflated, there is a subtle difference between the signs of deficient checking and an excessive rebound of the limb that follows."

Mirror movements are also a feature of Parkinson disease and of lesions in the upper cervical spinal cord. In some patients, as they recover from hemiplegia, a variety of movement abnormalities emerge, such as tremor, athetosis, and chorea on the affected side. These are expressions of damage to basal ganglionic and thalamic structures and are discussed in Chap. 4."

Sometimes a series of clonic movements of increasing frequency build up to a tonic contraction. The characteristic feature is that the movements spread (march) from the part first affected to other contiguous muscles on the same side of the body. In its typical form, the seizure spreads from the hand, up the arm, to the face, and down the leg; or if the first movement is in the foot, the seizure marches up the leg, down the arm, and to the face, usually in a matter of 20 to 30 s. Rarely, the first muscular contraction is in the abdomen, thorax, or neck. In some cases, the one-sided seizure activity is followed by turning of the head and eyes to the convulsing side, occasionally to the opposite side, and then by a generalized seizure with loss of consciousness.

Thus epilepsia partialis continua is, in effect, a highly restricted and very persistent focal motor status epilepticus. The distal muscles of the leg and arm, especially the flexors of the hand and fingers, are affected more frequently than the proximal ones. In the face, the recurrent contractions involve either the corner of the mouth or one or both eyelids. Occasionally, isolated muscles of the neck or trunk are affected on one side. The clonic activity may be accentuated by active or passive movement of the involved muscles and may be reduced in severity but not abolished during sleep."

In the absence of volition, the hand and arm undertake complex and seemingly purposeful movements such as reaching into a pocket or handbag, placing the hand behind the head, tugging on the opposite hand or other body part, and rebuttoning the shirt immediately after it has been unbuttoned by the other hand. These activities may occur even during sleep. The patient is aware of the movements but has the sense that the actions are beyond his control and there is often an impression that the hand is estranged, as if commanded by an external agent (although the limb is recognized as one\u2019s own\u2014there is no anosognosia); a grasp reflex and a tendency to grope are usually present.

There is decreased voluntary drive on spinal motor neurons (fewer motor units are recruitable and their firing rates are slower), resulting in a slowness of movement. There is also an increased degree of cocontraction of antagonistic muscles, reflected in a decreased rate of rapid alternating movements. These abnormalities probably account for the greater sense of effort and the manifest fatigability in effecting voluntary movement of the weakened muscles. Another phenomenon is the activation of paralyzed muscles as parts of certain automatisms (synkinesias). For example, the paralyzed arm may move suddenly during yawning and stretching. Attempts by the patient to move the hemiplegic limbs may also result in a variety of associated movements. Thus, flexion of the arm may result in involuntary pronation and flexion of the leg or in dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot. Also, volitional"

The rhythmic beat coincides with an alternating burst of activity in agonist and antagonist muscles in the electromyogram (EMG) and sometimes palpable by the examiner; hence, the description alternating tremor is applied. The arm, jaw, tongue, eyelids, and foot are less often involved. Even the least degree of tremor is felt during passive movement of a rigid part (cogwheel phenomenon, or Negro sign, or at least this is the ostensible explanation for cogwheeling but there has been a dissociation of these two signs in many of our patients). The tremor shows surprising fluctuations in severity and is aggravated by walking and excitement, but its frequency remains constant (Hunker and Abbs). It bears repetition that one side of the body is typically involved before the other with tremor and rigidity, and the tremor in particular remains asymmetrical as the illness advances."

The tremor is most often localized in one or both hands and forearms and less frequently in the feet, jaw, lips, or tongue (Fig. 4-7D). It occurs when the limb is in an attitude of repose and is suppressed or diminished by willed movement, at least momentarily, only to reassert itself once the limb assumes a new position. Even though it is termed a \u201cresting\u201d tremor, maintaining the arm in an attitude of repose requires a certain degree of muscular contraction, albeit slight. If the tremulous hand is completely relaxed, as it is when the arm is fully supported at the wrist and elbow, the tremor usually disappears. It is difficult, however, for the parkinsonian patient to relax and instead it is typical to maintain a state of slight tonic contraction of the trunk and proximal muscles."

For example, even a simple reaching movement of the arm may require coactivation of axial muscles and possibly muscles in the lower extremity to maintain posture and balance, which themselves may be monitored by up to three different sensory systems (vision, vestibular, and proprioceptive) whose information has to be integrated. Furthermore, movements can alter the internal environment and thus can require compensatory changes in heart and breathing rates, blood vessel diameters, and other internal processes. All these variables are monitored and controlled by various specialized subsystems of the nervous system, all of which must work together for the organism to perform movements and more generally to survive. The succeeding chapters will describe these major subsystems individually; however, it should be remembered that in reality their activity is integrated to generate normal behavior."

A conventional test for hypotonia is to tap the wrists of the outstretched arms and to detect a displacement through a wider range than normal in the affected limb (or both limbs in diffuse cerebellar disease), sometimes causing the limb to oscillate; this is presumably the result of a failure of the hypotonic muscles to fixate the arm at the shoulder. Another test for hypotonia is to shake the affected limb and demonstrate that the flapping movements of the hand are of wider excursion than normal. If the patient places his elbows on the table with the arms flexed and the hands are allowed to hang limply, the hand of the hypotonic limb will sag.

The term ataxic is a suitable substitute for intention, because this tremor is always combined with cerebellar ataxia and adds to it. Its salient feature is that it requires for its full expression the performance of an exacting, precise, projected movement. The tremor is absent both when the limbs are inactive and during the first part of a voluntary movement, but as the action continues and fine adjustments of the movement are demanded (e.g., in touching the tip of the nose or the examiner\u2019s finger), an irregular interruption of forward progression appears.

These muscles allow the eye to rotate about three axes. Assuming that the head is in an upright position, the axes are the vertical axis, a horizontal axis that runs left to right, and the torsional axis (which is directed along the axis of sight). The medial and lateral recti control movement about the vertical axis; the other four muscles generate movement about the horizontal and torsional axes.

As the descending axons subserving limb and facial movements emerge from the cortical motor strip, they maintain the anatomic organization of the overlying cortex; therefore, a discrete cortical\u2013subcortical lesion will result in a restricted weakness of the hand and arm or the foot and leg. More caudally, the descending motor fibers converge and are collected in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, so that even a small lesion there will cause a \u201cpure motor hemiplegia,\u201d in which the face, arm, hand, leg, and foot are affected to more or less the same degree (see Lacunar syndromes in Chap. 33). The axons subserving facial movement are situated anterior in the posterior limb of the capsule, those for hand and arm in the central portion and those for the foot and leg, posteriorly (as detailed by Brodal)."

Sometimes the foot is plantarflexed at the ankle and the weight is carried on the toes; or the foot may be dorsiflexed or inverted. An involuntary movement may cause the leg to be suspended in the air momentarily, imparting a lilting or waltzing character to the gait, or it may twist the trunk so violently that the patient may fall."

The monkey first captures the central light spot and then captures whichever of the surrounding targets that becomes illuminated. B, Raster plots showing the activity of one motor cortex cell during movement in eight different directions. T indicates the time at which the target light turns on, whereas M indicates the time at the onset of movement, which is at the center of each raster. Each mark on a raster represents a spike of a motor cortex cell, and each row of marks shows the cell\u2019s activity during one trial. C, Cosine function was fit to the firing level as a function of the direction of movement. The horizontal bar indicates the average spontaneous firing rate in the absence of an upcoming movement. Note that for most directions, the activity in the periods just before and during movement changed significantly from baseline."

Or, spells of weakness or involuntary movement of a hand or arm or dimness of vision, lasting 5 to 10 min, occur spontaneously or are brought on by standing or walking. Each of the partial attacks may reproduce the profile of the stroke in miniature. In other words, the principle of intermittency seems to characterize the thrombotic process."

            "content": "Normally, deceleration of movement is smooth and accurate, even if sharp changes in the direction of a limb are demanded, as in following a moving target. With cerebellar disease, the velocity and force of the movement are not checked in the normal manner. The excursion of the limb may be arrested prematurely, and the target is then reached by a series of jerky movements. In contrast, the limb may overshoot the mark (hypermetria) because of delayed activation and diminished contraction of antagonist muscles; then the error is corrected by a series of secondary movements in which the finger or toe sways around the target before coming to rest, or moves from side to side a few times on the target itself. This side-to-side movement of the finger as it approaches its mark tends to assume a rhythmic quality; it has traditionally been referred to as intention tremor, or ataxic tremor. The tremor is mainly perpendicular to the trajectory of movement and mostly in the horizontal plane (the"

The tonic neck reflex consisting of extension of the arm and leg on the side to which the head is passively turned and flexion of the opposite limbs, if obligatory and sustained, is a sign at any age of pyramidal or extrapyramidal motor abnormality. Barlow reports that he has obtained this reflex in 25 percent of developmentally delayed infants at 9 to 10 months of age. Fragments of the reflex, such as a brief extension of one arm, may be elicited in 60 percent of normal infants at 1 to 2 months of age and may be adopted spontaneously by the infant up to 6 months of age. As with the Moro response, persistence beyond this age represents a malfunction of the nervous system. 3. The placing reaction in which the foot or hand, brought into contact with the edge of a table, is lifted automatically and placed on the flat surface, is present in all normal newborns. Its absence or asymmetry in infants younger than 6 months of age indicates a motor abnormality. 4."
