Mercury sphygmomanometers use the principle of mercury columns to measure blood pressure, while aneroid sphygmomanometers use a mechanical mechanism to measure blood pressure. The smallest increments on these devices are determined by the sensitivity of their measuring mechanisms. Mercury sphygmomanometers typically have a smallest increment of 1 mmHg, while aneroid sphygmomanometers have a smallest increment of 2 mmHg. This is because aneroid sphygmomanometers rely on a mechanical mechanism that measures pressure changes in a fluid-filled capsule, which can only detect changes in pressure in increments of 2 mmHg. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 2 mmHg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Proper training of observers, positioning of the patient, and selection of cuff size are essential. Owing to recent regulations preventing the use of mercury because of concerns about its potential toxicity, most office measurements are made with aneroid sphygmomanometers or with oscillometric devices. These instruments should be calibrated periodically, and their accuracy confirmed. Before the blood pressure measurement is taken, the individual should be seated quietly in a chair (not the exam table) with feet on the floor for 5 min in a private, quiet setting with a comfortable room temperature. At least two measurements should be made.

In hospital intensive care units, needles or catheters may be introduced into the peripheral arteries of patients to measure arterial blood pressure directly by means of strain gauges. When blood pressure readings are taken from the arm, systolic pressure may be estimated by palpation of the radial artery at the wrist (palpatory method). While pressure in the cuff exceeds the systolic level, no pulse is perceived. As pressure falls just below the systolic level ( Fig. 17.20A ), a spurt of blood passes through the brachial artery under the cuff during the peak of systole, and a slight pulse is felt at the wrist."

The sphygmomanometer is a device that inflates a cuff around the midportion of the arm to compress the brachial artery against the humerus. The cuff is inflated so it exceeds the systolic blood pressure (greater than 120 mm Hg). The clinician places a stethoscope over the brachial artery in the cubital fossa and listens (auscultates) for the pulse. As the pressure in the arm cuff of the sphygmomanometer is reduced just below the level of the systolic blood pressure, the pulse becomes audible as a regular thumping sound. As the pressure in the sphygmomanometer continues to drop, the regular thumping sound becomes clearer. When the pressure in the sphygmomanometer is less than that of the diastolic blood pressure, the audible thumping sound becomes inaudible.

Biparietal diameter and head circumference measurements are dependent on the plane of section and may also be afected by deformative pressures on the skull. Last, abdominal circumference measurements are more variable. However, these are most frequently abnormal with fetal-growth restriction because soft tissue predominates in this dimension (Fig. 44-6).

In the United States, average systolic blood pressure is higher for men than for women during early adulthood, although among older individuals the age-related rate of rise is steeper for women. Consequently, among individuals age 60 and older, systolic blood pressures of women are higher than those of men. Among adults, diastolic blood pressure also increases progressively with age until ~55 years, after which it tends to"

Evaluation of patients with resistant hypertension might include home blood pressure monitoring to determine if office blood pressures are representative of the usual blood pressure. A more extensive evaluation for a secondary form of hypertension should be undertaken if no other explanation for hypertension resistance becomes apparent."

Unfortunately, this approach is neither accurate nor reliable. Other methods, however, can be used to reliably detect the reappearance of a pulse distal to the cuff and thereby estimate systolic blood pressure. Two excellent and widely available approaches for pulse detection are use of a Doppler stethoscope (reappearance of the pulse produces an audible amplified signal) or a pulse oximeter (reappearance of the pulse is indicated by flashing of a light-emitting diode).A number of automated devices are capable of repeti-tively measuring blood pressure noninvasively. Some of these devices measure pressure oscillations in the inflatable bladder encircling the extremity to detect arterial pulsations as pressure in the cuff is gradually lowered from greater than systolic to less than diastolic pressure. Other automated"
