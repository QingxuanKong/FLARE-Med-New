The repeats are sometimes located within the coding region of the genes, as in Huntington\u2019s disease or the X-linked form of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA; Kennedy\u2019s syndrome). In other instances, the repeats probably alter gene regulatory sequences. If an expansion is present, the DNA fragment is unstable and tends to expand further during cell division. The length of the nucleotide repeat often correlates with the severity of the disease. When repeat length increases from one generation to the next, disease manifestations may worsen or be observed at an earlier age; this phenomenon is referred to as anticipation.

Although the specific nucleotide sequence that undergoes amplification varies with different disorders, all affected sequences share the nucleotides guanine (G) and cytosine (C). For example, in fragile X syndrome, prototypical of this category of disorders, there are 200 to 4000 tandem repeats of the sequence CGG within a gene called FMR1. In normal populations, the number of repeats is small, averaging 29. The expansions of the trinucleotide sequences prevent normal expression of the FMR1 gene, thus giving rise to mental retardation. Another distinguishing feature of trinucleotide repeat mutations is that they are dynamic (i.e., the degree of amplification increases during gametogenesis).

Mechanistically, the expansion is thought to be caused by unequal recombination and slipped mispairing. A premutation represents a small increase in trinucleotide copy number. In subsequent generations, the expanded repeat may increase further in length and result in an increasingly severe phenotype, a process called dynamic mutation (see below for discussion of anticipation). Trinucleotide expansion was first recognized as a cause of the fragile X syndrome, one of the most common causes of intellectual disability. Other disorders arising from a similar mechanism include Huntington\u2019s disease (Chap. 448), X-linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy (Chap. 452), and myotonic dystrophy (Chap. 462e). Malignant cells are also characterized by genetic instability, indicating a breakdown in mechanisms that regulate DNA repair and the cell cycle."

Trinucleotide repeat expansion: Occasionally, a sequence of three bases that is repeated in tandem will become amplified in number so that too many copies of the triplet occur. If this happens within the coding region of a gene, the protein will contain many extra copies of one amino acid. For example, expansion of the CAG codon in exon 1 of the gene for huntingtin protein leads to the insertion of many extra glutamine residues in the protein, causing the neurodegenerative disorder Huntington disease (Fig. 32.4). The additional glutamines result in an abnormally long protein that is cleaved, producing toxic fragments that aggregate in neurons. If the trinucleotide repeat expansion occurs in an untranslated region (UTR) of a gene, the result can be a decrease in the amount of protein produced, as seen in fragile X syndrome and myotonic dystrophy.

As noted, earlier many other neurodegenerative diseases related to trinucleotide repeat expansions are recognized. Some general principles follow: In all cases, gene functions are altered by an expansion of the repeats, but the precise threshold at which premutations are converted to full mutations differs with each disorder. Whereas the expansion in fragile X syndrome occurs during oogenesis, in other disorders such as Huntington disease, premutations are converted to full mutations during spermatogenesis. The expansion may involve any part of the gene, and the range of possibilities can be divided into two broad categories: those that affect untranslated regions (as in fragile X syndrome) and those that affect coding regions (as in Huntington disease) ("

There is a strong genotype-phenotype correlation, with larger numbers of repeats resulting in earlier-onset disease.

Further expansions of the CAG (glutamine-encoding) repeats occur during spermatogenesis, so paternal transmission may be associated with earlier onset in the next generation, a phenomenon referred to as anticipation (Chapter 7).

            "content": "2.6. Translation of a synthetic polyribonucleotide containing the repeating sequence CAA in a cell-free protein-synthesizing system produces three homopolypeptides: polyglutamine, polyasparagine, and polythreonine. If the codons for glutamine and asparagine are CAA and AAC, respectively, which of the following triplets is the codon for threonine? A. AAC B. ACA C. CAA D. CAC E. CCA Correct answer = B. The synthetic polynucleotide sequence of CAACAACAACAA \u2026 could be read by the in vitro protein-synthesizing system starting at the first C, the first A, or the second A (that is, in any one of three reading frames). In the first case, the first triplet codon would be CAA, which codes glutamine; in the second case, the first triplet codon would be AAC, which codes for asparagine; in the last case, the first triplet codon would be ACA, which codes for threonine. 2.7. Which of the following is required for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein synthesis?"

            "content": "A group of rare inherited conditions that can mimic HD, designated HD-like (HDL) disorders, have also been identified. HDL-1, -2, and -4 are autosomal dominant conditions that typically present in adulthood. HDL-1 is due to expansion of an octapeptide repeat in PRNP, the gene encoding the prion protein (Chap. 453e). Thus HDL-1 is properly considered a prion disease. Patients exhibit onset of personality change in the third or fourth decade, followed by chorea, rigidity, myoclonus, ataxia, and epilepsy. HDL-2 manifests in the third or fourth decade with a variety of movement disorders, including chorea, dystonia, or parkinsonism and dementia. Most patients are of African descent. Acanthocytosis can sometimes be seen in these patients, and this condition must be distinguished from neuroacanthocytosis. HDL-2 is caused by an abnormally expanded CTG/ CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the junctophilin-3 (JPH3) gene. The pathology of HDL-2 consists of intranuclear inclusions"
