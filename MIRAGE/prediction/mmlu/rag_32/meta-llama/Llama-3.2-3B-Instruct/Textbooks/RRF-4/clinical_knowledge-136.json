According to the provided documents, arm reflexes include the biceps, brachioradialis, and triceps reflexes. The root value of the biceps reflex is indeed C5-C6, which corresponds to option A. Option B is incorrect because if no reflex is elicited when tapping a tendon, it is documented as absent, not just documented as absent. Option C is incorrect because the triceps tendon is struck in the posterior aspect of the elbow, not the antecubital fossa. Option D is incorrect because brisk finger jerks confirm an upper motor neuron lesion, not a lower motor neuron lesion. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The patient should be relaxed and the muscle positioned midway between full contraction and extension. Reflexes may be enhanced by asking the patient to voluntarily contract other, distant muscle groups (Jendrassik maneuver). For example, upper limb reflexes may be reinforced by voluntary teeth-clenching, and the Achilles reflex by hooking the flexed fingers of the two hands together and attempting to pull them apart. For each reflex tested, the two sides should be tested sequentially, and it is important to determine the smallest stimulus required to elicit a reflex rather than the maximum response. Reflexes are graded according to the following scale:"

The tonic neck reflex consisting of extension of the arm and leg on the side to which the head is passively turned and flexion of the opposite limbs, if obligatory and sustained, is a sign at any age of pyramidal or extrapyramidal motor abnormality. Barlow reports that he has obtained this reflex in 25 percent of developmentally delayed infants at 9 to 10 months of age. Fragments of the reflex, such as a brief extension of one arm, may be elicited in 60 percent of normal infants at 1 to 2 months of age and may be adopted spontaneously by the infant up to 6 months of age. As with the Moro response, persistence beyond this age represents a malfunction of the nervous system. 3. The placing reaction in which the foot or hand, brought into contact with the edge of a table, is lifted automatically and placed on the flat surface, is present in all normal newborns. Its absence or asymmetry in infants younger than 6 months of age indicates a motor abnormality. 4."

Thus, after strongly flexing one arm against a resistance that is suddenly released, the patient may be unable to check the flexion movement, to the point where the arm may strike the face. This is the result of a delay in contraction of the triceps muscle, which ordinarily would arrest overflexion of the arm. Stewart and Holmes, who first described this test, made the point that when resistance to flexion is suddenly removed, the normal limb moves only a short distance in flexion and then rebounds very briefly in the opposite direction. Thus, although the two are often conflated, there is a subtle difference between the signs of deficient checking and an excessive rebound of the limb that follows."

Testing of Sensory Function Because this part of the examination is attainable only through the subjective responses of the patient, it requires considerable cooperation. At the same time, it is subject to overinterpretation and suggestibility. Usually, sensory testing is reserved for the end of the examination and, if the findings are to be reliable, should not be prolonged. Each test should be explained briefly; too much discussion with a meticulous, introspective patient encourages the reporting of meaningless minor variations of stimulus intensity."

The strength of the legs can be tested with the patient prone and the knees flexed and observing downward drift of the weakened leg.

For example, even a simple reaching movement of the arm may require coactivation of axial muscles and possibly muscles in the lower extremity to maintain posture and balance, which themselves may be monitored by up to three different sensory systems (vision, vestibular, and proprioceptive) whose information has to be integrated. Furthermore, movements can alter the internal environment and thus can require compensatory changes in heart and breathing rates, blood vessel diameters, and other internal processes. All these variables are monitored and controlled by various specialized subsystems of the nervous system, all of which must work together for the organism to perform movements and more generally to survive.

Function is rarely if ever restored after the slow evolution of spasticity; however, the use of botulinum toxin may help considerably in relieving the spasticity. Conversely, the early development of spasticity in the arm or the early appearance of a grasp reflex may presage a favorable outcome.

            "content": "Vasoconstriction induces an elevation of the blood pressure. This is the basis of the cold pressor test. In normal persons, immersing one hand in ice water for 1 to 5 min raises the systolic pressure by 15 to 20 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure by 10 to 15 mm Hg. Similarly, the sustained isometric contraction of a group of muscles (e.g., those of the forearm in handgrip) for 5 min normally increases the heart rate and the systolic and diastolic pressures by at least 15 mm Hg. The response in both of these tests is reduced or absent with lesions of the sympathetic reflex arc, particularly of the efferent limb, but neither of these tests has been well quantitated or validated. The stress involved in doing mental arithmetic in noisy and distracting surroundings will also stimulate a mild but measurable increase in pulse rate and blood pressure. Obviously this response does not depend on the afferent limb of the sympathetic reflex arc and must be mediated by cortical\u2013hypothalamic"

            "content": "Spasticity, Hyperreflexia, and the Babinski Sign The identifying characteristics of paralysis from an upper motor neuron lesion are a predilection for involvement of certain muscle groups, a specific pattern of response of muscles to passive stretch (where resistance increases linearly in relation to velocity of stretch), and a manifest exaggeration of tendon reflexes. The antigravity muscles\u2014the flexors of the arms and the extensors of the legs\u2014are predominantly affected. The arm tends to assume a flexed and pronated position and the leg an extended and adducted one, indicating that certain spinal neurons are reflexly more active than others."
