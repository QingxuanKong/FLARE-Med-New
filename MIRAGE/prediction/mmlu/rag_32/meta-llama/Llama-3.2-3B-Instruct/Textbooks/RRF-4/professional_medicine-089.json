Acne may begin as early as 8 years of age and may continue into adulthood. Acne primarily affects areas with increased sebaceous glanddensity, such as the face, upper chest, and back. Superficialplugging of the pilosebaceous unit results in noninflammatorysmall (1to 2-mm) open (blackhead) and closed (whitehead) comedones. An open comedo is less likely to become inflammatory than a closed comedo. Rupture of a comedo into adjacent dermis and proliferation of P. acnes induce an inflammatory response and development of inflammatory papules and pustules. Larger, skin-colored or red cysts and nodulesrepresent deeper plugging and cystic acne. Increased and persistent inflammation, especially with rupture of a deep cyst,increases the risk of scarring."

In boys both the membranous and cartilaginous portions of the vocal cords lengthen much more than they do in girls, accounting for deepening of the voice. Comedones, acne, and seborrhea of the scalp begin because of increased secretion of adrenal and gonadal steroids at puberty. In general, early-onset acne correlates with the development of severe acne later in puberty. The appearance of comedones in the nasal creases and behind the pinna may be the first indications of impending pubertal development."

Acne vulgaris is a self-limited disorder primarily of teenagers and young adults, although perhaps 10\u201320% of adults may continue to experience some form of the disorder. The permissive factor for the expression of the disease in adolescence is the increase in sebum production by sebaceous glands after puberty. Small cysts, called comedones, form in hair follicles due to blockage of the follicular orifice by retention of keratinous material and sebum. The activity of bacteria (Propionibacterium acnes) within the comedones releases free fatty acids from sebum, causes inflammation within the cyst, and results in rupture of the cyst wall. An inflammatory foreign-body reaction develops as result of extrusion of oily and keratinous debris from the cyst."

The primary event in all acne lesions is the development of the micro-comedo, which results from the obstruction of the hair follicle with keratin, increased sebum production from sebaceous glands, and overgrowth of normal skin flora, leading to pilosebaceous occlusion and enlargement. Androgens are a potent stimulus of the sebaceous gland. The subsequent inflammatory component and pustule formation results from proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes, a commensal organism of the skin. The pathogenesis of acne thus involves three components: increased sebum production, hyperkeratosis, and bacterial proliferation. Effective treatment focuses on minimizing these factors."

Gonadarche is characterized by increasing secretion of gonadal sex steroids as a result of the maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. These sex steroids differ by gender, consisting of testosterone from the testes and estradiol and progesterone from the ovaries. In males physical signs are pubic hair, axillary hair, facial hair, increased muscularity, deeper voice, increased penile size, and increased testicular volume. In females the physical signs are breast development, development of the female body habitus, increased size of the uterus, and menarche with regular menstrual cycles.

Anecdotal photographs and data such as these served to provide the basis for the theory that body fat, body mass, and menarche are linked. (From Wilkins L. The diagnosis and treatment of endocrine disorders in childhood and adolescence. 3rd ed. Springfield, IL: Charles C Thomas, 1965, with permission.) development, and Montgomery\u2019s glands are visible around the circumference of the areola. The nipple is generally below the midplane of breast tissue when the woman is seated and viewed from the side. Full breast development usually occurs over 3 to 3.5 years, but it may occur in as little as 2 years or not progress beyond stage 4 until the first pregnancy. Breast size is no indication of breast maturity."

Basal levels of LH tend to be elevated in most affected individuals, and androgen production is invariably increased, even though circulating levels of androgens may be near the upper limits of the normal range in many affected women. Figure 29.21 Typical facial hirsutism in three women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. A: 25-year-old. 4. In anovulatory women, estrone levels are typically greater than estradiol levels. 5. Because circulating levels of estrogens are not diminished in PCOS and androgen levels are only mildly elevated, affected girls become both feminized and masculinized at puberty. This is an important feature because girls with classic forms of CAH who do not experience precocious puberty (and even those who do) only become masculinized at puberty (i.e., they do not develop breasts). 6."

Affected individuals typically present with breast development (usually only to Tanner stage 3) out of proportion with the amount of pubic and axillary hair present (Fig. 29.15). In this disorder, 46,XY individuals have bilateral testes, female external genitalia, a blindly ending vagina (often foreshortened and sometimes absent), and no m\u00a8ullerian derivatives (i.e., uterus and fallopian tubes) (64). Infrequently, patients may have clitoral enlargement and labioscrotal fusion at puberty, which is referred to as incomplete androgen insensitivity."

More recent studies led to recommendations that girls be evaluated for precocious puberty if breast development or pubic hair is present at <7 years of age for white girls or <6 years for black girls."
