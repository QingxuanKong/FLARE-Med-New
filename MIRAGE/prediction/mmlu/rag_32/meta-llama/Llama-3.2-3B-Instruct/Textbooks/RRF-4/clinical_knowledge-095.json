The correct approach involves a combination of visual inspection, auditory evaluation, and tactile assessment. Option C, which suggests looking for chest movements, listening for breath sounds, and feeling for exhaled air on your cheek, is the most comprehensive and accurate method. This approach allows the healthcare provider to evaluate the patient's respiratory status in a thorough and objective manner. Option A, removing dentures, is not a relevant step in assessing breathing. Option B, using a mirror to check for exhaled air, may not be effective in all situations, as it may not accurately detect all types of breathing abnormalities. Option D, assessing for 30 seconds, is not a specific or reliable method for evaluating breathing. Therefore, the correct answer is C, which provides a systematic and evidence-based approach to assessing a patient's breathing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Several studies have shown that daily spontaneous breathing trials can identify patients who are ready for extubation. Accordingly, all intubated, mechanically ventilated patients should undergo daily screening of respiratory function. If oxygenation is stable (i.e., PaO2/FIO2 [partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen] >200 and PEEP \u22645 cmH2O), cough and airway reflexes are intact, and no vasopressor agents or sedatives are being administered, the patient has passed the screening test and should undergo a spontaneous breathing trial.

In fact, the blood pH, which has a profound effect on the drive to breathe, can be assessed only by such sampling.

When volume-controlled modes of mechanical ventilation are used, accompanying airway pressures can easily be measured as long as the patient is passive. The peak airway pressure is determined by two variables: airway resistance and respiratory system compliance. At the end of inspiration, inspiratory flow can be stopped transiently. This end-inspiratory pause (plateau pressure) is a static measurement, affected only by respiratory system compliance and not by airway resistance. Therefore, during volume-controlled ventilation, the difference between the peak (airway resistance + respiratory system compliance) and plateau (respiratory system compliance only) airway pressures provides a quantitative assessment of airway resistance.

Evidence of increased work of breathing (supraclavicular retractions; use of accessory muscles of ventilation; and the tripod position, characterized by sitting with the hands braced on the knees) is indicative of increased airway resistance or stiffness of the lungs and the chest wall. When measuring the vital signs, the physician should accurately assess the respiratory rate and measure the pulsus paradoxus (Chap. 288); if the systolic pressure decreases by >10 mmHg, the presence of COPD, acute asthma, or pericardial disease should be considered.

Percussion of the chest is used to establish diaphragm excursion and lung size. In the setting of decreased breath sounds, percussion is used to distinguish between pleural effusions (dull to percussion) and pneumothorax (hyper-resonant note). The role of palpation is limited in the respiratory examination. Palpation can demonstrate subcutaneous air in the setting of barotrauma. It can also be used as an adjunctive assessment to determine whether an area of decreased breath sounds is due to consolidation (increased tactile fremitus) or a pleural effusion (decreased tactile fremitus)."

The patient then inhales maximally and exhales forcefully and completely, and the volume of exhaled air is measured. The total volume of exhaled air, from a maximal inspiration to a maximal exhalation, is the vital capacity (VC). Residual volume (RV) is the air remaining in the lungs after a complete exhalation.

            "content": "Chronic respiratory alkalosis is the most common acid-base disturbance in critically ill patients and, when severe, portends a poor prognosis. Many cardiopulmonary disorders manifest respiratory alkalosis 324 in their early to intermediate stages, and the finding of normocapnia and hypoxemia in a patient with hyperventilation may herald the onset of rapid respiratory failure and should prompt an assessment to determine if the patient is becoming fatigued. Respiratory alkalosis is common during mechanical ventilation. The hyperventilation syndrome may be disabling. Paresthesia; circumoral numbness; chest wall tightness or pain; dizziness; inability to take an adequate breath; and, rarely, tetany may be sufficiently stressful to perpetuate the disorder. Arterial blood-gas analysis demonstrates an acute or chronic respiratory alkalosis, often with hypocapnia in the range of 15\u201330 mmHg and no hypoxemia. CNS diseases or injury can produce several patterns of hyperventilation and sustained"

Noninvasive mechanical ventilation may be considered initially in lieu of endotracheal intubation but is generally insufficient in patients with severe bulbar weakness or ventilatory failure with hypercarbia. Principles of mechanical ventilation are discussed in Chap. 323."

The best respiratory care is achieved when the patient is able to deliver an effective cough to clear secre-tions and results from the commitment and proper training of all involved healthcare providers. The process begins preopera-tively, with clear instructions on using pillows (or other support techniques) over the wound and then applying pressure.Postoperatively, proper pain control without oversedation (as outlined earlier) is essential. Daily morning rounds should include a careful assessment of the patient\u2019s pulmonary status, reminders to the patient and family about the importance of coughing and deep breathing, including use of adjunctive respi-ratory equipment if ordered, and mobilization of the patient.
