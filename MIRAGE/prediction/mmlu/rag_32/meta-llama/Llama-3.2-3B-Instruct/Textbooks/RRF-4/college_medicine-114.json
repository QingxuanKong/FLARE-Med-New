This indicates that she experiences gender dysphoria, which is a discrepancy between her assigned sex at birth and her experienced gender.\\n\\nGiven that she is sexually active with females only, it suggests that her sexual orientation is homosexual.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is that this individual is transgender and homosexual.\\n\\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\\nOption A: Cis-gender, heterosexual - This is incorrect because the individual identifies as a female, which means she is not cis-gender.\\nOption B: Transgender, heterosexual - This is incorrect because the individual's sexual orientation is homosexual, not heterosexual.\\nOption C: Cis-gender, homosexual - This is incorrect because the individual identifies as a female, which means she is not cis-gender.\\nOption D: Transgender, homosexual - This is the correct answer because the individual identifies as a female and has a homosexual sexual orientation.\\n\\nSo, the correct answer is D.
