A son inherits the Y chromosome from his father and one maternal X chromosome. Thus, the characteristic features of X-linked inheritance are (1) the absence of father-to-son transmission, and (2) the fact that all daughters of an affected male are obligate carriers of the mutant allele (Fig. 82-13C). The risk of developing disease due to a mutant X-chromosomal gene differs in the two sexes. Because males have only one X chromosome, they are hemizygous for the mutant allele; thus, they are more likely to develop the mutant phenotype, regardless of whether the mutation is dominant or recessive. A female may be either heterozygous or homozygous for the mutant allele, which may be dominant or recessive. The terms X-linked dominant or X-linked recessive are therefore only applicable to expression of the mutant"

However, even if the abnormal X chromosome is not widely expressed, the female carrier may still exhibit minor abnormalities. In the latter case, sex-linked inheritance becomes difficult to distinguish from dominant inheritance. Also, sex linkage is deceptive when a disease is lethal to one sex. In contrast to autosomal recessive mutations, the abnormality has more often been one of a basic protein than an enzyme deficiency."

If the parents are unaffected, the child\u2019s condition is most likely the result of a new mutation; the risk of recurrence is extremely low (although not 0, because of the possibility of gonadal mosaicism in one of the parents).

For example, Marfan syndrome, which results from a basic defect in connective tissue, is associated with widespread effects involving the skeleton, eyes, and cardiovascular system, all of which stem from a mutation in the gene encoding fibrillin, a component of connective tissues. On the other hand, several different types of mutations can cause retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited disorder associated with abnormal retinal pigmentation and consequent visual impairment.

As noted before, new germline mutations occur more frequently in fathers of advanced age. For example, the average age of fathers with new germline mutations that cause Marfan\u2019s syndrome is ~37 years, whereas fathers who transmit the disease by inheritance have an average age of ~30 years."

            "content": "There has been great interest in this syndrome, which some geneticists hold accountable at least in part for the preponderance of developmentally delayed males in whom an etiology could not be previously established. A large kindred in whom developmental delay was inherited in an X-linked pattern was first reported by Martin and Bell in 1943. It was in such a family, with X-linked developmental delay, that Lubs, in 1969, discovered a fragile site at the distal end of the long arm of the X chromosome; subsequently, it was established that there is an unstable inherited CGG repeating sequence at this site, which leads to breakage, as discussed previously. At first, it was assumed that the fragile X syndrome was only an example of the Renpenning syndrome (an X-linked hereditary developmental delay in males; see below) until it was pointed out that in this latter condition, stature was reduced, as was the cranial circumference, and further that the X chromosomes of the Renpenning patients"

            "content": "Multifactorial genetic diseases may also be familial. They may present as constitutional disorders with gene abnormalities located on several chromosomes (polygenic, or \u201ccomplex genetics\u201d) or may arise from single nucleotide polymorphisms or copy number variations. Here, the relative contributions of genetic and environmental influences are highly variable. The occurrence of many disorders that display high degrees of familial incidence, such as schizophrenia and Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, but do not strictly conform to classic genetic principles has been attributed to this type of complex genetics. The separation of metabolic-genetic from degenerative diseases (accorded a separate chapter) may disquiet the reader, for there are many overlaps between the two groups. The current division is tenable only until such time as all the degenerative diseases will have been shown to have a comprehensible pathogenesis. The Genetics of Mitochondrial Disease"
