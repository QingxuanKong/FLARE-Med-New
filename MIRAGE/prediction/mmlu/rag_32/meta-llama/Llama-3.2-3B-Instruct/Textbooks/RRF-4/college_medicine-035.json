    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To answer this question, we need to consider the energy released when each of these molecules is completely oxidized in the body. First, let's look at each option: A. One gram of glucose: Glucose is a simple sugar that can be completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy in the form of ATP. The energy released from glucose is approximately 3.75 x 10^7 kJ/g. B. One gram of palmitic acid: Palmitic acid is a fatty acid that can be completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy in the form of ATP. The energy released from palmitic acid is approximately 9.3 x 10^7 kJ/g. C. One gram of leucine: Leucine is an amino acid that can be completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy in the form of ATP. The energy released from leucine is approximately 5.5 x 10^7 kJ/g. D. One gram of alcohol: Alcohol can be completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy in the form of ATP. However, the energy released from alcohol is approximately 7.0 x 10^7 kJ/g. Comparing the energy released from each option, we can see that palmitic acid releases the most energy when completely oxidized, followed by leucine, glucose, and then alcohol. Therefore, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the energy released when each of these molecules is completely oxidized in the body.

Thus, the evolution of cellular respiration, in which O2 is converted to water, enabled organisms to harness much more energy than can be derived from anaerobic metabolism. As we discuss later, the availability of the large amount of energy released by the reduction of molecular oxygen to form water is thought to have been essential to the emergence of multicellular life: this would explain why all large organisms respire. The ability of biological systems to use O2 in this way, however, requires sophisticated chemistry. Once a molecule of O2 has picked up one electron, it forms a superoxide radical anion (O2\u2022\u2013) that is dangerously reactive and rapidly takes up an additional three electrons wherever it can get them, with destructive effects on its immediate environment.

Only the final step of oxidative metabolism consumes molecular oxygen (O2) directly (see Figure 14\u201310). Nearly all the energy available from metabolizing carbohydrates, fats, and other foodstuffs in earlier stages is saved in the form of energy-rich compounds that feed electrons into the respiratory chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These electrons, most of which are carried by NADH, finally combine with O2 at the end of the respiratory chain to form water. The energy released during the complex series of electron transfers from NADH to O2 is harnessed in the inner membrane to generate an electrochemical gradient that drives the conversion of ADP + Pi to ATP. For this reason, the term oxidative phosphorylation is used to describe this final series of reactions (Figure 14\u201312)."

All fuel originates from the diet, but humans do not eat in a nonstop manner all day long.

Nervous system: Monitors oxygen levels and nutrient content in the blood and, in response, modulates the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and endocrine systems and induces feeding and drinking behaviors. In addition to energy metabolism, the cells of the body must maintain a relatively constant intracellular environment to survive. This includes the uptake of fuels needed to produce ATP, the export from the cell of cellular wastes, the maintenance of an appropriate intracellular ionic environment, the establishment of a resting membrane potential, and the maintenance of a constant cellular volume. All of these functions are carried out by specific membrane transport proteins."

Changes in the circulating levels of these hormones allow the body to store energy when food is abundant or to make stored energy available such as during survival crises (for example, famine, severe injury, and \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d situations). This chapter describes the structure, secretion, and metabolic effects of the two hormones that most profoundly affect energy metabolism."

If ATP synthase is inhibited, for example, electrons do not flow down the electron-transport chain and respiration ceases. Since the 1940s, several substances\u2014 such as 2,4-dinitrophenol\u2014have been known to uncouple electron flow from ATP synthesis. Dinitrophenol was once prescribed as a diet drug to aid in weight loss. How would an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation pro mote weight loss? Why do you suppose dinitrophenol is (B) no longer prescribed? 5 14\u20139 In actively respiring liver mitochondria, the pH in 4 the matrix is about half a pH unit higher than it is in the cytosol. Assuming that the cytosol is at pH 7 and the matrix is a sphere with a diameter of 1 \u03bcm [V = (4/3)\u03c0r3], calcu late the total number of protons in the matrix of a respiring liver mitochondrion. If the matrix began at pH 7 (equal to that in the cytosol), how many protons would have to be pumped"
