Rest and analgesics usually eradicate the pain within 2 weeks. However, the pain seems to recur every 2 to 3 months. Medical history is remarkable for gestational diabetes mellitus during her pregnancies. She takes no medications except for an oral contraceptive. She walks 3 miles daily for exercise and works as a sales representative for a computer software company. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 37 kg/m2 .

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the given question: **Step 1: Assess the patient's symptoms and medical history** The patient is a 29-year-old Hispanic woman with recurrent low back pain that recurs every 2-3 months. The pain is relieved by rest and analgesics, but the pain returns after 2 weeks. She has a history of gestational diabetes mellitus during her pregnancies and is obese (BMI 37 kg/m2). She is physically active (3 miles daily) and does not take any medications except for an oral contraceptive. **Step 2: Consider the differential diagnosis** Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, the differential diagnosis for low back pain includes: * Mechanical low back pain * Osteoarthritis * Spondylolisthesis * Degenerative disc disease * Spondylosis * Pregnancy-related low back pain (although she is no longer pregnant) **Step 3: Evaluate the patient's risk factors** The patient's obesity (BMI 37 kg/m2) increases her risk for low back pain due to mechanical factors. Her history of gestational diabetes mellitus may also contribute to her risk. **Step 4: Consider the diagnostic options** The patient's symptoms and medical history do not suggest a red flag for serious conditions such as cancer or infection. Therefore, imaging studies such as MRI or x-rays of the lumbosacral spine may not be immediately necessary. **Step 5: Choose the most appropriate next step** Given the patient's obesity and history of gestational diabetes mellitus, a weight loss program is likely to be beneficial for her overall health and may help alleviate her low back pain. An epidural injection of methylprednisolone may not be necessary at this time, as there is no indication of an acute inflammatory process. Ordering an MRI or x-rays of the lumbosacral spine may not be immediately necessary, as the patient's symptoms are not suggestive of a serious underlying condition. **Conclusion** Based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and risk factors, the most appropriate next step is to recommend a weight loss program. Here is the output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that she may benefit from a weight loss program to alleviate her low back pain. Her obesity (BMI 37 kg/m2) and history of gestational diabetes mellitus increase her risk for mechanical low back pain. An epidural injection of methylprednisolone may not be necessary at this time, and ordering an MRI or x-rays of the lumbosacral spine may not be immediately necessary. A weight loss program is a reasonable next step to consider.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Some known causes include heparin (unfractionated only), prolonged bed rest, and corticosteroid therapy (Cunningham, 2005; Galambosi, 2016). In a few cases, overt hyperparathyroidism or thyrotoxicosis eventually develops. Treatment is problematic and includes calcium and vitamin D supplementation and standard pain management.

Minor degrees follow excessive strain or significant bending, lifting, or walking. It can be reduced by squatting rather than bending when reaching down, by using a back-support pillow when sitting, and by avoiding high-heeled shoes. Back pain complaints increase with progressing gestation and are more prevalent in obese women and those with a history of low back pain. In some cases, troublesome pain may persist for years after the pregnancy (Noren, 2002)."

The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

Studies in Finnish and Chinese populations noted similar efficacy of diet and exercise in preventing or delaying type 2 DM. A number of agents, including \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, metformin, thiazolidinediones, GLP-1 receptor pathway modifiers, and orlistat, prevent or delay type 2 DM but are not approved for this purpose. Individuals with a strong family history of type 2 DM and individuals with IFG or IGT should be strongly encouraged to maintain a normal BMI and engage in regular physical activity. Pharmacologic therapy for individuals with prediabetes is currently controversial because its cost-effectiveness and safety profile are not known. The ADA has suggested that metformin be considered in individuals with both IFG and IGT who are at very high risk for progression to diabetes (age <60 years, BMI \u226535 kg/m2, family history of diabetes in first-degree relative, and women with a history of GDM).

Frequent breaks may prevent muscle strain. Stretching and strengthening exercises can be helpful. The earlier that sonography is performed, the more accurate the gestational age assessment. Specific criteria for \"re-dating\" a pregnancy, that is, reassigning the gestational age and estimated date of delivery using initial sonogram findings, are shown in Table 1 0-1. The only exception to revising the gestational age based on early sonography is if the pregnancy resulted from assisted reproductive technology, in which case accuracy of gestational age assessment is presumed."

Initial general health evaluation should consist of a complete history and physical examination and the following laboratory tests: CBC with differential, chemistry profile, lipid profile, urinalysis, thyroid function tests, urine for microalbuminuria, and ECG (baseline at age 40 or older, repeat yearly). Oral hypoglycemic agents like the sulfonylureas may be considered if fasting blood glucose does not decline or increase and if the patient has diabetes for fewer than 10 years, does not have severe hepatic or renal disease, and is not pregnant or allergic to sulfa drugs. While on oral hypoglycemic agents, check the HgA1C every 3 months and at least two times a year if stable. If the HgA1C is <7% or the postprandial glucose is <200 mg/dL, omit the oral hypoglycemic agents, place on diet alone, and follow every 3 months."

The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease.

The role of exercise and cigarette cessation should be stressed to all patients.

After 3 to 6 months, if the LDL remains above 160 mg/dL with zero to one risk factor or above 130 mg/dL with two or more risk factors, then medical therapy should be initiated. Any woman with coronary heart disease or equivalents such as diabetes or other forms of atherosclerotic disease (peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and symptomatic carotid artery disease) should initiate lifestyle changes if her LDL is 100 mg/dL or more and drug therapy if her LDL is 130 mg/dL or more.

During the year before presentation, her scholastic performance in school deteriorated, she gained 25 lb, she became increasingly lethargic, and nocturia and polydypsia were noted. Initial evaluation documented low follicle-stimulating hormone, elevated prolactin, and a bone age of 10.5 years. Computed tomography scanning documented a large hypothalamic neoplasm that proved to be an ectopic germinoma. The patient was also documented to be hypothyroid and hypoadrenal and to have diabetes insipidus. Despite the elevated prolactin, she had no galactorrhea because of the minimal breast development.
