Document [0] (Title: Surgery_Schwartz) mentions the surgical safety checklist, which is similar to the discharge checklist. In this checklist, the nurse, anaesthetist, and surgeon are mentioned as the individuals involved in completing the form. Similarly, Document [4] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) mentions that the patient, their proxy, and the healthcare provider should discuss and complete the worksheet for others. Document [14] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) also mentions that the procedures for completing advance care planning documents should involve the patient, their proxy, and the healthcare provider.

Educational initiatives that include father and peer counseling may improve these rates (Pisacane, 2005; Wolfberg, 2004). The Baby Friendy Hospital Initiative is an international program to increase rates of exclusive breastfeeding and to extend its duration. It is based on the World Health Organization (1989) Ten Steps to Successul Breaseeding (Table 36-4). Worldwide, almost 20,000 hospitals are designated as \"baby-friendly,\" however, only 10 to 15 percent of hospitals in the United States are so designated (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014; Perrine, 2015). Forrester-Knauss and coworkers (2013) described successul trends toward exclusive breastfeeding in Switzerland during 9 years in which a Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative was implemented. In a large population-based study done in the United States,"

Women with complicated pregnancies-for example, with twins or diabetes-often require return visits at 1-to 2-week intervals (Luke, 2003; Power, 2013). In 1986, the Department of Health and Human Services convened an expert panel to review the content of prenatal care. his report was subsequently reevaluated and revised in 2005 (Gregory, 2006). he panel recommended, among other things, early and continuing risk assessment that is patient speciic. It also endorsed lexibility in clinical visit spacing; health promotion and education, including preconceptional care; medical and psychosocial interventions; standardized documentation; and expanded prenatal care objectives-to include family health up to 1 year after birth."
