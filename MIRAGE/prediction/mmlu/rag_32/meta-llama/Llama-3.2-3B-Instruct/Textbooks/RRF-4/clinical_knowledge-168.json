    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option in relation to the provided medical documents.\\n\\nOption A: Pale stools and dark urine are characteristic of the jaundice of hemolytic anemia. This is correct, as explained in Document [7] (Title: Anatomy_Gray) and Document [9] (Title: Anatomy_Gray) which states that jaundice is usually produced by conditions where there is an excessive breakdown of red blood cells (e.g., in incompatible blood transfusion and hemolytic anemia). The complex biochemical reactions for converting fat-soluble into water-soluble bilirubin may be affected by inflammatory change within the liver (e.g., from hepatitis or chronic liver disease, such as liver cirrhosis) and poisons (e.g., paracetamol overdose). Any obstruction of the biliary tree can produce jaundice, but the two most common causes are gallstones within the bile duct and an obstructing tumor at the head of the pancreas.\\n\\nOption B: Bilirubin is used by the liver in the synthesis of red blood cells. This is incorrect, as explained in Document [9] (Title: Anatomy_Gray) which states that the iron from the hemoglobin molecule is recycled, whereas the porphyrin ring (globin) compounds are broken down to form fat-soluble bilirubin. On reaching the liver via the bloodstream, the fat-soluble bilirubin is converted to a water-soluble form of bilirubin.\\n\\nOption C: Itching may be a sign of obstructive jaundice. This is correct, as explained in Document [1] (Title: Pathology_Robbins) which states that chronic severe jaundice can lead to pruritus (itching), the intensity of which may be so profound that patients scratch their skin raw and risk repeated bouts of potentially life-threatening infection.\\n\\nOption D: Putting a danger of infection sticker on blood samples from an intravenous drug user with jaundice is optional. This is incorrect, as explained in Document [24] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) which states that any evidence for severe disease should prompt hospitalization. This includes evidence of infection, and thus putting a sticker on blood samples from an intravenous drug user with jaundice is a standard precaution to prevent infection.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Even at late stages, they present with nonspecific clinical manifestations, such as anorexia, weight loss, weakness, and, eventually signs and symptoms of liver failure discussed earlier. Jaundice, encephalopathy, and coagulopathy may result from chronic liver disease, much the same as in acute liver failure. However, there are some significant additional features: Chronic severe jaundice can lead to pruritus (itching), the intensity of which may be so profound that patients scratch their skin raw and risk repeated bouts of potentially life-threatening infection. In some patients, severe pruritus is the primary indication for liver transplantation. Pruritus also is frequently seen in other disorders associated with cholestasis, suggesting that it is somehow related to the build up of bile salts in the body, but its precise pathogenesis is unknown."

The data are consistent with an obstructive jaundice in which a block in the common bile duct decreases the secretion of bile containing conjugated bilirubin (CB) into the intestine (stool will be pale in color). The CB regurgitates into the blood (conjugated hyperbilirubinemia). The CB is excreted in the urine (which darkens) and is referred to as urinary bilirubin. Urinary urobilinogen is not present because its source is intestinal urobilinogen, which is low. The other choices do not match the data."

With severe cholestasis, there will also be lightening of the color of the stools and steatorrhea. Jaundice without dark urine usually indicates indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia and is typical of hemolytic anemia and the genetic disorders of bilirubin conjugation, the common and benign form being Gilbert\u2019s syndrome and the rare and severe form being Crigler-Najjar syndrome.

When jaundice is observed, the laboratory evaluation for hyperbilirubinemia should include a total bilirubin measurement to determine the magnitude of hyperbilirubinemia. Bilirubin levels greater than 5 mg/dL on the first day of life or greater than 13 mg/dL thereafter in term infants should be evaluated further with measurement of indirect and direct bilirubin levels, blood typing, Coombs test, complete blood count, blood smear, and reticulocyte count. These tests must be performed before treatment of hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy or exchange transfusion. In the absence of hemolysis or evidence for either the common or the rare causes of nonhemolytic indirect hyperbilirubinemia, the diagnosis is either physiologic or breast milk jaundice. Jaundice present after 2 weeks of age is pathologic and suggests a direct-reacting hyperbilirubinemia."

Physiologic jaundice is the result of many factors that are normal physiologic characteristics of newborns: increased bilirubin production resulting from an increased RBC mass, shortened RBC life span, and hepatic immaturity of ligandin and glucuronosyltransferase.

            "content": "Because the hepatic machinery for conjugating and excreting bilirubin does not fully mature until about 2 weeks of age, almost every newborn develops transient and mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, termed neonatal jaundice or physiologic jaundice of the newborn. This may be exacerbated by breastfeeding, due to the action of bilirubindeconjugating enzymes in breast milk. Nevertheless, sustained jaundice in the newborn is abnormal and is discussed later in the \u201c \u201d section."

            "content": "Renal failure, often reversible with rehydration, is caused by acute tubular necrosis in severe cases with shock. Hepatic injury with increased serum aminotransferase concentrations (38% of cases) is due to focal death of individual hepatocytes without hepatic failure. Jaundice is recognized in 9% of cases and an elevated serum bilirubin concentration in 18\u201330%. Life-threatening bleeding is rare. Anemia develops in 30% of cases and is severe enough to require transfusions in 11%. Blood is detected in the stool or vomitus of 10% of patients, and death has followed massive upper-gastrointestinal hemorrhage."

Posthepatic causes of jaundice include biliary diseases, such as choledocholithiasis, acute cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, other strictures, and neoplasm, and pancreatic disorders, such as acute and chronic pancreatitis, stricture, and malignancy."

Environmental factors rarely contribute to the development of allergic disease. B. The prevalence of atopy has been steadily increasing in the developed world. C. Individuals with variant alleles of GSTP1 and GSTM1 have higher susceptibility to increased airway hyperactivity. D. Children less than 6 months old who are exposed to other children in day care appear to be partially protected against asthma. 14.4 True or False: Like other antibodies, IgE is mainly found in body fluids."
