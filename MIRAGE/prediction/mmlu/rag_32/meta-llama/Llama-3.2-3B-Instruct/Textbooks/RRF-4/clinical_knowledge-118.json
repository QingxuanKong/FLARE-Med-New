It is caused by primary adrenal insufficiency, with both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids usually being deficient. The symptoms of Addison's disease include fatigue, weight loss, and hyperpigmentation in areas of increased friction such as the palmar creases, dorsal foot, nipples, and axillary region. The disease can be caused by autoimmune destruction, tuberculosis, or other conditions. The diagnosis is confirmed by an ACTH stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response.

There is controversy as to which tests to use and how often to screen individuals for disease. A strong family history of autoimmunity should raise suspicion in an individual with an initial component diagnosis. The development of a rarer form of autoimmunity, such as Addison\u2019s disease, should prompt more extensive screening for other linked disorders compared to the diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease, which is relatively common."

The \u201c5.1\u201d allele of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene is an atypical class I HLA molecule MIC-A. The MIC-A5.1 allele has a very strong association with Addison\u2019s disease that is not accounted for by linkage disequilibrium with DR3 or DR4. Its role is complicated because certain HLA class I genes can offset this effect. PTPN22 codes for a polymorphism in a protein tyrosine phosphatase, which acts on intracellular signaling pathways in both T and B lymphocytes. It has been implicated in T1D, Addison\u2019s disease, and other autoimmune conditions. CTLA4 is a receptor on the T cell surface that modulates the activation state of the cell as part of the signal 2 pathway. Polymorphisms of this gene appear to cause downregulation of the cell surface expression of the receptor, leading to decreased T cell activation and proliferation. This appears to contribute"

The myopathic effects of hypothyroidism need to be distinguished from those of a neuropathy, which may rarely complicate hypothyroidism (see Chap. 43). The widespread use of adrenal corticosteroids has created a class of muscle diseases similar to the one that occurs in the Cushing disease as described many decades ago by M\u00fcller and Kugelberg.

            "content": "The differential diagnosis of localized hypomelanosis includes the following primary cutaneous disorders: idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis, postinflammatory hypopigmentation, tinea (pityriasis) versicolor, vitiligo, chemicalor drug-induced leukoderma, nevus depigmentosus (see below), and piebaldism (Table 72-10). In this group of diseases, the areas of involvement are macules or patches with a decrease or absence of pigmentation. Patients with vitiligo also have an increased incidence of several autoimmune disorders, including Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, Graves\u2019 disease, pernicious anemia, Addison\u2019s disease, uveitis, alopecia areata, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and the autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes (types I and II). Diseases of the thyroid gland are the most frequently associated disorders, occurring in up to 30% of patients with vitiligo. Circulating autoantibodies are often found, and the most common ones are antithyroglobulin, antimicrosomal, and antithyroid-stimulating"

Recent studies suggest that postresection hyperkalemia may be more common and last longer than previously appreciated; therefore, it should be screened for in patients who are older and who have had a longer duration of hypertension, impaired kidney function, and higher preoperative aldosterone levels, making them a high-risk group.102 Rarely, acute Addison\u2019s disease may occur 2 to 3 days after adrenalectomy. Adrenalectomy is >90% successful in improving hypokalemia and about 70% successful in cor-recting hypertension. Patients who respond to spironolactone therapy and those with a shorter duration of hypertension with minimal renal damage are more likely to achieve improvement in hypertension, whereas male patients, those >50 years old, and those with multiple adrenal nodules, are least likely to benefit from adrenalectomy.Cushing\u2019s Syndrome.

These sympathoadrenal reactions are brief and sustain the animal in \u201cflight or fight\u201d as discussed in Chap. 24. Animals deprived of adrenal cortex or human beings with Addison disease cannot tolerate stress because they are incapable of mobilizing both the adrenal medulla and adrenal cortex. Prolonged stress and production of ACTH activates all the adrenal hormones (glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and adrenocorticoids) and has been studied extensively in relation to immune reactions and other systemic functions but with no consistent findings that are yet clinically applicable.

It can also lead to enhanced IL-6 secretion and activation of T-cells in thyrocytes leading to a local inflam-matory response. Other susceptibility genes include PTPN22 (encodes the lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase) and CD25, which encodes for the interleukin-2 receptor \u03b1-chain (IL-2R\u03b1).3 Once initiated, the inflammatory process causes sensitized T-helper lymphocytes to stimulate B lymphocytes, which produce anti-bodies directed against the thyroid hormone receptor. TSIs or antibodies that stimulate the TSH-R, as well as TSH-binding inhibiting immunoglobulins or antibodies, have been described. The thyroid-stimulating antibodies stimulate the thyrocytes to grow and synthesize excess thyroid hormone, which is a hall-mark of Graves\u2019 disease. Graves\u2019 disease also is associated with other autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, Addison\u2019s disease, pernicious"
