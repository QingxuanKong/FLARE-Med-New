The protein, apolipoprotein E, participates in cholesterol transport (Chap. 421), and the gene has three alleles: \u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54. The Apo \u03b54 allele confers increased risk of AD in the general population, including sporadic and late-age-of-onset familial forms. Approximately 24\u201330% of the nondemented white population has at least one \u03b54 allele (12\u201315% allele frequency), and about 2% are \u03b54/\u03b54 homozygotes. Among patients with AD, 40\u201365% have at least one \u03b54 allele, a highly significant elevation compared with controls. Conversely, many AD patients have no \u03b54 allele, and \u03b54 carriers may never develop AD. Therefore, \u03b54 is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause AD. Nevertheless, the Apo \u03b54 allele represents the most important genetic risk factor for sporadic AD and acts as a dose-dependent disease modifier, with the earliest age of onset associated with the \u03b54 homozygosity.

ApoE is present in multiple copies on chylomicron remnants and IDL, and mediates their removal via hepatic lipoprotein receptors (Fig. 421-2). FDBL is due to genetic variants of apoE, most commonly apoE2, that result in an apoE protein with reduced ability to bind lipoprotein receptors.

ApoA-II is the second most abundant HDL apolipoprotein and is on approximately two-thirds of the HDL particles. ApoC-I, apoC-II, and apoC-III participate in the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. ApoE also plays a critical role in the metabolism and clearance of triglyceride-rich particles. Most apolipoproteins, other than apoB, exchange actively among lipoprotein particles in the blood. Apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] is a distinctive apolipoprotein and is discussed more below."

            "content": "Missense and nonsense mutations in the apoA-I gene are present in some patients with low plasma levels of HDL-C (usually 15\u201330 mg/ dL), but are a rare cause of low plasma HDL-C levels. Most individuals with low plasma HDL-C levels due to missense mutations in apoA-I do not appear to have premature CHD. Patients who are heterozygous for an Arg173Cys substitution in apoA-I (so-called apoA-IMilano) have very low plasma levels of HDL-C due to impaired LCAT activation and accelerated clearance of the HDL particles containing the abnormal apoA-I. Despite having very low plasma levels of HDL-C, these individuals do not have an increased risk of premature CHD. A few selected missense mutations in apoA-I and apoA-II promote the formation of amyloid fibrils, which can cause systemic amyloidosis."

Patients with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease resulting in a deficiency of a functional chloride transporter, have thickened mucus that impedes the flow of pancreatic enzymes into the duodenum. Emulsification occurs through peristalsis, which provides mechanical mixing, and bile salts that function as detergents. Colipase restores activity to pancreatic lipase in the presence of inhibitory bile salts that bind the micelles. Cholecystokinin is the hormone that causes contraction of the gallbladder and release of stored bile, and secretin causes release of bicarbonate. Chylomicron formation requires synthesis of apolipoprotein B-48. 5.2. Which one of the following statements about lipid absorption from the intestine is correct? A. Dietary triacylglycerol must be completely hydrolyzed to free fatty acids and glycerol before absorption."

Inheritance is dominant, meaning that the condition was inherited from one parent and ~50% of the patient\u2019s siblings can be expected to have hypercholesterolemia. The family history is frequently positive for premature CHD on the side of the family from which the mutation was inherited. Physical findings in many, but not all, patients with heterozygous FH include corneal arcus and tendon xanthomas particularly involving the dorsum of the hands and the Achilles tendons. Untreated heterozygous FH is associated with a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Untreated men with heterozygous FH have an ~50% chance of having a myocardial infarction before age 60 years, and women with heterozygous FH are at substantially increased risk as well. The age of onset of cardiovascular disease is highly variable and depends on the specific molecular defect, the level of LDL-C, and coexisting cardiovascular risk factors. FH heterozygotes with elevated plasma levels of Lp(a) (see"
