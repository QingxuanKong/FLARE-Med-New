Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped by the heart with each beat. It is the product of stroke volume and heart rate. According to the Frank-Starling mechanism, the stroke volume is regulated by preload (the volume of blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole), contractility (the strength of the heart muscle), and afterload (the resistance to ventricular ejection). However, in the context of the question, we are looking for the three factors that directly regulate stroke volume. Preload and afterload are the two primary factors that directly influence stroke volume. Contractility is also a factor that affects stroke volume, but it is not a factor that regulates stroke volume directly. Instead, it is a factor that is influenced by the other two factors. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that includes preload and afterload as the two primary factors that regulate stroke volume.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Analysis of the control of cardiac output has thus far been restricted to the control of stroke volume, and the role of heart rate has not been considered. Analysis of the effect of a change in heart rate on cardiac output is complex because a change in heart rate alters the other three factors (preload, afterload, and myocardial contractility) that determine stroke volume (see Fig. 19.1 ). An increase in heart rate, for example, shortens the duration of diastole. Hence, ventricular filling is diminished; that is, preload is reduced. If an increase in heart rate altered cardiac output, arterial pressure would change; that is, afterload would be altered. A rise in heart rate would increase the net influx of Ca++ per minute into myocardial cells (see also ), and this influx would enhance myocardial contractility."

Cardiac output, the major determinant of tissue perfusion, is the product of stroke volume and heart rate. Hypovolemia leads to decreased ventricular preload that, in turn, reduces the stroke volume. An increase in heart rate is a useful but limited compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output. A shock-induced reduction in myocardial compliance is frequent, reducing ventricular end-diastolic volume and, hence, stroke volume at any given ventricular filling pressure. Restoration of intravascular volume may return stroke volume to normal but only at elevated filling pressures. Increased filling pressures stimulate release of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to secrete sodium and volume to relieve the pressure on the heart.

Thus increases in cardiac output raise Pa, as do increases in peripheral resistance. Conversely, decreases in cardiac output or peripheral resistance decrease Pa. Arterial pulse pressure is systolic pressure minus diastolic pressure. It is principally a function of just one physiological factor, stroke volume, which determines the change in arterial blood volume (a physical factor) during ventricular systole.

Heart rate is regulated by the activity of the autonomic nervous system to modulate the intrinsic cardiac pacemaker.

All of these determinants are interdependent, inasmuch as a change in one determinant of cardiac output almost invariably alters another.

When ventricular filling pressure (preload) is increased, ventricular volume increases progressively, and after several beats, becomes constant and larger. At equilibrium, the volume of blood ejected by the ventricles (stroke volume) with each heartbeat increases to equal the greater quantity of venous return to the right atrium. The increased ventricular volume facilitates ventricular contraction and enables the ventricles to pump a greater stroke volume. This increase in ventricular volume is associated with an increase in length of the individual ventricular cardiac fibers. The increase in fiber length alters cardiac performance mainly by altering the number of myofilament cross-bridges that interact (see Chapter 16)."

Such ancillary factors include the pronounced reduction in peripheral vascular resistance because of the vasodilation in the active skeletal muscles and the increased contractility of cardiac muscle associated with the generalized increase in sympathetic neural activity. Nevertheless, the increase in heart rate is still an important factor. Abundant data show that if the heart rate cannot increase normally during exercise, the augmentation in cardiac output and the capacity for exercise are severely limited.

Mean arterial pressure varies directly with cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. Arterial pulse pressure varies directly with stroke volume but inversely with arterial compliance. 8. Blood flow through capillaries is regulated chiefly by contraction of arterioles (resistance vessels). The capillary endothelium is the source of NO and PGI2, which relax vascular smooth muscles. 9."

Upon completion of this chapter, the student should be able to answer the following questions: 1. What is steady-state balance, and, with water balance as an example, what are the elements needed to achieve steady-state balance? 2. What are the volumes of the body fluid compartments, and how do they change under various conditions? 3. How do the body fluid compartments differ with regard to their composition? 4. What determines the resting membrane potential of cells? 5. How do cells regulate their volume in isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic solutions? 6."
