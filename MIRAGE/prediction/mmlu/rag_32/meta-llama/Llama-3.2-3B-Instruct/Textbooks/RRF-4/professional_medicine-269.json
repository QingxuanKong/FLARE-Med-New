    "question": "A 57-year-old woman comes to the physician because of an 8-week history of difficulty sleeping, fatigue, and muscle tension. During this period, she also has had memory lapses, difficulty concentrating, and has been reprimanded at work for arriving late. Over the past 2 weeks, she has had three episodes of palpitations and shortness of breath that have awakened her from sleep. Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 110/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Mental status examination shows a depressed mood and constricted affect. She says that she is no longer interested in activities that she used to enjoy. She has suicidal ideation without a plan. Her hemoglobin concentration is 11 g/dL, and serum ferritin concentration is 140 ng/mL. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of depression, including difficulty sleeping, fatigue, muscle tension, memory lapses, difficulty concentrating, and suicidal ideation. She also has a history of iron deficiency anemia (indicated by low hemoglobin concentration and elevated ferritin concentration). The patient's symptoms are consistent with depression, and the iron deficiency anemia is a common comorbidity in patients with depression. The appropriate initial step in treatment would be to address the depression, as it is the primary issue. Donepezil therapy is used to treat Alzheimer's disease, ginkgo biloba extract therapy is not typically used for depression, and paroxetine therapy is an SSRI that may be used to treat depression, but it is not the most appropriate initial choice. Ferrous sulfate therapy is used to treat iron deficiency anemia, but it is not the primary issue in this case. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in treatment is to address the depression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Information from a bed partner or family member is often helpful because some patients may be unaware of symptoms such as heavy snoring or may underreport symptoms such as falling asleep at work or while driving. Physicians should inquire about when the patient typically goes to bed, when they fall asleep and wake up, whether they awaken during sleep, whether they feel rested in the morning, and whether they nap during the day. Depending on the primary complaint, it may be useful to ask about snoring, witnessed apneas, restless sensations in the legs, movements during sleep, depression, anxiety, and behaviors around the sleep episode.

A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid. Four days later, electroencephalography (EEG)"

            "content": "The physical examination of patients with fatigue is guided by the history and differential diagnosis. A detailed mental status examination should be performed with particular attention to symptoms of depression and anxiety. A formal neurologic examination is required to determine whether objective muscle weakness is present. This is usually a straightforward exercise, although occasionally patients with fatigue have difficulty sustaining effort against resistance and sometimes report that generating full power requires substantial mental effort. On confrontational testing, they are able to generate full power for only a brief period before suddenly giving way to the examiner. This type of weakness is often referred to as breakaway weakness and may or may not be associated with pain. This is contrasted with weakness due to lesions in the motor tracts or lower motor unit, in which the patient\u2019s resistance can be overcome in a smooth and steady fashion and full power can never be"

            "content": "Differential Diagnosis of Fatigue If one looks critically at patients who seek medical help because of incapacitating exhaustion, lassitude, and fatigability, it is evident that the most commonly overlooked diagnoses are anxiety and depression as described in Chap. 47. The correct conclusion can usually be reached by keeping these illnesses in mind as one elicits the history from patient and family. Difficulty arises when symptoms of the psychiatric illness are so inconspicuous as not to be appreciated; one comes then to suspect the diagnosis only by having eliminated the common medical causes. Repeated observation may bear out the existence of an anxiety state or gloomy mood. Reassurance in combination with a therapeutic trial of antidepressant drugs may suppress symptoms of which the patient was barely aware, thus clarifying the diagnosis. The best that can be done is to assist the patient in adjusting to the adverse circumstances that have brought him under medical surveillance."

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

A number of such patients in our experience have complained of paresthesias in the feet or hands. On close questioning, many of these sensations prove to be odd, particularly numbness in the bones or muscles or fluctuating patches of numbness or paresthesia on the chest, face, or nose. Unusual descriptions may be given if the patient is allowed adequate time to describe the symptoms. A few have reported blurred or \u201cclose to\u201d double vision; in neither case are there physical findings to corroborate the sensory"

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice?
