    "question": "A 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a\u00a02-day\u00a0history of severe epigastric pain and vomiting. Past medical history is negative for any similar episodes. He does not take any medications. He smokes cigarettes, has a 40\u00a0pack-year history, and consumes more than 8\u00a0cans of beer per day. Abdominal examination reveals epigastric tenderness. Laboratory studies reveal a serum amylase level of 467\u00a0U/L (reference range: 28-100\u00a0U/L) and a\u00a0\u03b3-glutamyltransferase\u00a0level of 212\u00a0U/L (reference range: <\u00a055\u00a0U/L).

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the innervation of the abdominal region and how pain is referred to the spinal cord. The epigastric region is innervated by the phrenic nerve (C3-5), the central portion of the diaphragm (C3-5), and the lower thoracic nerves (T5-T12). The pain from the epigastric region is referred to the spinal cord via the posterior rami of T5-T12. However, the phrenic nerve also has some contribution to the pain perception in the epigastric region, but the primary contribution comes from the posterior rami of T5-T12. Given the patient's symptoms and the laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is acute pancreatitis, which is associated with pain in the epigastric region. Therefore, the referred pain in this patient is transmitted to the spinal cord by the posterior rami of T5-T12.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Patients also have associated nausea, emesis, fever, tachycardia, and abnormal findings on abdominal examination. Laboratory studies may reveal leukocytosis, hypocalcemia, and hyperglycemia. Although not required for diagnosis, markers of severity may include hemoconcentration (hematocrit >44%), admission azotemia (BUN >22 mg/dL), SIRS, and signs of organ failure (Table 371-3)."

For example, irritation of the peritoneum on the inferior surface of the diaphragm, which is innervated by the phrenic nerve, can be referred to the skin on the top of the shoulder, which is innervated by other somatic nerves arising at the same spinal cord level. A young man sought medical care because of central abdominal pain that was diffuse and colicky. After some hours, the pain began to localize in the right iliac fossa and became constant. He was referred to an abdominal surgeon, who removed a grossly inflamed appendix. The patient made an uneventful recovery."

            "content": "Physical examination Epigastric tenderness is the most frequent finding in patients with GU or DU. Pain may be found to the right of the midline in 20% of patients. Unfortunately, the predictive value of this finding is rather low. Physical examination is critically important for discovering evidence of ulcer complication. Tachycardia and orthostasis suggest dehydration secondary to vomiting or active GI blood loss. A severely tender, board-like abdomen suggests a perforation. Presence of a succussion splash indicates retained fluid in the stomach, suggesting gastric outlet obstruction."

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"
