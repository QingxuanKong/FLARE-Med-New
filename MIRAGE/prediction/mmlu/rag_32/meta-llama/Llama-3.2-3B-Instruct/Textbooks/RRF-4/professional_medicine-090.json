    "question": "A 19-year-old Asian female college student comes to the university health center because of a 1-week history of nasal stuffiness, occasional clear rhinorrhea, and a mild sore throat. Two days ago, she began to feel hot, but she has not taken her temperature. Medical history is unremarkable and her only medication is an oral contraceptive. She has no history of allergies. She does not smoke cigarettes. BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 116/74 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses tenderness over the left maxillary sinus without purulent drainage. There is clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, enlarged tonsils bilaterally, and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors. Left frontal sinus does not transilluminate. Cardiopulmonary examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis, we need to analyze the provided information. The patient presents with nasal stuffiness, occasional clear rhinorrhea, and a mild sore throat, which are classic symptoms of sinusitis. The physical examination reveals tenderness over the left maxillary sinus without purulent drainage, clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, enlarged tonsils, and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors. The left frontal sinus does not transilluminate. These findings suggest that the sinusitis is likely caused by an infection, and the absence of purulent drainage makes it less likely to be caused by a bacterial infection. The presence of clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane and the enlarged tonsils may indicate an allergic or viral etiology. Considering the patient's age, medical history, and physical examination findings, we can rule out nasal polyps (C) and oral contraceptive use (D) as the underlying mechanism. Eustachian tube dysfunction (A) is a possible cause of sinusitis, but it is not the most likely explanation in this case, given the presence of clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane and the absence of symptoms suggestive of Eustachian tube dysfunction, such as ear fullness or hearing loss. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis is mucosal edema (B), which is a common cause of viral sinusitis, especially in young adults. This is consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

            "content": "Sinus ailments frequently occur in middle-age individuals. Acute infection is usually located in the maxillary and frontal sinuses. Classically, infection in the maxillary sinus results from obstruction of the ostia found in the medial wall of the nose. Fever, malaise, a vague headache, and pain in the maxillary teeth are early symptoms. Reports of \u201cfullness\u201d in the face or exploding pressure behind the eyes often are elicited as well as increasing pain with bending over. Pressure and percussion over the malar areas can cause severe pain. Purulent exudates in the middle meatus of the nose or in the nasopharynx often are present. Five clinical findings are most useful in diagnosis: (i) maxillary toothache, (ii) poor response to nasal decongestants, (iii) abnormal transillumination, (iv) colored visible purulent nasal secretions, and (v) a history of colored nasal discharge.

These relationships are believed to disclose their mechanism; pain is ascribed to filling of the sinuses and its relief to their emptying, induced by the dependent position of the ostia. Bending over intensifies the pain by causing changes in pressure, as does blowing the nose and air travel, especially on descent, when the relative pressure in the blocked sinus rises. Sympathomimetic drugs, such as phenylephrine hydrochloride, which reduce swelling and congestion, tend to relieve the pain. However, the pain may persist after all purulent secretions have disappeared, probably because of persistent inflammation of the membranes, or blockage of the orifices and dissipation of air from the blocked sinus, so called vacuum sinus headaches."

            "content": "The true incidence of sinusitis is unknown. The common cold is the major predisposing factor for developing sinusitis at allages. Other risk factors include allergy, cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection,nasogastric or nasotracheal intubation, immotile cilia syndrome,nasal polyps, and nasal foreign body. Sinusitis also is a frequent problem in immunocompromised children after organtransplantation. Available @ StudentConsult.com Clinical manifestations most commonly include persistent, mucopurulent, unilateral or bilateral rhinorrhea, nasal stuffiness, and cough, especially at night. Less common symptoms include a nasal quality to the voice, halitosis, facial swelling, facial tenderness and pain, and headache. Sinusitis may exacerbate asthma. Culture of the nasal mucosa is not useful. Sinus aspirate culture is the most accurate diagnostic method but is not practical or necessary in immunocompetent patients."

Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"
