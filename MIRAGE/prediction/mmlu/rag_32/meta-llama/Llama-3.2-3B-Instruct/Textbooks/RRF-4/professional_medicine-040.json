    "question": "A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of increased facial hair growth. Her last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased. Serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges. Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. Which of the following best describes this mass?",

    "predict": "After analyzing the symptoms and test results, here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 40-year-old woman presenting with increased facial hair growth, clitoral enlargement, and a 12-cm ovarian mass. The patient's serum testosterone concentration is increased, and the pelvic examination shows virilization. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a hormonal disorder, and the presence of an ovarian mass raises the suspicion of a sex cord-stromal tumor. The patient's age and symptoms are more consistent with a granulosa cell tumor, which is a type of sex cord-stromal tumor that produces estrogen and can cause virilization. The patient's elevated serum testosterone concentration and clitoral enlargement support this diagnosis. The other options are less likely: ovarian carcinoid tumors are typically small and do not cause virilization, Sertoli-Leydig tumors are more common in males and produce androgens, and teratomas are a type of germ cell tumor that can produce a variety of tissues but are not typically associated with virilization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

A markedly elevated free testosterone level (2.5 times the upper normal range) is considered typical of an adrenal androgen-secreting tumor, while moderately elevated free testosterone levels are often ovarian in origin. A DHEAS level greater than 800 \u03bcg/dL is typical of an adrenal tumor. An adrenal tumor is unlikely when serum DHEAS and urinary 17-ketosteroid excretion measurements are in the normal basal range and the serum cortisol concentration is less than 3.3 \u03bcg/dL after dexamethasone administration (195).

Androgen levels should be assessed in any hirsute patient to ensure that adrenal and ovarian tumors are not present and to aid in the diagnosis of PCOS. 2. Acromegaly is suggested by coarse facial features, large doughy hands, and hyperhidrosis and may be confirmed by measuring IGF-1 levels. 3. In patients with truncal obesity, hirsutism, hypertension, and erythematous striae, Cushing syndrome should be ruled out by assessing 24-hour urinary cortisol levels or performing a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test or late night salivary cortisol (126).

In PCOS there may be symptoms of androgen excess, such as acne and hirsutism, and weight gain and, with insulin resistance, acanthosis. If hirsutism or virilization is present, free and total testosterone, androstenedione, and dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate should be measured to rule out ovarian or adrenal tumors. A normal 17-hydroxyprogesterone level rules out late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia. PCOS is diagnosed with two of the following: infrequent menstrual bleeding or secondary amenorrhea, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and polycystic morphology of ovaries on ultrasound. Estradiol may be normal or low; and androgens, including dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate, may be elevated, although not to the extent that a tumor produces.

On physical examina-tion, the sclera of her eyes shows yellow discoloration.

Premature adrenarche can also occur in the absence of progressive pubertal development, but it must be distinguished from late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia and androgen-secreting tumors, in which case it may be termed heterosexual precocity. Premature adrenarche may be associated with obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and the subsequent predisposition to PCOS."

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

            "content": "The normal ovary produces small amounts of androgens, including testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone. Of these, only testosterone has a significant amount of biologic activity, although androstenedione can be converted to testosterone or estrone in peripheral tissues. The normal woman produces less than 200 mcg of testosterone in 24 hours, and about one-third of this is probably formed in the ovary directly. The physiologic significance of these small amounts of androgens is not established, but they may be partly responsible for normal hair growth at puberty, for stimulation of female libido, and, possibly, for metabolic effects. Androgen production by the ovary may be markedly increased in some abnormal states, usually in association with hirsutism and amenorrhea as noted above."
