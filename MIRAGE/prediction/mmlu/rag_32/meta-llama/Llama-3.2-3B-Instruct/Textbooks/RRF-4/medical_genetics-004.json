According to Document [0], malignant hyperthermia is described as having a typical inheritance pattern of autosomal dominant, but with incomplete penetrance. This means that not all individuals with the mutation will express the condition. Additionally, Document [5] states that the disease is allelic with central core disease and minicore disease, which are both linked to mutations in the gene encoding the ryanodine receptor (RYR1). Document [11] also mentions that patients with central core disease and King-Denborough syndrome have a propensity to malignant hyperthermia. Therefore, the pattern of inheritance of malignant hyperthermia is likely to be autosomal dominant, as it is linked to a mutation in the RYR1 gene, which is located on an autosome (not a sex chromosome).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

In some of these instances, it has been found to be caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the ryanodine receptor. The typical inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant but penetrance is incomplete; some affected members may develop congenital central core myopathy. Closely related is the neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which is the result of an idiosyncratic reaction to neuroleptic drugs (also discussed in Chap. 41). Wolff and colleagues have described a syndrome of periodic hyperthermia, associated with vomiting, hypertension, and weight loss and accompanied by an excessive excretion of glucocorticoids; the symptoms had no apparent explanation, although there was a symptomatic response to chlorpromazine."

Acute episodes are precipitated by exposure to anesthetic agents in patients with a genetic predisposition. Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, central core myopathy, and other myopathies are susceptible, although malignant hyperpyrexia can also occur in children without muscle disease as an autosomal dominant genetic disorder. A family history of unexplained death during anesthesia is often noted. Serum CK levels rise and myoglobinuria can result in tubular necrosis and acute renal failure. Diagnosis of idiopathic malignant hyperthermia is possible with genetic testing or an in vitro muscle contraction test that reveals excessive tonic contracture on exposure to halothane and caffeine. Treatment consists of IV dantrolene, sodium bicarbonate, and cooling."

Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis results from mutations in the gene encoding the skeletal muscle sodium channel SCN4A, which regulates sodium entry during contraction. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare syndrome characterized by tachycardia, tachypnea, muscle spasms, and hyperpyrexia. It is triggered when patients carrying mutations in the ryanodine receptor RYR1, a calcium efflux channel, receive halogenated anesthetic agents or succinylcholine during surgery. On exposure to anesthetic, the mutated receptor leads to increased efflux of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, producing tetany and excessive heat production. There is some evidence that people carrying RYR1 mutations also are unusually susceptible to exertional hyperthermia (heat stroke)."

These swine have an inherited defect in the ryanodine receptor, a protein component of the calcium channel of the sarcoplasm that is sensitive to both caffeine and ryanodine. However, one of several similar defects in ryanodine is found in somewhat fewer than 20 percent of people with the susceptibility to malignant hypothermia. It is presumed that other yet unidentified allelic mutations of this receptor protein or another that controls the structure of the calcium channel account for the remainder of cases. The cause of the high fever is unknown; it is probably caused by the muscle spasm, but an effect of the anesthetic on heat-regulating centers has not been excluded."

However, the genetic loci identified to date account for less than 50% of malignant hyperthermia-susceptible individuals, and genetic testing cannot definitively determine malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. Currently, the most reliable test to establish susceptibility is the in vitro caffeine-halothane contracture test using skeletal muscle biopsy samples.

It is characterized by rapidly rising body temperature, extreme muscular rigidity, and a high mortality rate. Since the original report by Denborough, as larger experience was gained with this entity, it proved in some cases to be a metabolic myopathy inherited as a dominant trait, rendering the individual vulnerable to any volatile anesthetic agent, particularly halothane, and to the muscle relaxant succinylcholine. The fundamental cause in a proportion of cases is an aberration in a component of the ryanodine calcium channel. Malignant hyperthermia has been estimated to occur approximately once in the course of every 50,000 administrations of general anesthesia."

This disorder was described before the introduction of neuroleptic drugs, and in a small proportion of cases, has been related to a mutation of the ryanodine receptor gene.

As alluded above, this myopathy is caused by point mutations of RYR1, encoding the calcium-release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle; mutations of this gene also account for some cases of inherited malignant hyperthermia (Chap. 23).

In cases surviving beyond 24 h, there was almost complete degeneration of the Purkinje cells, with gliosis throughout the cerebellar cortex as well as degeneration of the dentate nuclei. The changes in the cerebellar cortex were equally pronounced in the hemispheres and vermis.

For example, in systemic sepsis, fever (hyperpyrexia) can be rapid in onset, and temperatures can exceed 40.5\u00b0C (104.9\u00b0F). Hyperthermia is often diagnosed on the basis of the events immediately preceding the elevation of core temperature\u2014 e.g., heat exposure or treatment with drugs that interfere with thermoregulation. In patients with heat stroke syndromes and in those taking drugs that block sweating, the skin is hot but dry, whereas in fever the skin can be cold as a consequence of vasoconstriction.

In contrast to fever in infections, hyperthermia does not involve pyrogenic molecules. Exogenous heat exposure and endogenous heat production are two mechanisms by which hyperthermia can result in dangerously high internal temperatures. Excessive heat production can easily cause hyperthermia despite physiologic and behavioral control of body temperature. For example, work or exercise in hot environments can produce heat faster than peripheral mechanisms can lose it. For a detailed discussion of hyperthermia, see Chap. 479e."

One of these, described by Ricker and colleagues, has been designated myotonia fluctuans, because muscle stiffness fluctuated in severity from day to day. In other respects the clinical features resemble those of myotonia congenita, including provocation of attacks of myotonia by exercise. The muscle stiffness is only slightly sensitive to cold but is markedly aggravated by the ingestion of potassium and, interestingly, never progresses to muscular weakness or paralysis. Myotonia permanens is the name given to a severe, persistent myotonia and marked hypertrophy of muscles, particularly of the neck and shoulders. The EMG discloses continuous muscle activity. This disease was discovered in the course of genotyping a patient who earlier had been reported by Spaans"

            "content": "Like hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, paramyotonia congenita is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner and both diseases have been linked to the same gene (SCN4A), which encodes the alpha subunit of the muscle membrane sodium channel; the two mutations are allelic."

            "content": "The well-known uncomplicated febrile seizure, specific to infants and children between 6 months and 5 years of age (peak incidence ages 9 to 20 months) and with a strong inherited tendency, is generally regarded as a benign condition. The frequency has been estimated to be approximately 4 per 1,000 children under the age of 5 but reportedly twice as high in Japanese children. It usually takes the form of a single, generalized motor seizure occurring as the patient\u2019s core temperature rises or reaches its peak. Seldom does the seizure last longer than a few minutes and by the time an EEG can be obtained, there is no abnormality and recovery is complete. The seizures do not recur during the same episode of fever. The temperature is usually above 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F)."

            "content": "This is one of the most dreaded complications of radiation therapy. It is a progressive myelopathy that follows, after a variable latent period, the radiation of malignant lesions in the vicinity of the spinal cord. The incidence of this complication is difficult to determine because many patients die of their malignant disease before the myelopathy has fully evolved but it was in previous eras of delivery of radiation estimated to be between 2 and 3 percent (Palmer). According to Douglas and colleagues, patients who have undergone hyperthermia as an adjunctive treatment for cancer are particularly vulnerable to radiation myelopathy."
