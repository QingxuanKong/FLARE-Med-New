    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the given options and relevant documents. The atrioventricular (AV) bundle, also known as the bundle of His, is a part of the heart's electrical conduction system. It is responsible for transmitting the electrical impulses from the atrioventricular node to the ventricles. According to Document [0] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) and Document [1] (Title: Anatomy_Gray), the AV bundle is formed of modified cardiac muscle fibers and is a direct continuation of the atrioventricular node. Document [1] (Title: Anatomy_Gray) also states that the AV bundle passes from the right atrium to the ventricular septum via the membranous septum of the fibrous skeleton. This indicates that the AV bundle is formed of modified cardiac muscle fibers and is a continuation of the atrioventricular node, not autonomic nerve processes. Therefore, options A and C can be eliminated. Option B is incorrect because the AV bundle is not formed of Purkinje fibers, but rather modified cardiac muscle fibers. Option D is the correct answer because it states that the AV bundle is formed of Purkinje fibers and forms one of several electrical connections between the atria and ventricles, which is consistent with Document [0] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) and Document [1] (Title: Anatomy_Gray).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

A monophasic R wave or Rs complex in AVR or concordance from V1 to V6 of monophasic R or S waves is also relatively specific for VT (Fig. 277-7). Other QRS morphology criteria have also been described, but all have limitations and are not very reliable in patients with severe heart disease. In patients with known bundle branch block, the same QRS morphology during tachycardia as during sinus rhythm suggests supraventricular tachycardia rather than VT, but is not absolutely reliable. An electrophysiologic study is sometimes required for definitive diagnosis. Rarely, noise and movement artifacts on telemetry recordings can simulate VT; prompt recognition can avoid unnecessary tests and interventions."

Concurrently, the wave of excitation in the atria stimulates the atrioventricular node, which is located near the opening of the coronary sinus, close to the attachment of the septal cusp of the tricuspid valve, and within the atrioventricular septum (Fig. 3.83A). The atrioventricular node is a collection of specialized cells that forms the beginning of an elaborate system of conducting tissue, the atrioventricular bundle, which extends the excitatory impulse to all ventricular musculature. The atrioventricular bundle is a direct continuation of the atrioventricular node (Fig. 3.83A). It follows along the lower border of the membranous part of the interventricular septum before splitting into right and left bundles."

This difference is related to the fact that heart block in inferior infarction is commonly a result of increased vagal tone and/or the release of adenosine and therefore is transient. In anterior wall infarction, however, heart block is usually related to ischemic malfunction of the conduction system, which is commonly associated with extensive myocardial necrosis."

Conduction block in the left or right bundle branch or activation of the ventricles from an accessory pathway produces a wide QRS complex during supraventricular tachycardia that must be distinguished from ventricular tachycardia (Chap. 277). Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia may be divided into physiologic sinus tachycardia and pathologic tachycardia (Table 276-1).

The contraction or beat of the heart is regulated and coordinated by specialized and modified cardiac muscle cells that are found in nodes and muscle bundles. The beat of the heart is initiated at the sinoatrial (SA) node which consists of a group of specialized cardiac muscle cells located at the junction of the superior vena cava in the right atrium. The impulse spreads from this node along the cardiac mus-cle fibers of the atria. The impulse is then received at the atrioventricular (AV) node which is lo-cated on the inner or medial wall of the right ventricle adjacent to the tricuspid valve. Specialized cardiac muscle cells then conduct impulses from the AV node along the ventricular septum and into the ventricular walls. Within the ventricular septum, the specialized cells are grouped into a bundle, the AV bundle (of His). This bundle then divides into two main branches, a left and right bundle branch,"

            "content": "The normal cardiac impulse is generated by pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node situated at the junction of the right atrium and the superior vena cava (see Fig. 268-1). This impulse is transmitted slowly through nodal tissue to the anatomically complex atria, where it is conducted more rapidly to the atrioventricular node (AVN), inscribing the P wave of the ECG (see Fig. 268-2). There is a perceptible delay in conduction through the anatomically and functionally heterogeneous AVN. The time needed for activation of the atria and the AVN delay is represented as the PR interval of the ECG. The AVN is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles in the normal heart. The electrical impulse emerges from the AVN and is transmitted to the His-Purkinje system, specifically the common bundle of His, then the left and right bundle branches, and then to the Purkinje network, facilitating activation of ventricular muscle. In normal circumstances, the ventricles are"

            "content": "Idioventricular Rhythms Three or more ventricular beats at a rate slower than 100 beats/min are termed idioventricular rhythm (Fig. 277-1C). Automaticity is the likely mechanism. Idioventricular rhythms are common during acute MI (Chap. 295) and may emerge during sinus bradycardia. Atropine may be administered to increase the sinus rates if the loss of atrioventricular synchrony leads to hemodynamic compromise. This rhythm is also common in patients with cardiomyopathies or sleep apnea. It can also be idiopathic, often emerging when the sinus rate slows during sleep. Therapy should target any underlying cause and correction of bradycardia. Specific therapy for asymptomatic idioventricular rhythm is not necessary."

Electrical impulses are generated at the sinoatrial (SA) node, a group of specialized nodal cardiac muscle cells located near the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium (see Fig. 13.5). Since the SA node has the fastest rate of depolarizations, it is referred to as the pacemaker of the heart. The pacemaker rate of the SA node is about 60 to 100 beats per minute. The SA node initiates an impulse that spreads along the cardiac muscle fibers of the atria and along internodal tracts composed of modified cardiac muscle fibers. The impulse is then picked up at the atrioventricular (AV) node and carried across the fibrous skeleton to the ventricles by the AV bundle (of His). The bundle divides into smaller right and left bundle branches and then into subendothelial branches, commonly called Purkinje fibers. The"
