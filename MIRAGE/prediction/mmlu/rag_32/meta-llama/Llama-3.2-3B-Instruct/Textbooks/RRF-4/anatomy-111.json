    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the question: The question asks which foramina pierce the sphenoid bone. To answer this, we need to examine the anatomy of the sphenoid bone and its foramina. Document [0] mentions that two apertures (the foramen ovale and the foramen spinosum) pass through the base of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone, allowing the mandibular nerve [V3] and the middle meningeal artery to pass between the middle cranial fossa and infratemporal fossa. Document [5] further describes the pterygoid canal, which is a bony canal running horizontally through the root of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone. It opens anteriorly into the pterygopalatine fossa and posteriorly continues through the cartilage filling the foramen lacerum and opens into the middle cranial fossa. Document [12] mentions that the foramen rotundum is located in the medial wall of the middle cranial fossa and opens onto the lateral wall of the nasal cavity, and it communicates with the middle cranial fossa and open onto the posterior wall. Document [13] also mentions that the foramen rotundum is a large foramen that allows the maxillary nerve [V2] to pass from the middle cranial fossa to the pterygopalatine fossa. Document [15] does not mention any foramina that pierce the sphenoid bone, but mentions the styloid process, which is a bony projection from the underside of the temporal bone, not the sphenoid bone. From the information provided, we can see that the foramina that pierce the sphenoid bone are the foramen ovale, foramen spinosum, and foramen rotundum. Therefore, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The foramina that pierce the sphenoid bone are the foramen ovale, foramen spinosum, and foramen rotundum. These foramina are described in documents [0], [5], and [12].\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Two apertures (the foramen ovale and the foramen spinosum) pass through the base of the greater wing and allow the mandibular nerve [V3] and the middle meningeal artery, respectively, to pass between the middle cranial fossa and infratemporal fossa. In addition, one or more small sphenoidal emissary foramina penetrate the base of the greater wing anteromedial to the foramen ovale and allow emissary veins to pass between the pterygoid plexus of veins in the infratemporal fossa and the cavernous sinus in the middle cranial fossa. Projecting vertically downward from the greater wing immediately medial to the foramen spinosum is the irregularly shaped spine of the sphenoid, which is the attachment site for the cranial end of the sphenomandibular ligament."

Innervation of the sphenoidal sinuses is provided by: the posterior ethmoidal branch of the ophthalmic nerve [V1], and the maxillary nerve [V2] via orbital branches from the pterygopalatine ganglion.

Unlike the nares, which have flexible borders of cartilage and soft tissues, the choanae are rigid openings completely surrounded by bone, and their margins are formed: inferiorly by the posterior border of the horizontal plate of the palatine bone, laterally by the posterior margin of the medial plate of the pterygoid process, and medially by the posterior border of the vomer. The roof of the choanae is formed: anteriorly by the ala of the vomer and the vaginal process of the medial plate of the pterygoid process, and posteriorly by the body of the sphenoid bone. There are a number of routes by which nerves and vessels enter and leave the soft tissues lining each nasal cavity (Fig. 8.242), and these include the cribriform plate, sphenopalatine foramen, incisive canal, and small foramina in the lateral wall, and around the margin of the nares."

The parts of the sphenoid bone that form part of the bony framework of the infratemporal fossa are the lateral plate of the pterygoid process and the greater wing (Fig. 8.136). The greater wing also forms part of the medial wall of the temporal fossa. The greater wings extend one on each side from the body of the sphenoid. They project laterally from the body and curve superiorly. The inferior and lateral surfaces form the roof of the infratemporal fossa and the medial wall of the temporal fossa, respectively."

Generally, cancers of the pituitary have only one way to expand, which is up into the brain and against the optic chiasma. Thus any increase in size of the pituitary is commonly associated with visual field or visual acuity abnormalities and headaches. The sella turcica is sealed off from the brain by a membrane called the diaphragma sellae. The Neurohypophysis"

Mature spongy bone is similar in structure to mature compact bone except that the tissue is arranged as trabeculae or spicules; numerous interconnecting marrow spaces of various sizes are present between the bone tissue. The matrix of the bone is lamellated. Arteries that enter the marrow cavity through the nutrient foramina supply blood to the shaft of long bones. Nutrient foramina are openings in the bone through which blood vessels pass to reach the marrow. The greatest numbers of nutrient foramina are found in the diaphysis and epiphysis (Fig. 8.4). Metaphyseal arteries supplement the blood supply to the bone. Veins that exit through the nutrient foramina"

Immediately lateral to the basilar part of the occipital bone is the petrous part of the petromastoid part of each temporal bone. Wedge-shaped in its appearance, with its apex anteromedial, the petrous part of the temporal bone is between the greater wing of the sphenoid anteriorly and the basilar part of the occipital bone posteriorly. The apex forms one of the boundaries of the foramen lacerum, an irregular opening filled in life with cartilage (Fig. 8.23). The other boundaries of the foramen lacerum are the basilar part of the occipital bone medially and the body of the sphenoid anteriorly. Posterolateral from the foramen lacerum along the petrous part of the temporal bone is the large circular opening for the carotid canal."
