Her mother says, \"She is getting almost all A's in school and she is on the track team.\" You ask the patient about her diet and she responds, \"I'm kind of a picky eater.\" She requests a laxative to help with her constipation.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old girl presenting with abdominal pain and constipation, and her mother reports that she is a good student and athlete. This suggests that the patient may be experiencing stress-related constipation. The patient's request for a laxative to help with her constipation also suggests that she may be experiencing psychological distress. Therefore, it is essential to obtain a thorough history to rule out other potential causes of constipation, such as gastrointestinal disorders or eating habits. The correct answer is A. Color, caliber, and frequency of bowel movements, as this information can help identify the type and severity of constipation, which can inform further evaluation and treatment. Additionally, the patient's age and request for a laxative may indicate the need to consider adolescent-specific issues, such as stress, anxiety, or eating habits. The other options, while potentially relevant, are not as directly related to the patient's presentation and request for a laxative.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"
