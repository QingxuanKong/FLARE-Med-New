Blood entering the right ventricle via the right atrium is pumped through the pulmonary arterial system at a mean pressure about one seventh that in the systemic arteries. The blood then passes through the lung capillaries, in which CO2 in the blood is released and O2 is taken up. The O2-rich blood returns via the pulmonary veins to the left atrium, where it is pumped from the ventricle to the periphery, which thus completes the cycle. Blood moves rapidly through the aorta and its arterial branches. As these branches approach the periphery, the branches narrow, and their walls become thinner. They also change histologically.

            "content": "Hypoxia,Ischemia,andInfarction The brain is a highly oxygen-dependent tissue that requires a continual supply of glucose and oxygen from the blood. Although it constitutes no more than 2% of body weight, the brain receives 15% of the resting cardiac output and is responsible for 20% of total body oxygen consumption. Cerebral blood flow normally remains stable over a wide range of blood pressure and intracranial pressure because of autoregulation of vascular resistance. The brain may be deprived of oxygen by two general mechanisms: Functional hypoxia, caused by a low partial pressure of oxygen (e.g., high altitude), impaired oxygen-carrying capacity (e.g., severe anemia, carbon monoxide poisoning), or toxins that interfere with oxygen use (e.g., cyanide poisoning) Ischemia, either transient or permanent, due to tissue hypoperfusion, which can be caused by hypotension, vascular obstruction, or both"

            "content": "The various structural anomalies in congenital heart disease can be assigned to three major groups based on their hemodynamic and clinical consequences: (1) malformations causing a left-to-right shunt; (2) malformations causing a right-to-left shunt (cyanotic congenital heart diseases); and (3) malformations causing obstruction. A shunt is an abnormal communication between chambers or blood vessels. Depending on pressure relationships, shunts permit the flow of blood from the left to the right side of the heart (or vice versa). With right-to-left shunt, a dusky blueness of the skin (cyanosis) results because the pulmonary circulation is bypassed and poorly oxygenated blood collected from the venous system enters the systemic arterial circulation."

            "content": "Oxygen consumption is estimated as 125 mL oxygen/minute \u00d7 body surface area, and the arterial-venous oxygen difference is determined by first calculating the oxygen carrying capacity of blood (hemoglobin [g/100 mL] \u00d7 1.36 [mL oxygen/g hemoglobin] \u00d7 10) and multiplying this product by the fractional oxygen saturation. The thermodilution method measures a substance that is injected into and adequately mixes with blood. In contemporary practice, thermodilution cardiac outputs are measured using temperature as the indicator. Measurements are made with a thermistor-tipped catheter that detects temperature deviations in the pulmonary artery after the injection of 10 mL of room-temperature normal saline into the right atrium."
