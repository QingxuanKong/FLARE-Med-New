In addition to steroid receptors that regulate gene expression, evidence also suggests the existence of membrane and juxtamembrane steroid receptors that mediate the rapid, nongenomic effects of steroid hormones. Some membrane proteins do not fit the classic definition of receptors, but they subserve a receptor-like function in that they recognize extracellular signals and transduce the signals into an intracellular second messenger that has a biological effect. For example, on activation by a ligand, some membrane proteins undergo regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP), which elaborates a cytosolic peptide fragment that enters the nucleus and regulates gene expression ("

For example, estrogen synthesis by the ovary and placenta requires at least two cell types to complete the conversion of cholesterol to estrogen. This means that one cell secretes a precursor and a second cell converts the precursor to estrogen. There is also considerable peripheral conversion of active steroid hormones. For example, the testes secrete little estrogen. However, adipose, muscle, and other tissues express the enzyme for converting testosterone (a potent androgen) to estradiol-17\u03b2 (a potent estrogen). Thus the overall production of a particular steroid hormone is equivalent to the sum of the secretion of this steroid hormone from a steroidogenic cell type and peripheral conversion of other steroids to the particular steroid hormone ("

Stress is also a major secretagogue of the longer-acting steroid hormone cortisol, which regulates glucose utilization, immune and inflammatory homeostasis, and numerous other processes. In addition the adrenal glands regulate salt and volume homeostasis through the steroid hormone aldosterone.
