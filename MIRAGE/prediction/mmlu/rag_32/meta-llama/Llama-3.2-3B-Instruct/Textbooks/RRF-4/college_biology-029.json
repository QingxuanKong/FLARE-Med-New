    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the adaptations that plants have evolved to minimize water loss in environments with high temperatures. One of the primary mechanisms for water loss in plants is transpiration, which occurs mainly through the stomata on the leaves. However, in hot environments, stomata can be a significant source of water loss. In such cases, plants may adapt by reducing the number or size of their stomata to minimize water loss. Another adaptation could be related to the cuticle, which is the outermost layer of the plant's epidermis. A thinner cuticle would allow less water to evaporate, reducing water loss. Spines or thorns on leaves can also reduce transpiration by providing a barrier to water loss. Finally, a large surface-to-volume ratio can increase the rate of evaporation, which would be counterproductive in hot environments. Therefore, we need to evaluate the options and determine which one is most likely to minimize water loss in hot environments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Although the fluid in the plant cell wall contains more solutes than does the water in the plant\u2019s external milieu (for example, soil), it is still hypotonic in comparison with the cell interior. This osmotic imbalance causes the cell to develop a large internal hydrostatic pressure, or turgor pressure, which pushes outward on the cell wall, just as an inner tube pushes outward on a tire. The turgor pressure increases just to the point where the cell is in osmotic equilibrium, with no net influx of water despite the salt imbalance. The turgor pressure generated in this way may reach 10 or more atmospheres, about five times that in the average car tire. This pressure is vital to plants because it is the main driving force for cell expansion during growth, and it provides much of the mechanical rigidity of living plant tissues.

When the pH in the environment drops, for example, the flux of H+ into the cytosol is balanced, at least in part, by an increased transport of H+ into the vacuole, which tends to keep the pH in the cytosol constant. Similarly, many plant cells maintain an almost constant turgor pressure despite large changes in the tonicity of the fluid in their immediate environment. They do so by changing the osmotic pressure of the cytosol and vacuole\u2014in part by the controlled breakdown and resynthesis of polymers such as polyphosphate in the vacuole, and in part by altering the transport rates of sugars,"

As depicted in Fig. 2.1 , there are multiple inputs and outputs of water, many of which can vary but nevertheless cannot be regulated. For example, the amount of water lost through the lungs depends on the humidity of the air and the rate of respiration (e.g., low humidity and rapid breathing increase water loss from the lungs). Similarly, the amount of water lost as sweat varies according to ambient temperature and physical activity. Finally, water loss via the gastrointestinal tract can increase from a normal level of 100 to 200 mL/day to many liters with acute diarrhea. Of these inputs and outputs, the only two that can be regulated are increased ingestion of water in response to thirst and alterations in urine output by the kidneys (see Chapter 35)."

Other routes of water loss from the body include evaporation from cells of the skin and respiratory passages. Collectively, water loss by these routes is termed insensible water loss because the individual is unaware of its occurrence. Production of sweat accounts for the loss of additional water. Water loss by this mechanism can increase dramatically in a hot environment, with exercise, or in the presence of fever ( 35.2 ). Finally, water can be lost from the gastrointestinal tract. Fecal water loss is normally small (\u2248100 mL/day) but can increase dramatically with diarrhea (e.g., 20 L/ day with cholera). Vomiting can also cause gastrointestinal water losses."

Cold over a period of weeks or months progressively reduces the level of expression of a remarkable gene called Flowering locus C (Flc). Flc encodes a transcriptional repressor that suppresses expression of the Ft flowering promoter. How does vernalization shut down Flc so as to lift the block to flowering? The effect involves a noncoding RNA called Coolair that overlaps with the Flc gene and is produced when the temperature is low (Figure 21\u201344). Together with cold-induced chromatin modifiers, including Polycomb-group proteins, Coolair coordinates the switching of Flc chromatin to a silent state (discussed in Chapters 4 and 7). The degree of silencing depends on the length of cold exposure enabling the plants to distinguish the odd chilly night from the whole of winter."

Arrest of the circulation to a hand by a pressure cuff plus immersion of that hand in cold water induces vasoconstriction in the skin of the other extremities that are exposed to room temperature. When the circulation to the chilled hand is not occluded, the reflex-generalized vasoconstriction is caused in part by the cooled blood that returns to the general circulation.

            "content": "Heat loss occurs through five mechanisms: radiation (55\u201365% of heat loss), conduction (10\u201315% of heat loss, much increased in cold water), convection (increased in the wind), respiration, and evaporation; both of the latter two mechanisms are affected by the ambient temperature and the relative humidity. The preoptic anterior hypothalamus normally orchestrates thermo-regulation (Chap. 23). The immediate defense of thermoneutrality is via the autonomic nervous system, whereas delayed control is mediated by the endocrine system. Autonomic nervous system responses include the release of norepinephrine, increased muscle tone, and shivering, leading to thermogenesis and an increase in the basal metabolic rate. Cutaneous cold thermoreception causes direct reflex vasoconstriction to conserve heat. Prolonged exposure to cold also stimulates the thyroid axis, leading to an increased metabolic rate."

            "content": "Figure 15\u201373 One way in which phytochromes mediate a light response in plant cells. When activated by red light, the phytochrome, which is a dimeric protein kinase, phosphorylates itself and then moves into the nucleus, where it activates transcription regulatory proteins to stimulate the transcription of red-lightresponsive genes. How does a cell integrate the information received from its many different cell-surface receptors to make all-or-none decisions? Much of what we know about cell signaling comes from biochemical studies of isolated proteins in test tubes. What is the precise quantitative behavior of intracellular signaling networks in an intact cell, or in an intact animal, where countless other signals and cell components might influence signaling specificity and strength? How do intracellular signaling circuits generate specific and dynamic signaling patterns such as oscillations and waves, and how are these patterns sensed and interpreted by the cell?"

            "content": "Ethylene is an important example. This small gas molecule (Figure 15\u201369A) can influence plant development in various ways; it can, for example, promote fruit ripening, leaf abscission, and plant senescence. It also functions as a stress signal in response to wounding, infection, flooding, and so on. When the shoot of a germinating seedling, for instance, encounters an obstacle, ethylene promotes a complex response that allows the seedling to safely bypass the obstacle (Figure 15\u201369B and C). Plants have various ethylene receptors, which are located in the endoplasmic reticulum and are all structurally related. They are dimeric, multipass transmembrane proteins, with a copper-containing ethylene-binding domain and a domain that interacts with a cytoplasmic protein called CTR1, which is closely related Figure 15\u201369 The ethylene-mediated triple response that occurs when the growing shoot of a germinating seedling encounters an obstacle underground."
