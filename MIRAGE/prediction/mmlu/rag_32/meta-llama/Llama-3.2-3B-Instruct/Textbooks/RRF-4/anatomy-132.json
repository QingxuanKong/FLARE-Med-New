The anterior two-thirds of the tongue is supplied by the lingual nerve, which is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V3). The lingual nerve carries general sensation (touch, pressure, temperature) from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) carries taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, but not somatic sensation. The glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) carries taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue, and the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve X) is a motor nerve that supplies the muscles of the tongue. Therefore, the correct answer is the lingual branch of the mandibular trigeminal nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

One use of such testing is to corroborate the existence of Bell palsy by comparing taste sensation on each side of the anterior tongue (see Chap. 44). A stimulus that has been used as a surrogate for sour sensation is a low-voltage direct current, the electrodes of which can be accurately placed on the tongue surface. If the taste loss is bilateral, mouthwashes with a dilute solution of sucrose, sodium chloride, citric acid, and quinine may be used. After swishing, the test fluid is spit out and the mouth rinsed with water. The patient indicates whether a taste was detected and then is asked to try to identify it.

However, an isolated lesion of the ninth cranial nerve is a rarity and therefore the effects are not fully known. In one personally observed case of bilateral surgical interruption of the ninth nerves, verified at autopsy, there had been no demonstrable loss of taste or other sensory or motor impairment. This suggests that the tenth nerve may be responsible for these functions, at least in some individuals. The role of the ninth nerve in the reflex control of blood pressure and ventilation has been alluded to earlier but referable clinical manifestations from damage of this cranial nerve are infrequent except perhaps for syncope as noted below."

Extreme drying of the tongue from any cause may lead to temporary loss or reduction of the sense of taste (ageusia or hypogeusia), as saliva is essential for normal taste function. Saliva acts as a solvent for chemical substances in food and for conveying them to taste receptors. Dryness of the mouth (xerostomia) from inadequate saliva, as occurs in Sj\u00f6gren syndrome; hyperviscosity of saliva, as in cystic fibrosis; irradiation of head and neck; and pandysautonomia all interfere with taste. Also, in familial dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome), the number of circumvallate and fungiform papillae is reduced, accounting for a diminished ability to taste sweet and salty foods.

Complete interruption of the nerve results in paralysis of one side of the tongue.

The alteration in sensation in the soft palate is due to neurapraxia of the glossopharyngeal nerve [IX]. The paralyzed left cord results from neurapraxia of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, while the inability to shrug the shoulder is due to neurapraxia of the accessory nerve [XI].

Significant impairment of whole-mouth gustatory function is rare outside of generalized metabolic disturbances or systemic use of some medications, because taste bud regeneration occurs and peripheral damage alone would require the involvement of multiple cranial nerve pathways. Nonetheless, taste can be influenced by (1) the release of foul-tasting materials from the oral cavity from oral medical conditions or appliances (e.g., gingivitis, purulent sialadenitis), (2) transport problems of tastants to the taste buds (e.g., drying of the orolingual mucosa, infections, inflammatory conditions), (3) damage to the taste buds themselves (e.g., local trauma,"

            "content": "Lesions at and around the stylomastoid foramen Lesions at and around the stylomastoid foramen are the commonest abnormality of the facial nerve [VII] and usually result from a viral inflammation of the nerve within the bony canal before exiting through the stylomastoid foramen. Typically the patient has an ipsilateral loss of motor function of the whole side of the face. Not only does this produce an unusual appearance, but it also complicates chewing of food. Lacrimation and taste may not be affected if the lesion remains distal to the greater petrosal and chorda tympani branches that originate deep in the temporal bone. In the clinic Trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) is a complex sensory disorder of the sensory root of the trigeminal nerve. Typically the pain is in the region of the mandibular [V3] and maxillary [V2] nerves, and is usually of sudden onset, is excruciating in nature, and may be triggered by touching a sensitive region of skin."
