They help maintain the osmotic pressure within the vascular system and also serve as carrier proteins for various substances such as copper (by ceruloplasmin), iron (by transferrin), and the protein hemoglobin (by haptoglobin). Nonimmune globulins also include fibronectin, lipoproteins, coagulation factors, and other molecules that may exchange between the blood and the extravascular connective tissue. Fibrinogen, the largest plasma protein (340 kilodaltons), is made in the liver. In a series of cascade reactions with other coagulation factors, soluble fibrinogen is transformed into the insoluble protein fibrin (323 kilodaltons). During conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, fibrinogen chains are broken to produce fibrin monomers that rapidly polymerize to form long fibers. These fibers become cross-linked to form an impermeable net at the site of damaged blood vessels, thereby preventing further blood loss."

Bilirubin is bound to albumin in the circulation and sent to the liver. In the liver, it is conjugated to glucuronic acid to form bilirubin diglucuronide in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme glucuronyl transferase, making it water soluble. This glucuro-nide is then excreted into the bile canaliculi. A small amount dissolves in the blood and is then excreted in the urine. The majority of conjugated bilirubin is excreted in the intestine as waste because the intestinal mucosa is relatively impermeable to conjugated bilirubin.

Under normal circumstances, bilirubin is removed from the circulation rapidly and efficiently by hepatocytes. Transfer of bilirubin from blood to bile involves four distinct but interrelated steps (Fig. 359-1). 1. Hepatocellular uptake: Uptake of bilirubin by the hepatocyte has carrier-mediated kinetics. Although a number of candidate bilirubin transporters have been proposed, the actual transporter remains elusive. 2. Intracellular binding: Within the hepatocyte, bilirubin is kept in solution by binding as a nonsubstrate ligand to several of the glutathione-S-transferases, formerly called ligandins. 3."

Just as thrombin is the key protease enzyme of the coagulation system, plasmin is the major protease enzyme of the fibrinolytic system, acting to digest fibrin to fibrin degradation products. The general scheme of fibrinolysis and its control is shown in Fig. 78-4."

            "content": "The liver is responsible for the production of numerous proteins, including those of the clotting cascade. Any disorder of the liver (including infection and cirrhosis) may decrease the production of these proteins and so prevent adequate blood clotting. Patients with severe cirrhosis of the liver have a significant risk of serious bleeding, even from small cuts; in addition, when varices rupture, there is a danger of rapid exsanguination. As the liver progressively fails, the patient develops salt and water retention, which produces skin and subcutaneous edema. Fluid (ascites) is also retained in the peritoneal cavity, which can hold many liters. The poorly functioning liver cells (hepatocytes) are unable to break down blood and blood products, leading to an increase in the serum bilirubin level, which manifests as jaundice."

Inhibiting tissue factor pathway inhibitor Correct answer = B. Thrombin bound to thrombomodulin activates protein C that degrades the accessory proteins FV and FVIII, thereby inhibiting clotting. Activation of FXIII by thrombin strengthens the fibrin clot. Nitric oxide, a vasodilator made by endothelial cells, decreases clot formation. It is not affected by thrombin. Thrombin is a powerful activator of platelets. Inhibition of tissue factor pathway inhibitor would increase clotting. 5.15. A student is reviewing the use of prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in evaluating a suspected deficiency of a clotting protein. Which one of the following results would be correct for a deficiency in FXIII? A. Both prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time are decreased."

            "content": "The central mechanism of DIC is the uncontrolled generation of thrombin by exposure of the blood to pathologic levels of tissue factor (Fig. 141-3). Simultaneous suppression of physiologic anticoagulant mechanisms and abnormal fibrinolysis further accelerate the process. Together, these abnormalities contribute to systemic fibrin deposition in small and midsize vessels. The duration and intensity of the fibrin deposition can compromise the blood supply of many organs, especially the lung, kidney, liver, and brain, with consequent organ failure. The sustained activation of coagulation results in consumption of clotting factors and platelets, which in turn leads to"

            "content": "Bilirubin, unique to mammals, appears to function at low levels as an antioxidant. In this role, it is oxidized to biliverdin, which is then reduced by biliverdin reductase, regenerating bilirubin. 2. Bilirubin uptake by the liver: Because bilirubin is only slightly soluble in plasma, it is transported through blood to the liver by binding noncovalently to albumin. [Note: Certain anionic drugs, such as salicylates and sulfonamides, can displace bilirubin from albumin, permitting bilirubin to enter the central nervous system (CNS). This causes the potential for neural damage in infants (see p. 285).] Bilirubin dissociates from the carrier albumin molecule, enters a hepatocyte via facilitated diffusion, and binds to intracellular proteins, particularly the protein ligandin. 3."
