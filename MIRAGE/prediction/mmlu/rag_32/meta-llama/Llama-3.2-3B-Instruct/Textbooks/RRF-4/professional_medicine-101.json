    "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for her first influenza virus vaccination. She has a history of untreated hypertension. Her blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min. Shortly after administration of the influenza virus vaccine, she develops shortness of breath, hives, and angioedema. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented this reaction?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the symptoms presented by the 67-year-old woman after receiving the influenza virus vaccine. The symptoms of shortness of breath, hives, and angioedema are indicative of an allergic reaction. Given the timing of the reaction, it is likely that the vaccine is the cause of the allergic reaction. We need to identify which of the provided options would have prevented this reaction.\\n\\nThe first option, A. Inquiry about an egg allergy, is a relevant consideration because some influenza vaccines are produced using chicken eggs. If the patient has an egg allergy, it could have been identified through this inquiry, and alternative vaccines could have been considered.\\n\\nThe second option, B. Heterophile agglutination test, is a diagnostic test used to detect the presence of certain bacteria, such as those causing Lyme disease. It is not relevant to identifying allergic reactions to vaccines.\\n\\nThe third option, C. Skin test with histamine reagent, is used to diagnose allergies, but it is not typically used to assess the risk of allergic reactions to vaccines.\\n\\nThe fourth option, D. \\u03b2-Adrenergic blocking agent therapy, is a treatment for hypertension, which is the patient's underlying condition. It is not relevant to preventing allergic reactions to vaccines.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely option to have prevented this reaction is A. Inquiry about an egg allergy, as it would have identified the patient's egg allergy and allowed for alternative vaccination options or precautions to be taken.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"A\"}",

His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema?

This expanded recommendation reflects increased recognition of previously unappreciated risk factors (e.g., obesity, postpartum conditions, and racial or ethnic influences) as well as an appreciation that more widespread use of vaccine is required for influenza control. Inactivated vaccines may be administered safely to immunocompromised patients. Influenza vaccination is not associated with exacerbations of chronic nervous system diseases such"

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

            "content": "In addition to a seasonal increase in incidence after natural influenza outbreaks, the administration of the A/New Jersey (swine) influenza vaccine, given in the United States in late 1976, brought attention to a slight increase in postvaccinal incidence of GBS. Several, but not most subsequent influenza vaccination programs have been associated with a marginal increase in cases. Representative was the widely publicized worldwide H1N1 vaccination program, in which the calculated risk of developing GBS after vaccination was in the range 2 cases per 1 million doses of vaccine, barely above the baseline rate and appearing mostly in individuals over 50 years (De Wals et al). GBS appears in temporal relationship to almost all other vaccinations, but the association in these instances may be idiosyncratic and infrequent. Trauma and surgical operations may precede the neuropathy, but a causal association to them also remains uncertain."

Most individuals who die in this setting have underlying diseases that place them at high risk for complications of influenza (Table 224-2). On average, there were 226,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations per year in the United States in 1979\u20132001. Recently, the moderately severe influenza season in 2012\u20132013 was associated with 381,500 hospitalizations (42 per 100,000 persons). Excess annual hospitalizations for groups of adults and children with high-risk medical conditions ranged from 40 to 1900 per 100,000 during outbreaks of influenza in 1973\u20132004. The most prominent high-risk conditions are chronic cardiac and pulmonary diseases and old age. Mortality rates among individuals with chronic metabolic or renal diseases or certain immunosuppressive diseases have also been elevated, although they remain lower than mortality rates among"
