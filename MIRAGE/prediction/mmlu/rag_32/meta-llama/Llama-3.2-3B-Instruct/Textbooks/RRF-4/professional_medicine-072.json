Diabetes can lead to vascular disease of large and medium arteries, narrowing the lumen and reducing blood supply to the extremities, thereby impairing healing. In addition, diabetes can also affect blood supply to nerves, which leads to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy results in reduced sensation, and therefore minor injuries can often go unnoticed. This patient has developed an ulcer on his heel, which is a pressure point and likely to be under repeated strain. The nurse examined the ulcer and found that the ulcer was looking infected with pus at the base of the ulcer and asked for a specialist orthopedic opinion, who requested an x-ray and an MRI. The MRI and x-ray both demonstrated infection invading into the calcaneus with destruction of the bone (Fig. 6.141A,B)."

Preoperative evaluation should include examination of the skin and urine sediment to detect asymptomatic infection. Wound infections, skin infections, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections account for two-thirds of the postoperative complications in patients with diabetes (151). There is a known predisposition for patients with DM to have increased colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, increased infections by gram-negative and staphylococcal bacteria, and an increased incidence of gram-negative and group B streptococcal sepsis (157\u2013159). Seven percent of individuals with diabetes will have postoperative gram-negative sepsis, a rate approximately seven times higher than that of the nondiabetic population. These complications occur more often in patients with poor glucose control, probably caused by impaired leukocyte function in the presence of hyperglycemia (160,161). Individuals with DM"

Etiologies are as follows: Dry gangrene: Due to insufficient blood \ufb02ow to tissue, typically from atherosclerosis. Wet gangrene: Involves bacterial infection, usually with skin \ufb02 ora. Gas gangrene: Due to Clostridium perfringens infection. Dry gangrene: Early signs are a dull ache, cold, and pallor of the \ufb02 esh. As necrosis sets in, the tissue (usually a toe) becomes bluish-black, dry, and shriveled. Diabetes, vasculopathy, and smoking are risk factors. Wet gangrene: The tissue appears bruised, swollen, or blistered with pus. Gas gangrene: Typically occurs at a site of recent injury or surgery, presenting with swelling around the injury and with skin that turns pale and then dark red. Bacteria are rapidly destructive of tissue, producing gas that separates healthy tissue and exposes it to infection. A medical emergency."

            "content": "The incubation period for traumatic gas gangrene can be as short as 6 h and is usually <4 days. The infection is characterized by the sudden onset of excruciating pain at the affected site and the rapid development of a foul-smelling wound containing a thin serosanguineous discharge and gas bubbles. Brawny edema and induration develop and give way to cutaneous blisters containing bluish to maroon-colored fluid. Such tissue later may become liquefied and slough. The margin between healthy and necrotic tissue often advances several inches per hour despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, and radical amputation remains the single best life-saving intervention. Shock and organ failure frequently accompany gas gangrene; when patients become bacteremic, the mortality rate exceeds 50%."

A revision of this categorization in 2010 excluded spe-cific diagnoses such as bite wounds, decubitus ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, perirectal abscesses, and necrotizing fasciitis. The general division into \u201cuncomplicated\u201d and \u201ccomplicated\u201d skin infections can be applied to help guide management.79 The agent most commonly responsible for skin and soft tissue infections is S aureus and is isolated in 44% of spec-imens.80 Less common isolates include other gram-positive bacteria such as Enterococcus species (9%), \u03b2-hemolytic strep-tococci (4%), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (3%). S aureus is more commonly responsible for causing abscesses. Patients with an impaired immune system (diabetic, cirrhotic, or neutropenic patients) are at higher risk of infection from gram-negative species like Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%), Esche-richia coli (7.2%), Enterobacter (5%), Klebsiella (4%), and"

It is usually polymicrobial. Patients will present with a necrotic digit that is purulent and very malodorous, with rapidly evolving pain, swelling, skin discoloration, and systemic collapse. Emergent treatment is the same as for other necrotizing infections, and amputation of the involved digit or extremity must often be performed.Infectious Flexor TenosynovitisFlexor tenosynovitis (FTS) is a severe pathophysiologic state causing disruption of normal flexor tendon function in the hand. A variety of etiologies are responsible for this process. Most acute cases of FTS are due to purulent infection. FTS also can occur secondary to chronic inflammation as a result of diabetes, RA, crystalline deposition, overuse syndromes, amyloidosis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and"

The most frequently isolated anaerobes in these infections are Peptostreptococcus and Bacteroides species. Gas may be found in the tissues. Similarly, myonecrosis can be associated with mixed anaerobic infection. Fournier\u2019s gangrene consists of cellulitis involving the scrotum, perineum, and anterior abdominal wall, with mixed anaerobic organisms spreading along deep external fascial planes and causing extensive loss of skin."
