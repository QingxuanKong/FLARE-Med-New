The supraorbital foramen, infraorbital foramen, and mental foramen are all small openings in the skull that can be palpated during a physical examination. The supraorbital foramen is located at the top of the eye socket, the infraorbital foramen is located below the eye, and the mental foramen is located in the lower jaw. All three of these structures can be palpated by a healthcare professional during a physical examination, but it's essential to be gentle and careful to avoid causing discomfort or pain to the patient. The key is to identify the location of these small openings and gently press on the surrounding area to feel for the bony structure. The other options, such as the zygomatic arch or the zygomatic bone, may be palpated, but the supraorbital, infraorbital, and mental foramina are specifically mentioned as examples of bony structures that can be palpated in a live patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

At all times the examiner should know what structures are being palpated (Fig. 10-2). Localized tenderness is seldom pronounced in disease of the spine because the involved structures are so deep. Nevertheless, tenderness over a spinous process or jarring by gentle percussion may indicate the presence of local spinal inflammation (as in disc space infection), pathologic or traumatic compression fracture, metastasis, epidural abscess, or a disc lesion."

Importantly, the skin is tented upward by the needle as the needle is slowly advanced horizontally and subdermally. D. Once the needle is completely inserted, the lever on the top of the device is pulled backward toward the operator. This retracts the needle and thereby deposits the implant. The device is then lifted away from the skin. After placement, both patient and operator should palpate the 4-cm implant. patient and provider should palpate and identiY both ends of the 4-cm implant. To minimize bruising at the site, a pressure ban dage is created around the arm and is removed the following day."

MRI is useful for evaluating soft tissue tumor involvement (e.g., which muscle compartments are involved) as well as intramedullary lesions. Most soft tissue tumors will appear dark on T1-weighted images and bright on T2-weighted images. Hematomas, hemangiomas, lipomas, liposarcomas, and adipose tissue will appear bright on T1-weighted images and dark on T2-weighted images. Scintigraphy uses methylene diphosphonate attached to technetium-99m. This complex will attach to hydroxyapatite. Immediate uptake is seen in areas of increased vascularity, such as infection, trauma, and neoplasia. Increased uptake 2"

            "content": "Palpation While the patient is seated, each breast should be palpated methodically. Some physicians recommend palpating the breast in long strips, but the exact palpation technique used is probably not as important as the thoroughness of its application over the entire breast. One very effective method is to palpate the breast in enlarging concentric circles until the entire breast is covered. A pendulous breast can be palpated by placing one hand between the breast and the chest wall and gently palpating the breast between both examining hands. The axillary and supraclavicular areas should be palpated for enlarged lymph nodes. The entire axilla, the upper outer quadrant of the breast, and the axillary tail of Spence are palpated for possible masses. While the patient is supine with one arm over her head, the ipsilateral breast is again methodically palpated from the clavicle to the costal margin and from the sternum to the latissimus dorsi laterally. If the breast is large, a pillow"
