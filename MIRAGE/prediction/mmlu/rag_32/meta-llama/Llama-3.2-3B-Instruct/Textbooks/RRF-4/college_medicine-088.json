    "question": "A dentist that is performing procedures in his clinic is brought out to the front desk one day to handle a dispute between one of his patients and the clerk. The patient is a middle-aged businessman who is irate and creating a scene because he was told he would have to see the dental hygienist instead of the dentist. The patient loudly rants that he makes too much money to be subjected to treatment by a half-trained associate. The clerk explains to the dentist that the patient was 40 minutes late to his appointment, and the only opening now was with the hygienist. The patient snaps back that his time is worth more than any of the people in the office. What personality disorder is this patient likely exhibiting?",

The patient is being overly demanding, feeling entitled to see the dentist, and is creating a scene when he is told that he has to see the dental hygienist instead. He also makes a statement that his time is worth more than anyone in the office, which suggests an inflated sense of self-importance. These behaviors are characteristic of a narcissistic personality disorder, which is characterized by a grandiose sense of self-importance, a fixation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love, and a need for constant admiration. The patient's behavior in this scenario is a classic example of these characteristics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

One study revealed that many primary care physicians, feeling that they have too little time or training to assess psychological symptoms, tend to minimize verbal interactions with patients and to rely on the prescription of psychotropic medications (17). Allowing a few moments for open-ended discussion does not mean that the physician and the other patients awaiting care are to be held hostage by an overly talkative patient. The clinician can tell the patient with multiple, detailed symptoms how much time is available for the current appointment, invite her to focus on her most pressing problem, and offer a future appointment to continue the account."

To communicate effectively and compassionately, it is helpful to pursue an organized process similar to the structured history and physical central to the evaluation of any patient. One such structured approach to delivering unfavorable news proposes six steps that can be easily learned by clinicians: (a) getting started by selection of the appropriate setting, introductions, and seating; (b) determining what the patient or family knows; (c) determining what the patient or family wants to know; (d) giving the information; (e) expressing empathy; and (f) establishing expectations, planning, and aftercare (Table 48-3).43 Success with this approach to breaking bad news is critically depen-dent upon the clinician\u2019s ability to empathically respond to the patient\u2019s (and"
