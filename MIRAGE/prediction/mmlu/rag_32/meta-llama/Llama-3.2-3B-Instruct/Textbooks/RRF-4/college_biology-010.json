The key concept here is cleavage symmetry and its relationship with the polar axis. According to Document [2], the zygote undergoes slow cleavage for 3 days while still remaining in the fallopian tube. As the blastomeres continue to divide, a solid mulberry-like ball of cells-the morula-is produced. The morula enters the uterine cavity approximately 3 days after fertilization. The documents do not explicitly define cleavage symmetry in relation to the polar axis, but they do describe the process of cleavage and the formation of the morula. However, in Document [12], it is mentioned that in the frog embryo, patterning must be mediated by extracellular signal molecules, and the endoderm derives from the most vegetal blastomeres (yellow), the ectoderm from the most animal (blue), and the mesoderm from a middle set (green) that contributes also to endoderm and ectoderm. This suggests that the cleavage pattern in the frog embryo is radial, with the blastomeres arranged in a radial pattern. Based on this information, we can infer that radial cleavage is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

This asymmetric inheritance ensures that the two daughter cells develop differently (Figure 21\u201312). Asymmetric division is a common feature of early development, where the fertilized egg already has an internal pattern and cleavage of this large cell segregates different determinants into separate blastomeres. We shall see that asymmetric division also plays a part in some later developmental processes. Initial patterns are established in Small Fields of cells and refined by Sequential Induction as the embryo Grows"

A frog, a chicken, and a mammal, for example, even though they develop in similar ways later, make eggs that differ radically in size and structure, and they begin their development with different sequences of cell divisions and cell specializations. Gastrulation occurs in all animal embryos, but the details of its timing, of the associated pattern of cell movements, and of the shape and size of the embryo as gastrulation proceeds are highly variable. Likewise, there is great variation in the time and manner in which the primary axes of the body become marked out. However, this polarization of the embryo usually becomes discernible very early, before gastrulation begins: it is the first step of spatial patterning."

Some cells undergo multiple rounds of nuclear division without intervening cytoplasmic division. In the early Drosophila embryo, for example, the first 13 rounds of nuclear division occur without cytoplasmic division, resulting in the formation of a single large cell containing several thousand nuclei, arranged in a monolayer near the surface. A cell in which multiple nuclei share the same cytoplasm is called a syncytium. This arrangement greatly speeds up early development, as the cells do not have to take the time to go through all the steps of cytokinesis for each division. After these rapid nuclear divisions, membranes are created around each nucleus in one round of coordinated cytokinesis called cellularization. The plasma membrane extends inward and, with the help of an actin\u2013 myosin ring, pinches off to enclose each nucleus (Figure 17\u201351)."

In the wing of a fly, for example, each epithelial cell has a tiny asymmetrical projection, called a wing hair, on its surface, and the hairs all point toward the tip of the wing. Similarly, in the inner ear of a vertebrate, each mechanosensory hair cell has a precisely oriented asymmetric bundle of actin-filled, rodlike protrusions called stereocilia sticking up from its apical plasma membrane as a detector of sound and of forces such as gravity.

Cell locomotion requires an initial polarization of the cell to set it off in a particular direction. Carefully controlled cell-polarization processes are also required for oriented cell divisions in tissues and for formation of a coherent, organized multicellular structure. Genetic studies in yeast, flies, and worms have provided most of our current understanding of the molecular basis of cell polarity. The mechanisms that generate cell polarity in vertebrates are only beginning to be explored. In all known cases, however, the cytoskeleton has a central role, and many of the molecular components have been evolutionarily conserved."

To create daughter cells with different fates in this way, the mother cell must first segregate certain components (called cell fate determinants) to one side of the cell and then position the plane of division so that the appropriate daughter cell inherits these components (Figure 17\u201350). To position the plane of division asymmetrically, the spindle has to be moved in a controlled manner within the dividing cell. It seems likely that changes in local regions of the cell cortex direct such spindle movements and that motor proteins localized there pull one of the spindle poles, via its astral microtubules, to the appropriate region. Genetic analyses in C. elegans and Drosophila have identified some of the proteins required for such asymmetric divisions, and some of these proteins seem to have a similar role in vertebrates."

            "content": "We shall see that the initial patterning of the Drosophila embryo depends on signals that diffuse through the cytoplasm at the syncytial stage and exert their actions on genes in the rapidly dividing nuclei, before the partitioning of the egg into separate cells. Here, there is no need for the usual forms of cell\u2013cell signaling; neighboring regions of the syncytial blastoderm can communicate by means of transcription regulatory proteins that move through the cytoplasm of the giant multinuclear cell. egg-polarity Genes encode Macromolecules Deposited in the egg to Organize the axes of the early Drosophila embryo As in most insects, the main axes of the future body of Drosophila are defined before fertilization by a complex exchange of signals between the developing egg, Figure 21\u201315 Development of the Drosophila egg from fertilization to the cellular blastoderm stage."

            "content": "C. elegans. The fertilized egg is shown in the left micrographs and the two daughter cells in the right micrographs. The cells above have been stained with a blue, dna-binding, fluorescent dye to show the nucleus (and polar bodies); they are viewed by both differential-interference-contrast and fluorescence microscopy. The cells below are the same cells stained with an antibody against p-granules and viewed by fluorescence microscopy. These small granules are made of Rna and proteins and determine which cells become germ cells. They are distributed randomly throughout the cytoplasm of the unfertilized egg (not shown) but become segregated to the posterior pole of the fertilized egg. The cleavage plane is oriented to ensure that only the posterior daughter cell receives the p-granules when the egg divides. The same segregation process is repeated in several subsequent cell divisions, so that the p-granules end up only in cells that give rise to eggs and sperm. (Courtesy of susan"

            "content": "Embryo Development Initial embryo development is typically assessed 15 to 20 hours after insemination or ICSI, when fertilization is characterized by the presence of two pronuclei and the extrusion of the second polar body (9,361,362). Embryos are examined again for cleavage after 24 to 30 hours of culture (9). The first embryo cleavage occurs approximately 21 hours after fertilization, and subsequent divisions occur every 12 to 15 hours up to the eight-cell stage on the 3rd day of embryo development (363). Compaction to form the 16-cell morula occurs on the 4th day of embryo development, and differentiation of the inner cell mass and trophectoderm to form a blastocyst (containing a \ufb02uid-filled area called a blastocele) is completed by the 5th or 6th day (364,365)."
