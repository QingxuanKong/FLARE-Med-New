    "question": "A 46-year-old man with Marfan syndrome, aortic insufficiency, and mitral regurgitation comes to the emergency department because he has had severe substernal chest pain for the past 3 hours. He describes the pain as tearing in quality and radiating to the neck. One week earlier he experienced similar but less severe chest pain and treated himself with aspirin.

The patient also has aortic insufficiency and mitral regurgitation, which are both complications of aortic root dilation. The patient's symptoms of severe substernal chest pain radiating to the neck, which worsened over time, are consistent with aortic dissection. This is a medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. The patient's history of similar but less severe chest pain one week earlier, which was treated with aspirin, suggests a possible acute aortic dissection. The tearing quality of the pain is also consistent with aortic dissection. The patient's age and Marfan syndrome make him more susceptible to aortic dissection. The correct answer is C.

Acute aortic syndromes involving the ascending aorta tend to cause pain in the midline of the anterior chest, whereas descending aortic syndromes most often present with pain in the back. Therefore, dissections that begin in the ascending aorta and extend to the descending aorta tend to cause pain in the front of the chest that extends toward the back, between the shoulder blades. Proximal aortic dissections that involve the ascending aorta (type A in the Stanford nomenclature) are at high risk for major complications that may influence the clinical presentation, including (1) compromise of the aortic ostia of the coronary arteries, resulting in MI; (2) disruption of the aortic valve, causing acute aortic insufficiency; and (3) rupture of the hematoma into the pericardial space, leading to pericardial"

He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain.

Nontraumatic aortic dissections are very rare in the absence of hypertension or conditions associated with deterioration of the elastic or muscular components of the aortic media, including pregnancy, bicuspid aortic disease, or inherited connective tissue diseases, such as Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. Although aortic aneurysms are most often asymptomatic, thoracic aortic aneurysms can cause chest pain and other symptoms by compressing adjacent structures. This pain tends to be steady, deep, and occasionally severe. Aortitis, whether of noninfectious or infectious etiology, in the absence of aortic dissection is a rare cause of chest or back discomfort."

The presentations of aortic dissection and its variants are the consequences of intimal tear, dissecting hematoma, occlusion of involved arteries, and compression of adjacent tissues. Acute aortic dissection presents with the sudden onset of pain (Chap. 19), which often is described as very severe and tearing and is associated with diaphoresis. The pain may be localized to the front or back of the chest, often the interscapular region, and typically migrates with propagation of the dissection. Other symptoms include syncope, dyspnea, and weakness. Physical findings may include hypertension or hypotension, loss of pulses, aortic regurgitation, pulmonary edema, and neurologic findings due to carotid artery obstruction (hemiplegia, hemianesthesia) or spinal cord ischemia (paraplegia).

However, pain that is highly localized\u2014e.g., that which can be demarcated by the tip of one finger\u2014is highly unusual for angina.

Angina may also occur in an epigastric location. However, pain that occurs solely above the mandible or below the epigastrium is rarely angina.

The variety of presentations can make myocardial ischemia challenging to diagnose. Characteristics of chest pain that make myocardial ischemia less likely include pleuritic chest pain, pain reproduc-ible by movement or palpation, or brief episodes lasting only seconds. Typical angina is relieved by rest and/or use of sub-lingual nitroglycerin. Differential diagnoses to be considered include, but are not limited to, musculoskeletal pain, pulmonary disorders, esophageal spasm, pericarditis, aortic dissection, gas-troesophageal reflux, neuropathic pain, and anxiety.Myocardial infarction is a serious"

Pleuritic discomfort is suggestive of a process involving the pleura, including pericarditis, pulmonary embolism, or pulmonary parenchymal processes. Less frequently, the pain of pericarditis or massive pulmonary embolism is a steady severe pressure or aching that can be difficult to discriminate from myocardial ischemia. \u201cTearing\u201d or \u201cripping\u201d pain is often described by patients with acute aortic dissection. However, acute aortic emergencies also present commonly with severe, knifelike pain. A burning quality can suggest acid reflux or peptic ulcer disease but may also occur with myocardial ischemia. Esophageal pain, particularly with spasm, can be a severe squeezing discomfort identical to angina."

If a patient is hypotensive, consider pericardial tamponade, hypovolemia from blood loss, or acute MI from involvement of the coronary arteries. Asymmetric pulses and BP measurements are indicative of aortic dissection. Signs of pericarditis or pericardial tamponade may be seen; a murmur of aortic regurgitation may be heard if the aortic valve is involved with a proximal dissection. Neurologic deficits may be seen if the aortic arch or spinal arteries are involved. ECG, CXR (shows widening of the mediastinum, cardiomegaly, or new left pleural effusion). CT angiography is the gold standard of imaging. TEE can provide details of the thoracic aorta, the proximal coronary arteries, the origins of arch vessels, the presence of a pericardial effusion, and aortic valve integrity."
