The calvaria is the dome-shaped roof that protects the superior aspect of the brain. It consists mainly of the frontal bone anteriorly, the paired parietal bones in the middle, and the occipital bone posteriorly (Fig. 8.24). Sutures visible internally include: the coronal suture, between the frontal and parietal bones, the sagittal suture, between the paired parietal bones, and the lambdoid suture, between the parietal and occipital bones. Visible junctions of these sutures are the bregma, where the coronal and sagittal sutures meet, and the lambda, where the lambdoid and sagittal sutures meet. Other markings on the internal surface of the calva include bony ridges and numerous grooves and pits."

Such conditions are estimated to occur in 1 of every 1,000 births, with predominance in males (Lyon and Evrard). The growth of the cranium is inhibited in a direction perpendicular to the involved suture(s), creating a compensatory enlargement in other dimensions as allowed by the patent sutures. For example, when the lambdoid and coronal sutures are both affected, the thrust of the growing brain enlarges the head in a vertical direction (tower skull, or oxycephaly, also referred to as turricephaly and acrocephaly). The orbits are shallow, the eyes bulge, and imaging of the skull shows islands of bone thinning (l\u00fcckensch\u00e4del).

Sutures like this should be removed within the first week. If the superficial sutures are placed more shallowly in the dermis, there is a reduced tendency to form additional scarring. A subcuticular suture may be used instead of simple sutures.

Suturing of the hepatic parenchyma with a blunt tipped 0 chromic suture (e.g., a \u201cliver suture\u201d) can be an effective hemostatic technique. A running suture is used to approximate the edges of shal-low lacerations, whereas deeper lacerations are approximated using interrupted horizontal mattress sutures placed parallel to the edge of the laceration. When the suture is tied, tension is adequate when visible hemorrhage ceases or the liver blanches around the suture. Caution must be used to prevent hepatic necrosis. This technique of placing large liver sutures controls bleeding through reapproximation of the liver laceration rather than direct ligation of bleeding vessels. Aggressive finger frac-ture to identify bleeding vessels followed by individual clip or suture ligation was advocated previously but currently has a limited role in hemostasis. Hepatic lobar arterial ligation may be appropriate for patients with"

The numbers denote the sequential path of the suture and are shown in more than one figure. Step 1. Beginning below the incision, the needle pierces the lower uterine segment to enter the uterine cavity. Step 2. The needle exits the cavity above the incision. The suture then loops up and around the fundus to the posterior uterine surface. Step 3. The needle pierces the posterior uterine wall to reenter the uterine cavity. The suture then traverses to the opposite side within the cavity. Step 4. The needle exits the uterine cavity through the posterior uterine wall. From the back of the uterus, the suture loops up and around the fundus to the front of the uterus. Step 5. The needle pierces the myometrium above the incision to reenter the uterine cavity. Step 6. The needle exits below the incision and"

            "content": "This is a benefit of open reduction and internal fixation because prolonged MMF is associated with gingival and dental disease, as well as with significant weight loss and malnutrition, during the fixation period. After fixation, the fracture is exposed, more commonly from a transcervical compared to a transoral approach. Care is made not to injure the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve during this exposure. A rigid, locking, load-bearing mandibular plate is used. In edentulous patients, determining the baseline occlusion is of less significance because dentures may be refashioned once healing is complete.Midface fractures are rarely isolated and include multiple subsites. However, isolated zygoma fractures are typically dis-placed inferior inferiorly and medially with disruption of the suture lines between the temporal, frontal, and maxillary bones and the zygoma. If multiple zygoma fractures are present or if the zygomatic arch is significantly displaced, a coronal"

Note that a sagittal plane passing through the midline may also be referred to as a midsagittal section, whereas a section taken just lateral to the midline is referred to as a parasagittal section."
