However, ventilatory support during CPR has yielded to evidence that continuous chest compressions (\u201chands only\u201d CPR) results in better outcomes. Compressions are interrupted only for single shocks from an AED when available, with 2 min of CPR between each single shock."

            "content": "Children who need cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) usually have a primary respiratory arrest. Hypoxia usually initiates the cascade leading to arrest and also produces organ dysfunction or damage (Table 38-3). The approach to cardiopulmonary arrest extends beyond CPR and includes efforts to preserve vital organ function. The goal in resuscitating a pediatric patient following a cardiopulmonary arrest should be to optimize cardiac output and tissue oxygen delivery, which may be accomplished by using artificial ventilation and chest compression and by the judicious administration of pharmacologic agents. In 2010 the American Heart Association revised the recommendations for resuscitation for adults, children, and infants. The biggest change is the recommendation to start chest compressions immediately, rather than beginning with airway and breathing."

For this reason the recommendation is to start chest compressions first while preparing for ventilation. For optimal chest compressions, the child should be supine on a flat, hard surface. Effective CPR requires a compression depth of one third to one half of the anterior-posterior diameter of the chest with complete recoil after each compression. The compression rate should be at least 100/min with breaths delivered 8 to 10 times per minute. If an advanced airway is in place, compressions should not pause for ventilation; both should continue simultaneously."

Because hypoxemia is the final common pathway in pediatric cardiopulmonary arrests, providing oxygen is more important than correcting the respiratory acidosis. The clinician should deliver 100% oxygen at a rate of 8 to 10 breaths/min during CPR, or 12 to 20 breaths/min for a patient who has a perfusing rhythm. Use only the tidal volume necessary to produce visible chest rise. Care should be taken not to hyperventilate the patient. When mechanical means fail to re-establish adequate circulation, pharmacologic intervention is essential (Table 38-4).If intravascular access is not present or rapidly established, administration through an intraosseous route is recommended.

Pplateau is not measured routinely with each delivered tidal vol-ume but rather is measured intermittently by setting the ventilator to close the exhalation circuit briefly at the end of inspiration and record the airway pressure when airflow is zero.If both Ppeak and Pplateau are increased (and tidal volume is not excessive), then the problem is a decrease in the compli-ance in the lung/chest wall unit. Common causes of this problem include pneumothorax, hemothorax, lobar atelectasis, pulmo-nary edema, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), active contraction of the chest wall or diaphragmatic muscles, abdominal distention, and intrinsic PEEP, such as occurs in patients with bronchospasm and insufficient expira-tory times.

            "content": "ACLS is intended to achieve and maintain organ perfusion and adequate ventilation, control cardiac arrhythmias, and stabilize blood pressure and cardiac output. The activities carried out to achieve these goals include (1) defibrillation/cardioversion and/or pacing, (2) intubation with an endotracheal tube, and (3) insertion of an intravenous line. As in basic life support, the major emphasis during ACLS is minimizing interruptions of chest compressions until ROSC is achieved. After two or three unsuccessful defibrillation attempts, epinephrine, 1 mg IV, is given and attempts to defibrillate are repeated. The dose of epinephrine may be repeated after intervals of 3\u20135 min (Fig. 327-3A). Vasopressin (a single 40-unit dose given IV) has been suggested as an alternative to epinephrine."

In patients who cannot tolerate the test for more than a brief period because it produces hypotension, raising the arterial CO2 by insufflation of this gas has been suggested, but this approach has not been studied extensively. Delivering oxygen during the test with a low tidal volume and a ventilator rate of 1 to 2 breaths per minute or by continuous positive airway pressure may ameliorate hypoxia and resultant hypotension, but this technique has also not been adequately studied."

Unstable patients with penetrating thoracic injuries require immediate intubation followed by assessment and treatment of the life-threatening injuries described above. Empiric placement of bilateral chest tubes may be needed if the precise nature of injury is unclear. Open thoracotomy may be indicated for patients with penetrating chest trauma leading to cardiac arrest, provided that the patient arrested in the ED or shortly before arrival. Leave any impaled objects in place until the patient is taken to the OR, as such objects may tamponade further blood loss. Beware of tension pneumothorax, open pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, \ufb02ail chest, cardiac tamponade, aortic disruption, diaphragmatic tear, and esophageal injury. If a previously stable chest trauma patient suddenly dies, suspect air embolism."
