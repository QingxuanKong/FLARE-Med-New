The oral mucosa is composed of three main layers: the mucosa, the lamina propria, and the submucosa. The mucosa is further divided into masticatory mucosa and lining mucosa. In the area surrounding the alveolar process supporting the mandibular teeth, the mucosa is a type of masticatory mucosa. This type of mucosa is keratinized in some areas, but not in the region surrounding the teeth. The mucosa covering the alveolar process supporting the mandibular teeth is a type of mucosa that is not keratinized, as it is not subjected to the same level of friction and wear as the mucosa on the hard palate or the lips. The mucosa covering the alveolar process is more likely to be light pink in color, as it is not keratinized and is not subjected to the same level of wear and tear as the mucosa on other areas of the mouth. Considering the options provided, the most likely color of the mucosa covering the alveolar process supporting the mandibular teeth is light pink on both sides of the mucogingival junction.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The alveolar processes of the maxilla and mandible contain the sockets or alveoli for the roots of the teeth. The alveolar bone proper, a thin layer of compact bone, forms the wall of the alveolus (see Fig. 16.7) and is the bone to which the periodontal ligament is attached. The rest of the alveolar process consists of supporting bone. The surface of the alveolar bone proper usually shows regions of bone resorption and bone deposition, particularly when a tooth is being moved (Fig. 16.20). Periodontal disease usually leads to loss of alveolar bone, as does the absence of functional occlusion of a tooth with its normal opposing tooth."

In addition, saliva serves several other roles in protecting the teeth. Proteins in saliva cover the teeth with a protective coat called the acquired pellicle.

Patients whose salivary glands are irradiated, as in the treatment of salivary gland tumors, fail to produce normal amounts of saliva; these patients typically develop rampant caries.

            "content": "Proper oral and nasal hygiene and routine dental care are extremely important ways for patients to protect themselves from disorders of the mouth and nose that can ultimately result in chemosensory disturbance. Patients should be warned not to overcompensate for their taste loss by adding excessive amounts of sugar or salt. Smoking cessation and the discontinuance of oral tobacco use are essential in the management of any patient with smell and/or taste disturbance and should be repeatedly emphasized."

The three mineralized components of the tooth are dentin, enamel, and cementum. The central soft core of the tooth is the pulp. The periodontal ligament (membrane) contains bundles of collagenous fibers that bind the tooth to the surrounding alveolar bone. The clinical crown of the tooth is the portion that projects into the oral cavity. The anatomic crown is the entire portion of the tooth covered by enamel."
