The question provides information about the history of chromosome mapping, but it does not directly relate to the options provided. However, we can infer that the correct answer is related to the development of chromosome mapping techniques and their impact on the field. Option A is incorrect because it is not related to the topic of chromosome mapping. Option C is also incorrect because the number of linkage groups is equal to the number of chromosomes, not twice the number. Option D is incorrect because not all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes, as non-coding regions play important roles in regulating gene expression and other cellular processes. The correct answer is related to the advancement of technology and its impact on chromosome mapping. Option B is the most plausible answer because it suggests that the development of new technologies and techniques, such as large-scale sequencing, has greatly facilitated the mapping of human chromosomes. This is consistent with the text, which mentions the use of massive parallel sequencing technology in chromosome conformation capture and the development of array-based and sequencing technologies in the early 2000s. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

According to rough estimates, a total of about 180 breakage-and-rejoining events have occurred in the human and mouse lineages since these two species last shared a common ancestor. In the process, although the number of chromosomes is similar in the two species (23 per haploid genome in the human versus 20 in the mouse), their overall structures differ greatly. Nonetheless, even after the extensive genomic shuffling, there are many large blocks of DNA in which the gene order is the same in the human and the mouse. These stretches of conserved gene order in chromosomes are referred to as regions of synteny. Figure 4\u201367 illustrates how segments of the different mouse chromosomes map onto the human chromosome set. For much more distantly related vertebrates, such as chicken and human, the number of"

The results reveal that most regions of our chromosomes are folded into a conformation referred to as a fractal globule: a knot-free arrangement that facilitates maximally dense packing while, at the same time, preserving the ability of the chromatin fiber to unfold and fold (Figure 4\u201355).

Broken chromosomes tend to fuse end to end, whereas a normal chromosome with an intact telomere structure is stable. To create the standard chromosome-banding map, each chromosome is divided into segments that are numbered, and then further subdivided. The precise band names are recorded in an international document so that each band has a distinct number.

(A) Chromosome 22, one of the smallest human chromosomes, contains 48 \u00d7 106 nucleotide pairs and makes up approximately 1.5% of the human genome. most of the left arm of chromosome 22 consists of short repeated sequences of DNA that are packaged in a particularly compact form of chromatin (heterochromatin) discussed later in this chapter. (b) A tenfold expansion of a portion of chromosome 22, with about 40 genes indicated. Those in dark brown are known genes and those in red are predicted genes. (C) An expanded portion of (b) showing four genes. (D) The intron\u2013exon arrangement of a typical gene is shown after a further tenfold expansion. Each exon (red) codes for a portion of the protein, while the DNA sequence of the introns (gray) is relatively unimportant, as discussed in detail in Chapter 6."

            "content": "The first chromosome deletion syndromes were diagnosed clinically and were subsequently demonstrated to be caused by a chromosome deletion on cytogenetic analysis. Examples of these disorders include the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, which is associated with deletions of a small region of the short arm of chromosome 4 (4p); the cri-du-chat syndrome, associated with deletion of a small region of the short arm of chromosome 5 (5p); Williams syndrome, which is associated with interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q11.23); and the DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndromes, associated with interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q11.2). Initial cytogenetic studies were able to provide a rough localization of the deletions in different patients, but with the increased usage of arrays, precise mapping of the extent and gene content of these deletions has become much easier. In many cases, one or two genes that are critical for the phenotype associated with these"

            "content": "Observations in human cells also suggest that highly folded loops of chromatin expand to occupy an increased volume when a gene within them is expressed. For example, quiescent chromosome regions from 0.4 to 2 million nucleotide pairs in length appear as compact dots in an interphase nucleus when visualized by fluorescence microscopy. However, the same DNA is seen to occupy a larger territory when its genes are expressed, with elongated, punctate structures replacing the original dot. New ways of visualizing individual chromosomes have shown that each of the 46 interphase chromosomes in a human cell tends to occupy its own discrete ter- ritory within the nucleus: that is, the chromosomes are not extensively entangled with one another (Figure 4\u201353). However, pictures such as these present only an average view of the DNA in each chromosome. Experiments that specifically localize the heterochromatic regions of a chromosome reveal that they are often"

            "content": "1. Single-base changes: About 90% of human genome variation comes in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, pronounced \u201csnips\u201d), that is, variations that involve just one base (Fig. 34.14). The substitution of one nucleotide at a restriction site can render the site unrecognizable by a particular restriction endonuclease. A new restriction site can also be created by the same mechanism. In either case, cleavage with an endonuclease results in fragments of lengths that differ from the normal and can be detected by DNA hybridization (see Fig. 34.13). The altered restriction site can be either at the site of a disease-causing mutation (rare) or at a site some distance from the mutation. [Note: The HapMap, developed by The International Haplotype Map Project, is a catalog of common SNP in the human genome. The data are being used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify those alleles that affect health and disease.] 2. Tandem repeats: Polymorphisms in chromosomal"

The identification of the ~10 million SNPs estimated to occur in the human genome has generated a catalogue of common genetic variants that occur in human beings from distinct ethnic backgrounds (Fig. 82-3). SNPs are the most common type of sequence variation and account for ~90% of all sequence variation. They occur on average every 100 to 300 bases and are the major source of genetic heterogeneity. Remarkably, however, the primary DNA sequence of humans has ~99.9% similarity compared to that of any other human. SNPs that are in close proximity are inherited together (e.g., they are linked) and are referred to as haplotypes(Fig. 82-4). The HapMap describes the nature and location of these SNP haplotypes and how they are distributed among individuals within and among populations. The haplotype map information, referred to as HapMap, is greatly facilitating GWAS designed to elucidate the complex"
