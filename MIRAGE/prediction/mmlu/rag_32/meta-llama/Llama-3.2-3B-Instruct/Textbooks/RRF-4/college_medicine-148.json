    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider attachment theory and how it applies to the given scenarios. According to attachment theory, infants begin to form attachments to their caregivers based on their early experiences with them. A secure attachment is formed when the caregiver is responsive to the infant's needs and provides a safe and stable environment. In contrast, an insecure attachment is formed when the caregiver is unresponsive or neglectful. Given the options, we need to identify which child is most likely to form an insecure attachment, making them more likely to attach to a male psychologist in a study.\\n\\nOption A: A two month old female infant raised in a safe, stable environment is likely to form a secure attachment to her caregiver. She is too young to have formed an insecure attachment, and her environment is stable and responsive.\\n\\nOption B: A five month old male infant raised in a safe, stable environment is also likely to form a secure attachment to his caregiver. Like the two month old infant in Option A, he is young and in a stable environment.\\n\\nOption C: An eight month old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglects the child is likely to form an insecure attachment. The caregiver's neglectful behavior can lead to feelings of insecurity and anxiety in the child, making it more likely for the child to attach to a stranger, such as a male psychologist.\\n\\nOption D: A thirteen month old female infant raised by two caregivers who occasionally neglect the child is also likely to form an insecure attachment. The inconsistent caregiving can lead to feelings of uncertainty and insecurity in the child, making it more likely for the child to attach to a stranger.\\n\\nBased on attachment theory, the child most likely to attach to a male psychologist is either Option C or Option D. However, since the question asks for a single answer, we need to consider which of these two options is more likely to form an insecure attachment.\\n\\nConsidering the definitions of reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder, both of which involve an insecure attachment, we can infer that the child in Option C is more likely to form an insecure attachment due to the single caregiver's neglectful behavior, which is a diagnostic requirement for reactive attachment disorder. Disinhibited social engagement disorder is also characterized by an indiscriminate attachment to strangers, which is more likely to occur in the child in Option C.\\n\\nTherefore, the child most likely to attach to a male psychologist is the eight month old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglects the child, Option C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

In addition, their emotion regulation capacity is com- promised, and they display episodes of negative emotions of fear, sadness, or irritability that are not readily explained. A diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder should not be made in children who are developmentally unable to form selective attachments. For this reason, the child must have a developmental age of at least 9 months."

About half of these divorces occur in the first 10 years of marriage, so there are often young children in the family when the parents divorce. At least 25% of children experience the divorce or separation of their parents. Few events in childhood are as dramatic and challenging for the child as divorce. Divorce is likely to be accompanied by changes in behavioral and emotional adjustment. In the immediate post-divorce period, many children exhibit anger, noncompliance, anxiety, and depression. Children from divorced families require psychological help two to three times more frequently than children with married parents. Long-term studies suggest that in the absence of ongoing stressors, most children demonstrate good adjustment a few years after the divorce, but some have enduring difficulties."

The associated behaviors in grieving children of this age usually include protesting and difficulty of attachment to other adults. The degree of difficulty depends on the availability of other nurturing people with whom the child has had a good previous attachment. Children from 3 to 5 years of age (preoperational) (sometimes called the magic years) have trouble grasping the meaning of the illness and the permanence of the death. Their language skills at this age make understanding their moods and behavior difficult. Because of a developing sense of guilt, death may be viewed as punishment. If a child previously wished a younger sibling to have died, the death may be seen psychologically as being caused by the child\u2019s wishful thinking. They can feel overwhelmed when confronted with the strong emotional reactions of their parents."

The terms refer also to a person\u2019s concern or preoccupation with sex, erotic desires, or activities. A more ambiguous meaning has been proposed by some psychologists, for whom the term is equated with all growth and development, the experience of pleasure, and survival. Much of now discredited Freudian psychoanalytic theory centers on the sexual development of the child and, on the basis of questionable observations, espouses the view that repression of the sexual impulse and the psychic conflicts resulting therefrom are the main sources of neurosis and possibly psychosis."

Onset of separation anxiety disorder may be as early as preschool age and may occur at any time during child- hood and more rarely in adolescence. Typically there are periods of exacerbation and re- mission. In some cases, both the anxiety about possible separation and the avoidance of situations involving separation from the home or nuclear family (e.g., going away to col- lege, moving away from attachment figures) may persist through adulthood. However, the majority of children with separation anxiety disorder are free of impairing anxiety dis- orders over their lifetimes.

That is, signs of absent-to-minimal attachment behaviors and associated emotion- ally aberrant behaviors are evident in children throughout this age range, although differ- ing cognitive and motor abilities may affect how these behaviors are expressed. Without remediation and recovery through normative caregiving environments, it appears that signs of the disorder may persist, at least for several years. It is unclear whether reactive attachment disorder occurs in older children and, if so, how it differs from its presentation in young children. Because of this, the diagnosis should be made with caution in children older than 5 years."

William McDougall spoke of it as \u201can emotional state arising when a continuing strong desire seems likely to miss its goal.\u201d The primary emotion, somewhat muted perhaps, may be one of fear, and its arousal under conditions that are not overtly threatening may be explained as a conditioned response to some recondite component of a formerly threatening stimulus.

Infants who receive extra attention, such as parents responding immediately to any crying or fussiness, show less crying and fussiness at the end of the first year. Stranger anxiety develops between 9 and 18 months of age, when infants normally become insecure about separation from the primary caregiver. The infant\u2019s new motor skills and attraction to novelty may lead to headlong plunges into new adventures that result in fright or pain followed by frantic efforts to find and cling to the primary caregiver. The result is dramatic swings from stubborn independence to clinging dependence that can be frustrating and confusing to parents.

Such individuals may still be diagnosed with pedophilic disorder despite the absence of self-reported distress, provided that there is evidence of recurrent behaviors persisting for 6 months (Criterion A) and evidence that the individual has acted on sexual urges or experi- enced interpersonal difficulties as a consequence of the disorder (Criterion B)."

By 15 years of age, 4%of children in the United States experience the death of a parent. This experience is likely to alter forever the child\u2019s view of the world as a secure and safe place. Similar to theother separations, a child\u2019s cognitive development and temperament along with the available support systems affectthe child\u2019s adjustment after the death of a parent. Many ofthe recommendations in Table 26-1 are helpful. The deathof a parent or close family member also brings up someunique issues. Explaining Death to a Child"

            "content": "Disorder-specific scales are available to better characterize the severity of each anxiety disorder and to capture change in severity over time. For ease of use, particularly for in- dividuals with more than one anxiety disorder, these scales have been developed to have the same format (but different focus) across the anxiety disorders, with ratings of behav- ioral symptoms, cognitive ideation symptoms, and physical symptoms relevant to each disorder. Diagnostic Criteria 309.21 (F93.0) A. Developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from those to whom the individual is attached, as evidenced by at least three of the following: 1. Recurrent excessive distress when anticipating or experiencing separation from home or from major attachment figures. 2. Persistent and excessive worry about losing major attachment figures or about pos- sible harm to them, such as illness, injury, disasters, or death."

            "content": "The increased activity criterion can be difficult to ascertain in children; however, when the child takes on many tasks simultaneously, starts devising elaborate and unrealistic plans for projects, develops previously absent and developmentally inappropriate sexual preoccupations (not accounted for by sexual abuse or exposure to sexually explicit mate\u2014 rial), then Criterion B might be met based on clinical judgment. It is essential to determine whether the behavior represents a change from the child\u2019s baseline behavior; occurs most of the day, nearly every day for the requisite time period; and occurs in temporal associa- tion with other symptoms of mania."
