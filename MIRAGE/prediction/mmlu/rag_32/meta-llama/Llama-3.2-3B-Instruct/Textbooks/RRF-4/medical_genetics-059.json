The maternal and paternal chromosomes of a pair are called homologous chromosomes (homologs). The only nonhomologous chromosome pairs are the sex chromosomes in males, where a Y chromosome is inherited from the father and an X chromosome from the mother. Thus, each human cell contains a total of 46 chromosomes\u201422 pairs common to both males and females, plus two so-called sex chromosomes (X and Y in males, two Xs in females).

In humans, each meiosis requires that the starting cell keep track of 92 chromatids (46 chromosomes, each of which has duplicated), distributing one complete set of each type of autosome to each of the four haploid progeny. Not surprisingly, mistakes can occur in allocating the chromosomes during this elaborate process. Mistakes are especially common in human female meiosis, which arrests for years after diplotene: meiosis I is completed only at ovulation, and meiosis II only after the egg is fertilized. Indeed, such chromosome segregation errors during egg development are the most common cause of both spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) and mental retardation in humans."

Thus, the chicken genome, at one billion nucleotide pairs, is only about one-third the size 200,000 bases Figure 4\u201367 Synteny between human and mouse chromosomes. In this diagram, the human chromosome set is shown above, with each part of each chromosome colored according to the mouse chromosome with which it is syntenic. The color coding used for each mouse chromosome is shown below. Heterochromatic highly repetitive regions (such as centromeres) that are difficult to sequence cannot be mapped in this way; these are colored black. (Adapted from E.E. Eichler and D. Sankoff, Science 301:793\u2013797, 2003. with permission from AAAS.) Figure 4\u201368 Comparison of a syntenic portion of mouse and human genomes."
