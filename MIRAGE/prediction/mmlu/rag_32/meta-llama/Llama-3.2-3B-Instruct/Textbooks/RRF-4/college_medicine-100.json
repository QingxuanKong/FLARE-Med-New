The SR is described as a network of tubular sacs in the muscle cell cytoplasm that surrounds each myofibril. It is mentioned that the SR serves as an intracellular store of Ca2+ and plays a critical role in muscle contraction and relaxation. The SR is also mentioned to contain Ca2+-release channels that release Ca2+ into the cytosol, and a Ca2+ pump that transports Ca2+ back into the SR. This information indicates that the SR is primarily involved in the storage and regulation of calcium ions in muscle cells.

A Ca2+ pump transports Ca2+ from the cytosol into the ER lumen. A high concentration of Ca2+-binding proteins in the ER facilitates Ca2+ storage. In some cell types, and perhaps in most, specific regions of the ER are specialized for Ca2+ storage. Muscle cells have an abundant, modified smooth ER called the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The release and reuptake of Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum trigger myofibril contraction and relaxation, respectively, during each round of muscle contraction (discussed in Chapter 16)."

The SR is a specialized type of endoplasmic reticulum that forms a network of tubular sacs in the muscle cell cytoplasm, and it serves as an intracellular store of Ca2+. When an action potential depolarizes the muscle cell plasma membrane, Ca2+ is released into the cytosol from the SR through Ca2+-release channels, stimulating the muscle to contract (discussed in Chapters 15 and 16). The Ca2+ pump, which accounts for about 90% of the membrane protein of the SR, moves Ca2+ from the cytosol back into the SR. The endoplasmic reticulum of nonmuscle cells contains a similar Ca2+ pump, but in smaller quantities."

Because the signal from the muscle cell plasma membrane is passed within milliseconds (via the T tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum) to every sarcomere in the cell, all of the myofibrils in the cell contract at once. The increase in Ca2+ concentration is transient because the Ca2+ is rapidly pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by an abundant, ATP-dependent Ca2+-pump (also called a Ca2+-ATPase) in its membrane (see Figure 11\u201313).

            "content": "Ca2+ Functions as a Ubiquitous Intracellular Mediator Many extracellular signals, and not just those that work via G proteins, trigger an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. In muscle cells, Ca2+ triggers contraction, and in many secretory cells, including nerve cells, it triggers secretion. Ca2+ has numerous other functions in a variety of cell types. Ca2+ is such an effective signaling mediator because its concentration in the cytosol is normally very low (~10\u20137 M), whereas its concentration in the extracellular fluid (~10\u20133 M) and in the lumen of the ER [and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in muscle] is high. Thus, there is a large gradient tending to drive Ca2+ into the cytosol across both the plasma membrane and the ER or SR membrane. When a signal transiently opens Ca2+ channels in these membranes, Ca2+ rushes into the cytosol, and the resulting 10\u201320-fold increase in the local Ca2+ concentration activates Ca2+-responsive proteins in the cell."
