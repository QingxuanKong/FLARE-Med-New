    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to understand the anatomy of the corticospinal tract and how it relates to the motor neurons and their distribution in the body. The corticospinal tract is responsible for controlling voluntary movements of the body. The motor neurons from the cerebral cortex descend through the internal capsule and cross over at the level of the medulla oblongata, forming the lateral corticospinal tract. This tract then descends through the spinal cord and controls the muscles of the opposite side of the body.\\n\\nIn this case, the patient has suffered a CVA (cerebrovascular accident) in the area of the left internal capsule, which conveys motor neurons to the right leg. This means that the motor neurons to the right leg are damaged.\\n\\nGiven the anatomy of the corticospinal tract, the damage to the motor neurons will result in weakness or paralysis of the right leg. Since the motor neurons are affected, the reflexes of the right leg will be affected as well. The corticospinal tract is responsible for controlling the extensor muscles of the leg, so the weakness will be more pronounced in these muscles.\\n\\nSpastic paralysis is the most likely outcome in this case. It is characterized by stiffness in the legs, an imbalance of muscle tone, and a tendency to circumduct and scuff the feet. The patient may walk on the toes. In extreme instances, the legs may cross due to increased tone in the adductors. Upper motor neuron signs are present on physical examination.\\n\\nFlaccid paralysis (B) is less likely because it is characterized by weakness or paralysis of the muscles with little or no reflexes. Tremor (C) is not directly related to the corticospinal tract and is not a likely outcome in this case. Hyporeflexia (D) is also less likely because the reflexes of the right leg will be affected due to the damage to the motor neurons.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. spastic paralysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

As the descending axons subserving limb and facial movements emerge from the cortical motor strip, they maintain the anatomic organization of the overlying cortex; therefore, a discrete cortical\u2013subcortical lesion will result in a restricted weakness of the hand and arm or the foot and leg. More caudally, the descending motor fibers converge and are collected in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, so that even a small lesion there will cause a \u201cpure motor hemiplegia,\u201d in which the face, arm, hand, leg, and foot are affected to more or less the same degree (see Lacunar syndromes in Chap. 33). The axons subserving facial movement are situated anterior in the posterior limb of the capsule, those for hand and arm in the central portion and those for the foot and leg, posteriorly (as detailed by Brodal)."

Gradually spasticity develops, and the tendon reflexes become brisker. The arm tends to assume a flexed adducted posture and the leg an extended one. Function is rarely if ever restored after the slow evolution of spasticity; however, the use of botulinum toxin may help considerably in relieving the spasticity. Conversely, the early development of spasticity in the arm or the early appearance of a grasp reflex may presage a favorable outcome. In some patients with extensive temporoparietal lesions, the hemiplegia remains flaccid; the arm dangles and the slack leg must be braced to stand. The physiologic explanation of this remains obscure. If the internal capsule is not interrupted completely in a stroke that involves the lenticular nucleus or thalamus, the paralysis may give way to"

An additional sign of subtle weakness of one side is the asymmetric \u201corbiting\u201d of one forearm around the other when the patient is asked to rotate the fists or index fingers around the other. The strength of the legs can be tested with the patient prone and the knees flexed and observing downward drift of the weakened leg. In the supine position at rest, weakness due to an upper motor neuron lesion causes external rotation of the hip. In testing the power of the legs, it should be kept in mind that the hip flexors and quadriceps of most adults are stronger than the arm of the examiner."

There is decreased voluntary drive on spinal motor neurons (fewer motor units are recruitable and their firing rates are slower), resulting in a slowness of movement. There is also an increased degree of cocontraction of antagonistic muscles, reflected in a decreased rate of rapid alternating movements. These abnormalities probably account for the greater sense of effort and the manifest fatigability in effecting voluntary movement of the weakened muscles. Another phenomenon is the activation of paralyzed muscles as parts of certain automatisms (synkinesias). For example, the paralyzed arm may move suddenly during yawning and stretching. Attempts by the patient to move the hemiplegic limbs may also result in a variety of associated movements.

However, these patients cannot respond to a command to raise the left arm. The language areas on the left side cannot influence the motor areas on the right unless the corpus callosum is intact. Somatosensory stimuli applied to the right side of the body can be described by patients with a transected corpus callosum, but these patients cannot describe the same stimuli applied to the left side of the body.

The L2\u2013S4 spinal nerves intersect in the lumbosacral plexus, and divide to form the main nerve branches to the leg, including the femoral and sciatic nerves.The principal motor tract of the spinal cord is the cortico-spinal tract. It is a two-neuron path, including an upper motor neuron and a lower motor neuron. The upper motor neuron cell body is located within the motor strip of the cerebral cortex. The axon travels through the internal capsule to the brain stem, decussates at the brain stem\u2013spinal cord junction, and travels down the contralateral corticospinal tract to the lower motor Key Points1 Neurologic surgery specializes in primarily surgical manage-ment of central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous system disorders.2 Although clinical examination is paramount, neurosurgical diagnosis and treatment are aided largely by a variety of modalities, such as"

The antigravity muscles\u2014the flexors of the arms and the extensors of the legs\u2014are predominantly affected. The arm tends to assume a flexed and pronated position and the leg an extended and adducted one, indicating that certain spinal neurons are reflexly more active than others."

            "content": "The MCA may be occluded in its longitudinal portion, or the stem, that is proximal to its bifurcation (the term M1 is used to denote this portion of the vessel). An occlusion at this site blocks the flow in the small deep penetrating vessels as well as in superficial cortical branches. An occlusion at the distal end of the stem blocks only the orifices of the divisions of the artery in the sylvian sulcus but leaves unaffected the deep penetrating vessels. The idealized picture of total occlusion of the stem is one of contralateral hemiplegia (involving the face, arm, and leg as a result of infarction of the posterior limb of the internal capsule), hemianesthesia, and can include homonymous visual field deficit (because of infarction of the lateral geniculate body), with deviation of the head and eyes toward the side of the lesion. In addition, there is a variable but usually global aphasia with left hemispheric lesions and anosognosia and amorphosynthesis with right-sided lesions (see"

            "content": "Defective perception of passive movement is judged by comparison with a normal limb or, if perception is bilaterally defective, on the basis of what the examiner has learned through experience to be normal. Slight impairment may be disclosed by a slowness of response or, if the digit is displaced very slowly, by an unawareness or uncertainty that movement has occurred; or, after the digit has been displaced in the same direction several times, the patient may misjudge the first movement in the opposite direction; or, after the examiner has moved the digit, the patient may make a number of small voluntary movements of the toe in an apparent attempt to determine its position or the direction of the movement. Inattentiveness will also cause some of these errors. If joint position sense is impaired at a distal site, the next proximal joint may be tested. The lack of position sense in the legs can also be demonstrated by displacing the limb from its original position and having the"
