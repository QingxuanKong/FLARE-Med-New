    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to evaluate each option based on the current scientific understanding of muscle physiology and exercise science. Let's analyze each option: A. Increasing the protein intake above 3 grams per kg body mass per day will stimulate muscle growth and increase strength. - There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that increasing protein intake above 3 grams per kg body mass per day will stimulate muscle growth and increase strength. The International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day for muscle protein synthesis. B. Creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power. - This is true. Creatine supplementation has been consistently shown to increase muscle strength, power, and endurance in both healthy individuals and athletes. C. Amino acid supplements can increase muscle strength and power. - There is limited scientific evidence to support the claim that amino acid supplements can increase muscle strength and power. While amino acids are important for muscle protein synthesis, the evidence for their direct effect on muscle strength and power is not strong. D. Muscle damage is induced by shortening contractions. - This is true. Muscle damage, also known as muscle soreness or delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), is a common consequence of eccentric contractions, which occur when a muscle is lengthened under load. This type of damage can lead to inflammation and muscle repair. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is B. Creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Which statements are true?

Insulin-induced, postprandial, and fasting hypoglycemia result in release of glucagon and epinephrine. The rise in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) that accompanies ethanol metabolism inhibits gluconeogenesis, leading to hypoglycemia in individuals with depleted stores. Alcohol consumption also increases the risk for hypoglycemia in patients using insulin. Chronic alcohol consumption can cause fatty liver disease. Choose the ONE best answer. 3.1. Which of the following statements is true for insulin but not for glucagon? A. It is a peptide hormone secreted by pancreatic cells. B. Its actions are mediated by binding to a receptor found on the cell membrane of liver cells. C. Its effects include alterations in gene expression. D. Its secretion is decreased by the catecholamines."
