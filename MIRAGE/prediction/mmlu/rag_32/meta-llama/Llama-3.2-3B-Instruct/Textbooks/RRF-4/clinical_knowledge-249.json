The prevalence of primary lymphedema is approximately 1.15 per 100,000 persons less than 20 years of age. Females are affected more frequently than males. Primary lymphedema may be caused by agenesis, hypoplasia, hyperplasia, or obstruction of the lymphatic vessels. There are three clinical subtypes: congenital lymph-edema, which appears shortly after birth; lymphedema praecox, which has its onset at the time of puberty; and lymphedema tarda, which usually begins after age 35. Familial forms of congenital lymphedema (Milroy\u2019s disease) and lymphedema praecox (Meige\u2019s disease) may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with variable penetrance; autosomal or sex-linked recessive forms are less common.

The mechanisms of inflammatory edema are largely related to increased vascular permeability and are discussed in Chapter 3; the noninflammatory causes are described in the following discussion. Fluid movement between the vascular and interstitial spaces is governed mainly by two opposing forces\u2014the vascular hydrostatic pressure and the colloid osmotic pressure produced by plasma proteins. Normally, the outflow of fluid produced by hydrostatic pressure at the arteriolar end of the microcirculation is nearly balanced by inflow at the venular end owing to slightly elevated osmotic pressure; hence there is only a small net outflow of fluid into the interstitial space, which is drained by lymphatic vessels. Either increased hydrostatic pressure or diminished colloid osmotic pressure causes increased movement of water into the interstitium ("

Its presence implies that there is an increase in the permeability of small blood vessels, typically during an inflammatory reaction. In contrast, a transudate is a fluid with low protein content, little or no cellular material, and low specific gravity. It is essentially an ultrafiltrate of blood plasma that is produced as a result of osmotic or hydrostatic imbalance across vessels with normal vascular permeability (Chapter 4). Edema denotes an excess of fluid in the interstitial tissue or serous cavities; it can be either an exudate or a transudate.

In the early stages, the edema is soft and pits easily with pressure. Over time, subcutaneous adipose tissue accumulates, the limb enlarges further and loses its normal contour, and the toes appear square. Thickening of the skin is detected by Stemmer\u2019s sign, which is the inability to tent the skin at the base of the toes.

The development of pleural effusions may further compromise respiratory system function and contribute to breathing discomfort. Early signs of pulmonary edema include exertional dyspnea and orthopnea. Chest radiographs show peribronchial thickening, prominent vascular markings in the upper lung zones, and Kerley B lines. As the pulmonary edema worsens, alveoli fill with fluid; the chest radio-graph shows patchy alveolar filling, typically in a perihilar distribution, which then progresses to diffuse alveolar infiltrates.

In contrast, the physical examination in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is dominated by the findings of the precipitating condition; pulmonary findings may be relatively normal in the early stages. The chest radiograph in cardiogenic pulmonary edema typically shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette, vascular redistribution, interstitial thickening, and perihilar alveolar infiltrates; pleural effusions are common.

The Starling forces also may be imbalanced when the colloid oncotic pressure of the plasma is reduced owing to any factor that may induce hypoalbuminemia, as when large quantities of protein are lost in the urine such as in the nephrotic syndrome (see below), or when synthesis is reduced in a severe catabolic state."

Patients with edema due to acute renal failure commonly have arterial hypertension as well as pulmonary congestion on chest roentgenogram, often without considerable cardiac enlargement, but they may not develop orthopnea.

Heat, redness, and swelling result from the dilation and increased permeability of blood vessels during inflammation, leading to increased local blood flow and leakage of fluid and blood proteins into the tissues. Cytokines and complement fragments have important effects on the endothelium that lines blood vessels; the endothelial cells themselves also produce cytokines in response to infection. These alter the adhesive properties of the endothelial cells and cause circulating leukocytes to stick to the endothelial cells and migrate between them into the site of infection, to which they are attracted by chemokines.

Globally, filariasis (an infection caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori) and environmental exposure to minerals in volcanic soil resulting in podoconiosis in barefoot populations are the most common causes of secondary lymphedema.Clinical DiagnosisIn most patients, the diagnosis of lymphedema can be made based on the history and physical examination alone. Patients commonly complain of heaviness and fatigue in the affected extremity. The limb size increases throughout the day and decreases to some extent, usually minimally, over the course of the night when the patient is recumbent. The limb, however, never completely nor-malizes. In the lower extremity, the swelling classically involves the dorsum of the foot, and the toes have a squared-off appear-ance. In advanced cases, hyperkeratosis of the skin develops, and fluid weeps from"

            "content": "It has been recognized that conditions leading to peripheral edema, such as hypoalbuminemia and increased systemic venous pressure, do not have a similar effect on the brain. By contrast, lesions that alter the blood\u2013brain barrier cause rapid swelling of brain tissue. Klatzo specified two categories of edema: vasogenic and cytotoxic. Fishman added a third, which he called interstitial edema. An example of the latter is the edema that occurs with obstructive hydrocephalus, especially when the ependymal lining is disrupted and CSF seeps into the periventricular tissues in the spaces between cells and myelin. Most neuropathologists use the term interstitial to refer to any increase in the extravascular intercellular compartment of the brain; this would include both vasogenic and interstitial edema."
