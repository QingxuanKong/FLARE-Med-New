The systemic circulation conveys blood from the heart to other tissues of the body and from other tissues of the body to the heart. The heart has two sides: the right side pumps blood through the low-pressure pulmonary circulation, and the left side pumps blood through the high-pressure systemic circulation. The right side of the heart receives deoxygenated blood returning from the body via the inferior and superior venae cavae and pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation via the pulmonary arteries. The left side of the heart receives oxygenated blood returning from the lungs via the four pulmonary veins and pumps it into the aorta for systemic distribution. The aorta is the main artery that arises from the left ventricle and branches into smaller arteries that distribute blood to the rest of the body. The correct sequence of the systemic circulation should start with the left ventricle, followed by the aorta, then the arteries, and finally the capillaries, before returning to the veins.

In an organ such as the kidney, which weighs only approximately 1% as much as the whole body, the vascular resistance is much greater than that of the entire systemic circulation. Hence, it is not surprising that the resistance to flow would be greater for a component organ, such as the kidney, than for the entire systemic circulation because the systemic circulation has not only one kidney but also many more alternative pathways for blood to flow."

In contrast, blood volume in the pulmonary vascular bed is about equally divided among the arterial, capillary, and venous vessels. The cross-sectional area of the venae cavae is larger than that of the aorta. Therefore, the velocity of flow is slower in the venae cavae than in the aorta (see Fig. 15.3 Aortaandlargearteries3006.0Smallarteries4008.0Capillaries3006.0Smallveins230046.0Largeveins90018.0Total420084.0"

In patients whose blood cultures are negative, the etiologic agent is often established by culture or microscopic examination of infected material from a local site; specific identification of microbial DNA or RNA in blood or tissue samples is also used. In some case series, a majority of patients with a clinical picture of severe sepsis or septic shock have had negative microbiologic data."

            "content": "Creative use of the CRISPR system, discovered in bacteria as a defense against viruses, has largely solved this problem. As described in Chapter 7, the CRISPR system uses a guide RNA sequence to target (through complementary base-pairing) double-stranded DNA, which it then cleaves (see Figure 7\u201378). The gene coding for the key component of this system, the bacterial Cas9 protein, has been transferred into a variety of organisms, where it greatly simplifies the process of making transgenic organisms (Figure 8\u201355A and B). The basic strategy is as follows: Cas9 protein is expressed in ES cells along with a guide RNA designed by the experimenter to target a particular location on the genome. The Cas9 and guide RNA associate, the complex is brought to the matching sequence on the genome, and the Cas9 protein makes a double-strand break. As we saw in Chapter 5, double-strand breaks are often repaired by homologous recombination; here, the template chosen by the cell to repair the damage is"

What is the role of the hypothalamus in each of these feedback loops? he main function of the autonomic nervous system is to assist the body in maintaining a constant internal environment (homeostasis). When internal stimuli signal that regulation of the body\u2019s environment is required, the central nervous system (CNS) and its autonomic outflow issue commands that lead to compensatory actions. For example, a sudden increase in systemic blood pressure activates the baroreceptors, which in turn modify the activity of the autonomic nervous system so that the blood pressure is lowered toward its previous level (see"

DNA is isolated from a specimen of interest (e.g., tissue, body fluid) containing a mixture of host DNA and nucleic acids from coexisting microbes, either commensal or pathogenic. All DNA (and RNA if a reverse transcription step is added) is then sequenced, yielding a mixture of DNA sequence fragments (\u201creads\u201d) from organisms present. These reads are then aligned to existing reference genomes for the host or any known microbes, leaving reads that do not align (\u201cmap\u201d) to any known sequence. These unmapped reads are then computationally assembled de novo into the largest contiguous stretches of DNA possible (\u201ccontigs\u201d), representing fragments of previously unsequenced genomes. These genome fragments (contigs) are then mapped onto a phylogenetic tree based on their sequence. Some may represent known but as-yet-unsequenced organisms, while others will represent novel species."

The second is that the right coronary artery can give rise to an important accessory anterior descending artery, which often passes across the RV in the exact location where the right ventriculotomy is commonly performed during repair.68Physiology and Diagnosis. The main pathophysiologic con-sequences of truncus arteriosus are (a) the obligatory mixing of systemic and pulmonary venous blood at the level of the ven-tricular septal defect (VSD) and truncal valve, which leads to arterial saturations near 85% and (b) the presence of a nonre-strictive left-to-right shunt, which occurs during both systole and diastole, the volume of which is determined by the relative resistances of the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Addi-tionally, truncal valve stenosis or regurgitation, the presence of important LVOT obstruction, and stenosis of pulmonary artery branches can"
