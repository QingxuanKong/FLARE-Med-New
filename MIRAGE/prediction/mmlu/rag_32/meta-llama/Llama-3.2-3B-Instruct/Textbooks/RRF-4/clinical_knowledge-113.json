    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concentration of Adrenaline (also known as Epinephrine) and the given options. Adrenaline (Epinephrine) is a hormone and a medication that is used to treat various conditions, including asthma, heart problems, and severe allergic reactions. The typical concentration of Adrenaline in the human body is around 1 microgram per milliliter (\u03bcg/mL) or 1 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL). Let's analyze the options: A. 1 mg/mL = 1000 \u03bcg/mL (this is the same as the typical concentration of Adrenaline in the human body) B. 1 mg/L = 1000 \u03bcg/L (this is equivalent to 1 mg/dL or 1000 \u03bcg/dL, which is a common concentration for Adrenaline in medical settings) C. 1 g/mL = 1,000,000 \u03bcg/mL (this is an extremely high concentration of Adrenaline) D. 100 micrograms/mL = 0.1 mg/mL (this is 1/10th the concentration of Adrenaline in the human body) Given the options, Adrenaline 1 in 1000 is equivalent to 1 mg/mL, which is the same strength as Adrenaline 1 in 1000. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concentration of Adrenaline (Epinephrine) and the given options.

PFK-1 = phosphofructokinase1; PFK-2 = phosphofructokinase-2; P = phosphorylated. Correct answer = C. Immediately following a meal, blood glucose levels and hepatic uptake of glucose increase. The glucose is phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate and used in glycolysis. In response to the rise in blood glucose, the insulin/glucagon ratio increases. As a result, the kinase domain of PFK-2 is dephosphorylated and active. Its product, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, allosterically activates PFK-1. (PFK-1 is not covalently regulated.) Active PFK-1 produces fructose 1,6-bisphosphate that is a feedforward activator of pyruvate kinase. Hepatic pyruvate kinase is covalently regulated, and the rise in insulin favors dephosphorylation and activation."

Large lipid droplets are emulsified (have their surface area increased) in the mouth through the act of chewing (mastication). B. The enzyme colipase facilitates the binding of bile salts to mixed micelles, maximizing the activity of pancreatic lipase. C. The peptide hormone secretin causes the gallbladder to contract and release bile. D. Patients with cystic fibrosis have difficulties with digestion because their pancreatic secretions are less able to reach the small intestine, the primary site of lipid digestion. E. Formation of triacylglycerol-rich chylomicrons is independent of protein synthesis in the intestinal mucosa."

            "content": "Genetics Gem: Acetaldehyde, the product of ethanol oxidation by the hepatic, cytosolic, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-requiring enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), is oxidized to acetate by the mitochondrial, NAD+-requiring aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2). The majority of individuals of East Asian (but not European or African) heritage have a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that renders ALDH2 essentially inactive. This results in aldehyde-induced facial flushing and mild to moderate intoxication after consumption of small amounts of ethanol. Review Questions: Choose the ONE best answer. RQ1. Many of the metabolic consequences of chronic excessive alcohol consumption seen in AK are the result of an increase in the ratio of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to its oxidized form (NAD+) in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Which of the following statements concerning the effects of the rise in mitochondrial NADH is correct?"

A. cya\u2212 (no adenylyl cyclase made) B. i\u2212 (no repressor protein made) C. Oc (operator cannot bind repressor protein) D. One resulting in impaired glucose uptake Correct answer = A. In the absence of glucose, adenylyl cyclase makes cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which forms a complex with the catabolite activator protein (CAP). The cAMP\u2013CAP complex binds the CAP site on the DNA, causing RNA polymerase to bind more efficiently to the lac operon promoter, thereby increasing expression of the operon. With cya\u2212 mutations, adenylyl cyclase is not made, and so the operon is unable to be maximally expressed even when glucose is absent and lactose is present. The absence of a repressor protein or decreased ability of the repressor to bind the operator results in constitutive (essentially constant) expression of the lac operon."

Exercise intolerance, with no rise in blood lactate during exercise Correct answer = E. Myophosphorylase (the muscle isozyme of glycogen phosphorylase) deficiency (or, McArdle disease) prevents glycogen degradation in muscle, depriving muscle of glycogen-derived glucose, resulting in decreased glycolysis and its anaerobic product, lactate. Correct answer = D. 4:6 Transferase (branching enzyme) deficiency (or, Andersen disease), a defect in glycogen synthesis, results in glycogen with fewer branches and decreased solubility. Correct answer = B. Acid maltase [acid \u03b1(1\u21924)-glucosidase] deficiency (or, Pompe disease) prevents degradation of any glycogen brought into lysosomes. A variety of tissues are affected, with the most severe pathology resulting from heart damage."

Its synthesis involves a nonfunctional precursor that gets cleaved to yield a functional molecule. Correct answer = D. Secretion of insulin by pancreatic \u03b2 cells is inhibited by the catecholamines, whereas glucagon secretion by the \u03b1 cells is stimulated by them. All of the other statements are true for both insulin and glucagon. 3.2. In which one of the following tissues is glucose transport into the cell insulin dependent? A. Adipose B. Brain C. Liver D. Red blood cells Correct answer = A. The glucose transporter (GLUT-4) in adipose (and muscle) tissue is dependent on insulin. Insulin results in movement of GLUT-4 from intracellular vesicles to the cell membrane. The other tissues in the list contain GLUT that are independent of insulin because they are always located on the cell membrane."

            "content": "Hypoglycemia is characterized by low blood glucose accompanied by adrenergic and neuroglycopenic symptoms that are rapidly resolved by the administration of glucose. Insulin-induced, postprandial, and fasting hypoglycemia result in release of glucagon and epinephrine. The rise in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) that accompanies ethanol metabolism inhibits gluconeogenesis, leading to hypoglycemia in individuals with depleted stores. Alcohol consumption also increases the risk for hypoglycemia in patients using insulin. Chronic alcohol consumption can cause fatty liver disease. Choose the ONE best answer. 3.1. Which of the following statements is true for insulin but not for glucagon? A. It is a peptide hormone secreted by pancreatic cells. B. Its actions are mediated by binding to a receptor found on the cell membrane of liver cells. C. Its effects include alterations in gene expression. D. Its secretion is decreased by the catecholamines."
