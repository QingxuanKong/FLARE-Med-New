    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's first identify the key characteristics of peroxisomal disorders and the options provided. Peroxisomal disorders are caused by defects in the biogenesis or function of peroxisomes, which are organelles involved in various metabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation, bile acid synthesis, and detoxification of certain substances. Zellweger syndrome is a classic example of a peroxisomal disorder, characterized by the inability to import peroxisomal proteins into the organelle due to a faulty peroxisomal targeting signal or its receptor. This leads to a lack of functional peroxisomes and results in severe abnormalities in various organs. Let's examine the options provided: Option A: Acute intermittent porphyria is a disorder of heme biosynthesis, not a peroxisomal disorder. Option B: Maple syrup urine disease is an amino acid disorder, caused by a deficiency in the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex, not a peroxisomal disorder. Option C: Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is a disorder of fatty acid oxidation, but it is not classified as a peroxisomal disorder. Instead, it is a disorder of the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation system. Option D: Zellweger syndrome is a classic example of a peroxisomal disorder, characterized by the inability to import peroxisomal proteins into the organelle due to a faulty peroxisomal targeting signal or its receptor, leading to a lack of functional peroxisomes and severe abnormalities in various organs. Therefore, the correct answer is Option D: Zellweger syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Several severe disorders are associated with nonfunctional peroxisomes. In the most common inherited disease related to nonfunctional peroxisomes, Zellweger syndrome, which leads to early death, peroxisomes lose their ability to function because of a lack of necessary enzymes. The disorder is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the receptor for the peroxisome targeting signal that does not recognize the signal Ser-Lys-Leu at the carboxyterminus of enzymes directed to peroxisomes. Therapies for peroxisomal disorders have been unsatisfactory to date."

The process, called \u03b2 oxidation, shortens the alkyl chains of fatty acids sequentially in blocks of two carbon atoms at a time, thereby converting the fatty acids to acetyl CoA. The peroxisomes then export the acetyl CoA to the cytosol for use in biosynthetic reactions. In mammalian cells, \u03b2 oxidation occurs in both mitochondria and peroxisomes; in yeast and plant cells, however, this essential reaction occurs exclusively in peroxisomes. An essential biosynthetic function of animal peroxisomes is to catalyze the first reactions in the formation of plasmalogens, which are the most abundant class of phospholipids in myelin (Figure 12\u201328). Plasmalogen deficiencies cause profound abnormalities in the myelination of nerve-cell axons, which is one reason why many peroxisomal disorders lead to neurological disease."

One hypothesis is that peroxisomes are a vestige of an ancient organelle that performed all the oxygen metabolism in the primitive ancestors of eukaryotic cells. When the oxygen produced by photosynthetic bacteria first accumulated in the atmosphere, it would have been highly toxic to most cells. Peroxisomes might have lowered the intracellular concentration of oxygen, while also exploiting its chemical reactivity to perform useful oxidation reactions. According to this view, the later development of mitochondria rendered peroxisomes largely obsolete because many of the same biochemical reactions\u2014which had formerly been carried out in peroxisomes without producing energy\u2014were now coupled to ATP formation by means of oxidative phosphorylation. The oxidation reactions performed by peroxisomes in present-day cells could therefore partly be those whose functions were not taken over by mitochondria."

Female heterozygotes may develop a slower, insidiously progressive spastic myelopathy beginning later in adulthood and without adrenal insufficiency. Diagnosis is usually made by demonstration of elevated levels of very-long-chain fatty acids in plasma and in cultured fibroblasts. The responsible gene encodes the adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ADLP), a peroxisomal membrane transporter involved in carrying long-chain fatty acids to peroxisomes for degradation. Corticosteroid replacement is indicated if hypoadrenalism is present, and bone marrow transplantation and nutritional supplements have been attempted for this condition without clear evidence of efficacy."

            "content": "Peroxisomes are also important in plants. Two types of plant peroxisomes have been studied extensively. One is present in leaves, where it participates in photo-respiration (discussed in Chapter 14) (Figure 12\u201329A). The other type of peroxisome is present in germinating seeds, where it converts the fatty acids stored in seed lipids into the sugars needed for the growth of the young plant. Because this conversion of fats to sugars is accomplished by a series of reactions known as the glyoxylate cycle, these peroxisomes are also called glyoxysomes (Figure 12\u201329B). In the glyoxylate cycle, two molecules of acetyl CoA produced by fatty acid breakdown in the peroxisome are used to make succinic acid, which then leaves the peroxisome and is converted into glucose in the cytosol. The glyoxylate cycle does not occur in animal cells, and animals are therefore unable to convert the fatty acids in fats into carbohydrates. a short signal sequence Directs the import of proteins into peroxisomes"

            "content": "As to the biochemical abnormality, Moser and coworkers (1984) demonstrated a fivefold increase of very-long-chain fatty acids, particularly hexacosanoic acid, in the plasma and cultured skin fibroblasts from 35 patients with Zellweger disease. A similar abnormality was found in cultured amniocytes of women at risk of bearing a child with Zellweger disease, thus permitting prenatal diagnosis. The findings of Moser and colleagues (1984) are in keeping with current notions about the basic abnormality in Zellweger syndrome, namely, that it is caused by a lack of liver peroxisomes (oxidase-containing, membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles), in which the very-long-chain fatty acids are normally oxidized (Goldfischer et al)."
