Therefore, lymphocytes do have a nucleus.\\n\\nB. Monocyte: Document [0] (Title: Histology_Ross) mentions that monocytes are the largest white blood cells, ranging from 15 to 22 \\u00b5m in diameter. The document also states that they have a folded nucleus and gray cytoplasm. Thus, monocytes also have a nucleus.\\n\\nC. Erythrocyte: Document [0] (Title: Histology_Ross) describes erythrocytes as anucleate cells devoid of typical organelles. This indicates that erythrocytes do not have a nucleus.\\n\\nD. Basophil: Document [2] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) mentions that the connections between the lobes of the nucleus in neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils are out of the plane of section. However, it does not explicitly state that these cells do not have a nucleus. Nevertheless, based on the information provided in Document [0] (Title: Histology_Ross), we can infer that basophils also have a nucleus.\\n\\nSo, the correct answer is C.

Leukocytes, unlike erythrocytes, must make their way across the walls of small blood vessels and migrate into tissues to perform their tasks.

Macrocytic cells also tend to be more oval than spherical in shape and are sometimes called macroovalocytes. The automated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) can assist in making a classification. However, some patients may have both iron and vitamin B12 deficiency, which will produce an MCV in the normal range but wide variation in red cell size.

Some cells undergo multiple rounds of nuclear division without intervening cytoplasmic division. In the early Drosophila embryo, for example, the first 13 rounds of nuclear division occur without cytoplasmic division, resulting in the formation of a single large cell containing several thousand nuclei, arranged in a monolayer near the surface. A cell in which multiple nuclei share the same cytoplasm is called a syncytium. This arrangement greatly speeds up early development, as the cells do not have to take the time to go through all the steps of cytokinesis for each division. After these rapid nuclear divisions, membranes are created around each nucleus in one round of coordinated cytokinesis called cellularization. The plasma membrane extends inward and, with the help of an actin\u2013 myosin ring, pinches off to enclose each nucleus (Figure 17\u201351)."

            "content": "At the end of this stage, the nucleus has become much smaller and the cytoplasm more eosinophilic. This is the last stage in which mitosis occurs. The next definable stage is the orthochromatophilic erythrob-last, also called normoblast. Its nucleus is smaller than earlier stages and is extremely condensed. The cytoplasm is considerably less blue leaning more to a pink or eosinophilic coloration. It is slightly larger than a mature erythrocyte. At this stage, it is no longer capable of division. In the next stage, the polychromatophilic erythrocyte, also more commonly called a reticulocyte, has lost its nucleus and is ready to pass into the blood sinusoids of the red bone marrow. Some ribosomes that can still synthesize hemoglobin are present in the cell. These ribosomes create a very slight basophilia to the cell. Comparison of this cell to typical mature erythrocytes in the marrow smear reveals a slight difference in coloration."

            "content": "Blood is a fluid connective tissue that circulates through the cardiovascular system. Like the other connective tissues, blood consists of cells and an extracellular component. Total blood volume in the average adult is about 6 L or 7% to 8% of total body weight. The heart\u2019s pumping action propels blood through the cardiovascular system to the body tissues. Blood\u2019s many functions include: \u0081 delivery of nutrients and oxygen directly or indirectly to cells,\u0081 transport of wastes and carbon dioxide away from cells,\u0081 delivery of hormones and other regulatory substances to and from cells and tissues, \u0081 maintenance of homeostasis by acting as a buffer and participating in coagulation and thermoregulation, and \u0081 transport of humoral agents and cells of the immune system that protect the body from pathogenic agents, foreign proteins, and transformed cells (i.e., cancer cells). Blood consists of cells and their derivatives and a protein-rich fluid called plasma."

            "content": "In blood smears, the mature lymphocyte approximates the size of an erythrocyte. When observed in the light microscope in a blood smear, small lymphocytes have an intensely staining, slightly indented, spherical nucleus (Plate 17, page 302). The cytoplasm appears as a very thin, pale blue rim surrounding the nucleus. In general, there are no recognizable cytoplasmic organelles other than an occasional fine azurophilic granule. The TEM reveals that the cytoplasm primarily contains free ribosomes and a few mitochondria. Other organelles are so sparse that they are usually not seen in a thin section. Small, dense lysosomes that correspond to the azurophilic granules seen in the light microscope are occasionally observed; a pair of centrioles and a small Golgi apparatus are located in the cell center, the area of the indentation of the nucleus."

Blood platelets are responsible for blood clotting and consequently have an essential role in incidents of small vessel damage. Blood smears are utilized for microscope examination and identification of relative numbers of white cells in circulating blood. The blood smear is prepared by placing a small drop of blood on a microscope slide and then smearing it across the slide with the edge of another slide. When properly executed, this method provides a uniform, single layer of blood cells that is allowed to air dry and then stained. Wright\u2019s stain, a modified Romanovsky stain, is generally utilized. In examining the specimen under the microscope, it is useful to use a low magnifica-tion to find areas in which the blood cells have a uniform distribution like that seen in the smear on the adjacent page.
