The first step after confirming a cardiac arrest is to call for emergency services and alert the appropriate team, including emergency medical services (EMS) or a code blue response. This ensures that the necessary personnel and equipment are dispatched to provide life-saving interventions. The order of actions after confirmation of cardiac arrest is typically: (1) call for emergency services, (2) start CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), and (3) begin defibrillation if a defibrillator is available. The provided options do not include calling for emergency services, but rather focus on actions taken after the initial confirmation of cardiac arrest. Therefore, the correct answer is not among the options A, B, or C. The correct answer should be the first action taken after cardiac arrest confirmation, which is to call for emergency services. However, since this option is not available, the best answer is not explicitly provided in the options. The closest correct action, which is to call for emergency services, is not listed, but the next best step after cardiac arrest confirmation, which is to start CPR, is option B (give two rescue breaths), but this is not the first action. The first action after cardiac arrest confirmation is to call for emergency services, which is not listed.

As a result, up to two-thirds of all SCDs occur as the first clinical expression of previously undiagnosed disease or in patients with known heart disease, the extent of which suggests low individual risk. The magnitude of sudden cardiac death as a public health problem is highlighted by the estimate that ~50% of all cardiac deaths are sudden and unexpected, accounting for a total SCD burden estimated to range from <200,000 to >450,000 deaths each year in the United States. SCD is a direct consequence of cardiac arrest, which may be reversible if addressed promptly. Because resuscitation techniques and emergency rescue systems are available to respond to victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, which was uniformly fatal in the past, understanding the SCD problem has practical clinical importance."

The goal in resuscitating a pediatric patient following a cardiopulmonary arrest should be to optimize cardiac output and tissue oxygen delivery, which may be accomplished by using artificial ventilation and chest compression and by the judicious administration of pharmacologic agents. In 2010 the American Heart Association revised the recommendations for resuscitation for adults, children, and infants.

If tension pneumothorax (absent breath sounds on the affected side in combination with shock and hypoxemia) is identified, immediate needle decompression is needed. This is accomplished by placing a 16to 18-gauge angiocatheter into the second intercostal space at the midclavicular line, followed by placement of a chest tube. If open pneumothorax is identified, an occlusive dressing must be applied immediately. This must be secured on three sides only to prevent the development of tension pneumothorax."

            "content": "The initial assessment of a patient in shock should take only a few minutes. It is important that aggressive resuscitation is instituted on the basis of the initial assessment, particularly since early resuscitation from septic and cardiogenic shock may improve survival (see below). If the initial bedside assessment yields equivocal or confounding data, more objective assessments such as echocardiography and/or invasive vascular monitoring may be useful. The goal of early resuscitation is to reestablish adequate tissue perfusion and thus to prevent or minimize 5-9 15-19 25-29 35+ end-organ injury. APACHE II Score"

            "content": "If the physician arrives at the scene of an accident and finds an unconscious patient, a rapid examination should be made before the patient is moved. First it must be determined whether the patient is breathing and has a clear airway and obtainable pulse and blood pressure, and whether there is hemorrhage from a scalp laceration or injured viscera. Severe head injuries that arrest respiration are soon followed by cessation of cardiac function. Injuries of this magnitude are often fatal; if resuscitative measures do not restore and sustain cardiopulmonary function within 4 to 5 min, the brain is usually irreparably damaged. Bleeding from the scalp can usually be controlled by a pressure bandage unless an artery is divided; then a suture becomes necessary. Resuscitative measures (artificial respiration and cardiac compression) should be continued until they are taken over by ambulance personnel. Oxygen should then be administered."
