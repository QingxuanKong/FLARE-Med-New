Transcriptional activators are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences near a gene and help to recruit RNA polymerase to initiate transcription.

The question asks about the function of transcriptional activator proteins, so we need to consider their role in the transcription process.\\n\\nLet's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. bind regions near a eukaryotic gene and allow an RNA polymerase to transcribe a gene: This option accurately describes the function of transcriptional activators.

Transcriptional activators do not bind to ribosomes, but rather to DNA sequences near a gene.\\n\\nC. are produced during an infection of bacteria by a phage: This option is incorrect.

For example, a 1000-fold change in the affinity of RNA polymerase for its promoter corresponds to a change in \u2206G of \u224818 kJ/mole, which could be accounted for by just a few weak, noncovalent bonds. Thus, many activator proteins work simply by providing a few favorable interactions that help to attract RNA polymerase to the promoter.

            "content": "We have seen that transcription activators help RNA polymerase initiate transcription and repressors hinder it. However, the two types of proteins are very similar to one another. For example, to occupy their cis-regulatory sequences, both the tryptophan repressor and the CAP activator protein must bind a small molecule; moreover, they both recognize their cis-regulatory sequences using the same structural motif (the helix\u2013turn\u2013helix shown in Panel 7\u20131). Indeed, some proteins (for example, the CAP protein) can act as both a repressor and an activator, depending on the exact placement of their cis-regulatory sequence relative to the promoter: for some genes, the CAP cis-regulatory sequence overlaps the promoter, and CAP binding thereby prevents the assembly of RNA polymerase at the promoter."

            "content": "Figure 8\u201379 How the cooperative binding of transcription regulatory proteins affects the fraction of promoters bound. (A) Cooperativity is incorporated into our mathematical models by including a Hill coefficient (h) in the equations used previously to determine the fraction of bound promoter (see Figures 8\u201372E and 8\u201375A). When h is 1, the equations shown here become identical to the equations used previously, and there is no cooperativity. (B) The left panel depicts a cooperatively bound transcription activator and the right panel depicts a cooperatively 0.5 bound transcription repressor. Recall from Figure 8\u201375B that gene activity is proportional to bound activator (left panel) or unbound repressor (right panel). 1/KR Note that the plots get steeper as the Hill (B) concentration of protein A concentration of protein R coefficient increases."
