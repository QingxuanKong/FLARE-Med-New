The options given are Cheyne-Stokes respiration, anaerobic respiration, hyperventilation, and ataxic breathing. We will evaluate each option to determine which one is not an abnormal breathing pattern seen in head injury and altered conscious level.\\n\\nCheyne-Stokes respiration is a cyclic pattern of breathing that can be seen in head injury and altered conscious level, so option A is not the correct answer.\\n\\nAnaerobic respiration is not typically described as an abnormal breathing pattern in the context of head injury and altered conscious level. In fact, anaerobic respiration is a normal response to hypoxia, where the body switches from oxidative respiration to anaerobic respiration to generate energy. Therefore, option B is a potential answer.\\n\\nHyperventilation is a common abnormal breathing pattern seen in head injury and altered conscious level, particularly in cases of increased intracranial pressure or metabolic disturbances. So, option C is not the correct answer.\\n\\nAtaxic breathing is also an abnormal breathing pattern seen in head injury and altered conscious level, characterized by irregular and disorganized breathing. Thus, option D is not the correct answer.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.

It is usually possible to categorize the patient by assessing the mental and neurologic status when first seen and at intervals after the accident. The Glasgow Coma Scale has been used for almost 50 years as a rapid reference to accomplish this purpose (Table 34-1) but does not substitute for a fuller neurologic examination. The scale registers three aspects of neurologic function: eye opening, verbal response, and motor response to various stimuli. The scale uses a summed score from 3 to 15; a score of 7 or less is considered to reflect severe trauma and a poor clinical state, 8 to 12, moderate injury, and higher scores, mild injury. The scores provided by this scale correspond roughly with the outcome of the head injury as discussed further on, but its main utility is in"

The abnormalities, which may persist for months or years, consist mainly of a decrease in stages 1 and 2 sleep, and less than the expected amounts of REM sleep and dreaming. Some patients in the persistent vegetative state show a cycle of changes in the EEG, progressing from a picture of abortive spindles and K complexes with cyclic alterations in respiration and pupil size to the acquisition of a more normally structured sleep activity. This sequence usually presages the change from a state of coma to one of minimally conscious state (see Chap. 16). Organized sleep activity is absent in virtually all types of coma that are the result of anatomic damage to the brain. An exception, albeit a semantic one, occurs in the unusual condition known as \u201cspindle coma,\u201d in which persistent coma and the electrographic features of sleep coexist.

Webber and Speck have shown that apnea, Biot breathing, and gasping could be produced in the same animal with lesions in the dorsolateral pontine tegmentum by altering the depth of anesthesia. As pointed out by Fisher and by Plum and Posner, when certain supratentorial lesions progress to the point of temporal lobe and cerebellar herniation, one may observe a succession of respiratory patterns (Cheyne-Stokes, then hyperventilation, then Biot breathing), indicating an extension of the functional disorder from upper to lower brainstem; but again, such a sequence is not always observed. Rapidly evolving lesions of the posterior fossa, mainly masses in the cerebellum, more often cause sudden respiratory arrest without any of the aforementioned abnormalities of breathing as intermediaries; presumably apnea results from fulminant medullary compression by the cerebellar tonsils."

Rarely, if these abnormalities are sufficiently intense, death may occur at the moment of impact, presumably from respiratory arrest.

This is the sense in which concussion was used to mean a reversible traumatic paralysis of nervous function and any physiologic explanation of the syndrome would have to incorporate this temporal sequence. However, the effects of concussion on brain function may last for a variable time (seconds, minutes, hours, or longer) and to set arbitrary limits on the duration of loss of symptoms, that is, to consider a brief loss as indicative of concussion and a prolonged loss as indicative of contusion or other traumatic cerebral lesion, is unsound physiologically.

Rapid, deep (Kussmaul) breathing usually implies metabolic acidosis but may also occur with pontomesencephalic lesions.

            "content": "This is the most frequently encountered clinical situation. Roughly, two degrees of disturbed function can be recognized within this category. In one, the patient only stunned momentarily, \u201csaw stars,\u201d or was briefly disoriented. This injury is insignificant when judged in terms of life or death and brain damage, although, as we point out further on there is still the small possibility of a skull fracture or the later development of an epidural or subdural hematoma. Moreover, some patients are liable to a troublesome posttraumatic syndrome consisting of various combinations of headache, giddiness, lack of mental clarity, fatigability, insomnia, and nervousness that can appear soon after or within a few days of the injury. This problem is discussed in a later section. In the instance of consciousness that was temporarily abolished for a few seconds or minutes, recovery may already be complete or the patient may be in one of the stages of partial recovery described earlier when first"

            "content": "However, there are few critical data to support the routine use of ICP monitoring. Certainly in the patient who is only drowsy or shows only minimal mass effect on CT, it is usually not necessary. Guidelines given by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and allied groups have been that monitoring is appropriate if Glasgow Coma Scale is between 3 and 8 and there are abnormalities on CT scan, or if there is no abnormality on the CT but the patient has any two of age over 40, posturing, or has systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. They set a desirable level of ICP of below 20 mm Hg and this has reinforced the role of ICP monitoring in head trauma management."

Printed discharge instructions, which describe moni-toring for confusion, persistent nausea, weakness, or speech difficulty, should be provided to the caretaker. The patient should return to the emergency department for evaluation of such symptoms.Patients with a history of altered consciousness, amne-sia, progressive headache, skull or facial fracture, vomiting, or seizure have a moderate risk for intracranial injury and should undergo a prompt head CT. If the CT is normal, and the neuro-logic examination has returned to baseline (excluding amnesia of the event), then the patient can be discharged to the care of a responsible adult, again with printed criteria for returning to the emergency room. Otherwise the patient must be admitted for a 24-hour observation"

            "content": "Acute Disorders of Consciousness Available @ StudentConsult.com Acute changes in consciousness vary in degree from mild lethargy and confusion to deep coma. In childhood, the most common causes of coma are toxins, infections, head trauma, hypoxia-ischemia (cardiac arrest, near-drowning), and seizure (postictal state, subclinical status epilepticus) (Table 184-1). The most common cause of long-term morbidity in a patient with depressed consciousness is hypoxia; therefore, airway, breathing and circulation are addressed first. Vital signs, including pulse oximetry, must be assessed. A glucose level should also be checked immediately because hypoglycemia is a rapidly treatable cause of altered mental status. Physical examination searches for clues as to the cause of altered consciousness, such as unusual odors, needle tracts, trauma, or signs of dehydration or organ system failure."
