Monosomy is a type of chromosomal abnormality where an individual has one less chromosome than the typical diploid number. In humans, the typical diploid number is 46 chromosomes, so monosomy would refer to having 45 chromosomes. Now, let's examine each option given in the context of monosomy:\\n\\nA. 46,XX - This is a normal female karyotype, so it is not an example of monosomy.\\n\\nB. 47,XXX - This is a type of trisomy, where an individual has an extra X chromosome. It is not an example of monosomy.\\n\\nC. 69,XYY - This karyotype is not a commonly recognized human karyotype, and it appears to be an error or a misunderstanding. However, if we assume it refers to a possible monosomy, it would imply an individual has one less Y chromosome than the typical male karyotype (47,XY), resulting in 46,XY. This would be an example of monosomy for the Y chromosome, but it is not a commonly used or recognized term.\\n\\nD. 45,X - This is an example of monosomy, where an individual has one less X chromosome than the typical female karyotype (46,XX), resulting in 45,X. This is a recognized condition known as Turner syndrome.\\n\\nSo, the correct answer is D. 45,X.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Monosomy involving an autosome is incompatible with life, whereas trisomies of certain autosomes and monosomy involving sex chromosomes are compatible with life. These, as we shall see, are associated with variable degrees of phenotypic abnormality. Mosaicism is a term used to describe the presence of two or more populations of cells with different complements of chromosomes in the same individual. In the context of chromosome numbers, postzygotic mitotic nondisjunction would result in the production of a trisomic and a monosomic daughter cell; the descendants of these cells would then produce a mosaic. As discussed later, mosaicism affecting sex chromosomes is common, whereas autosomal mosaicism is not."

            "content": "Trisomy 21-Down Syndrome. In 1866, ]. L. H. Down described a group of intellectually disabled children with distinctive physical features. Nearly 100 years later, Lejeune (1959) demonstrated that Down syndrome is caused by an autosomal trisomy (Fig. 13-3). Trisomy 21 causes 95 percent of Down syndrome cases, whereas 3 to 4 percent of cases are due to a robertsonian translocation, described later (p. 262). he remaining 1 to 2 percent results from an isochromosome or from mosaicism. he nondisjunction that yields trisomy 21 occurs during meiosis I in approximately 75 percent of cases, and the remaining events are during meiosis II. Down syndrome is the most common nonlethal trisomy."

            "content": "Both abortion and chromosomal anomaly rates decline with advancing gestational age (Ammon Avalos, 2012; Eiben, 1990). Kajii and associates (1980) noted that 75 percent of chromo somally abnormal abortions occurred by 8 weeks' gestation. Of chromosomal abnormalities, 95 percent are caused by maternal gametogenesis errors, and 5 percent by paternal errors Qacobs, 1980). Most common abnormalities are trisomy, found in 50 to 60 percent; monosomy X, in 9 to 13 percent; and triploidy, in 11 to 12 percent (Eiben, 1980; Jenderny, 2014). Trisomies typically result from isolated nondisjunction, rates of which rise with maternal age (Bow\u00a7, 1975). Trisomies of chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21, and 22 are most common. In contrast, balanced structural chromosomal rearrangements may originate from either parent and are found in 2 to 4 percent of couples with recurrent pregnancy loss."

            "content": "Duplication of genomic regions is better tolerated than deletion, as evidenced by the viability of several autosomal trisomies (whole chromosome duplications) but no autosomal monosomies (whole chromosome deletions). There are several duplication syndromes where the duplicated region of the genome is present as a supernumerary chromosome. Utilization of chromosome microarray analysis has made analysis of the origins of duplicated chromosome material straightforward (Fig. 83e-2). Recurrent syndromes associated with supernumerary chromosomes include the inverted duplication 15 (inv dup 15) syndrome, caused by the presence of a marker chromosome derived from chromosome 15, with two copies of proximal 15q resulting in tetrasomy (four copies) of this region. The inv dup 15 syndrome has a distinct phenotype and is associated with hypotonia, developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and autistic behavior. Another syndrome is the cat eye syndrome, named for the \u201ccat-eyelike\u201d"

Metaphase analysis should be ordered in children whose features suggest a known aneuploidy syndrome, such as a trisomy or monosomy. Chromosomes analyzed in prophase are long, thin, and drawn out; analysis gives far more details than are seen in metaphase preparations. Prophase analysis is ordered in individuals with multiple congenital anomalies without an obvious disorder."
