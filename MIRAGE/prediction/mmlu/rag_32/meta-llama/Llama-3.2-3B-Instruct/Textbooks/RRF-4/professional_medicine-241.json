    "question": "A 27-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his sister because of increasing confusion for 10 hours. He is unable to answer questions. His sister states that he recently saw a psychiatrist for the first time because of hearing voices; he was prescribed a medication, but she is not sure what it is. She says that he has a history of excessive drinking, and she thinks that he has also experimented with illicit drugs. He appears acutely ill. His temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.3\u00b0F), pulse is 124/min, and blood pressure is 160/102 mm Hg. Examination shows profuse diaphoresis and muscle rigidity. His neck is supple. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Mental status examination shows psychomotor agitation alternating with lethargy. His leukocyte count is 15,600/mm3 , and serum creatine kinase activity is 943 U/L. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the given question: 1. The patient presents with confusion, fever, tachycardia, hypertension, profuse diaphoresis, and muscle rigidity, which are classic symptoms of a severe neurological disorder. 2. The patient has a history of excessive drinking and experimentation with illicit drugs, which increases the likelihood of substance-induced psychosis or withdrawal symptoms. 3. The patient's symptoms of psychomotor agitation alternating with lethargy are consistent with a toxic or metabolic cause, rather than a primary psychiatric disorder. 4. The elevated leukocyte count and serum creatine kinase activity suggest muscle damage, which is consistent with a neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or a similar condition. 5. NMS is a rare but life-threatening side effect of certain medications, particularly antipsychotics, which can cause hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction. 6. The patient's history of hearing voices and recent psychiatric evaluation make it likely that the patient was prescribed an antipsychotic medication, which could be the cause of his symptoms. Based on these considerations, the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of confusion, fever, tachycardia, hypertension, profuse diaphoresis, and muscle rigidity, in combination with his history of excessive drinking and experimentation with illicit drugs, make NMS a likely diagnosis. The patient's elevated leukocyte count and serum creatine kinase activity also support this diagnosis. The recent psychiatric evaluation and history of hearing voices suggest that the patient was prescribed an antipsychotic medication, which is a common cause of NMS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

On physical examination, the patient was alert, extubated, and thirsty. Weight was 97.5 kg. Urine output for the previous 24 h had been 3.4 L, with an IV intake of 2 L/d of D5W."

He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor.

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

To witness an attack is of great assistance in diagnosis but electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring is often required for certainty. The lack of an aura, initiating cry, hurtful fall, or incontinence; the presence of peculiar movements such as grimacing, squirming, thrashing and flailing of the limbs, side-to-side motions of the head, and striking at or resisting those who offer assistance; the retention of consciousness during a motor seizure that involves both sides of the body; a long duration of the seizure, its abrupt termination by strong sensory stimulation, lack of postictal confusion, and failure to produce a rise in creatine kinase\u2014are all typical of the psychogenic attack.

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

Fever is most often the result of a systemic infection such as pneumonia or bacterial meningitis or viral encephalitis. An excessively high body temperature (42\u00b0C [107.6\u00b0F] or 43\u00b0C [109.4\u00b0F]) associated with dry skin should arouse suspicion of heat stroke or intoxication by a drug with anticholinergic activity. Fever should not be too easily ascribed to a brain lesion that has disturbed the temperature-regulating center, so-called central fever, which is a rare occurrence. Hypothermia is observed in patients with alcohol or barbiturate intoxication, drowning, exposure to cold, peripheral circulatory failure, advanced tuberculous meningitis, and myxedema."
