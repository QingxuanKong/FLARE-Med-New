According to the provided documents, \u03b1-thalassemia is caused by deletions involving one or more of the \u03b1-globin genes. This information can be found in Document [26] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) and Document [28] (Title: Pathology_Robbins). The severity of the disease is proportional to the number of \u03b1-globin genes that are deleted. The most common forms of \u03b1-thalassemia are caused by a deletion of one or more \u03b1-globin genes. Therefore, the correct answer is related to the deletion of one or more genes.

The most common mutations lead to abnormal RNA splicing, whereas others fall in the \u03b2-globin gene promoter or coding regions. The specific nature of the mutation determines whether the outcome is a \u03b2+ or \u03b20 allele. Defective synthesis of \u03b2-globin in \u03b2-thalassemia contributes to anemia through two mechanisms: (1) inadequate HbA formation, resulting in small (microcytic), poorly hemoglobinized (hypochromic) red cells; and (2) by allowing the accumulation of unpaired \u03b1-globin chains, which form toxic precipitates that severely damage the membranes of red cells and erythroid precursors. A high fraction of erythroid precursors are so badly damaged that they die by apoptosis ("

The mutations that cause thalassemia are particularly common in Mediterranean, African, and Asian regions in which malaria is endemic. As with HbS, it is hypothesized that globin mutations associated with thalassemia protect against falciparum malaria. A diverse collection of \u03b1-globin and \u03b2-globin mutations underlies the thalassemias, which are autosomal codominant conditions.

As a group, they are the most common single-gene disorders in humans.

In the thalassemias, the synthesis of either the \u03b1-or the \u03b2-globin chain is defective, and hemoglobin concentration is reduced. A thalassemia can be caused by a variety of mutations, including entire gene deletions, or substitutions or deletions of one of many nucleotides in the DNA.

Ineffective hematopoiesis has another untoward effect; it is associated with an inappropriate increase in the absorption of dietary iron, which without medical intervention inevitably leads to iron overload. The increased iron absorption is caused by inappropriately low hepcidin, which is a negative regulator of iron absorption (see later). Unlike \u03b2-thalassemia, \u03b1-thalassemia is caused mainly by deletions involving one or more of the \u03b1-globin genes. The severity of the disease is proportional to the number of \u03b1-globin genes that are deleted ("

The gene has become far more prevalent in the United States as a result of immigration of Asian persons, especially in California, where HbE is the most common variant detected. HbE is mildly unstable but not enough to affect RBC life span significantly. Heterozygotes resemble individuals with a mild \u03b2-thalassemia trait. Homozygotes have somewhat more marked abnormalities but are asymptomatic. Compound heterozygotes for HbE and a \u03b2 thalassemia gene can have \u03b2 thalassemia intermedia or \u03b2 thalassemia major, depending on the severity of the coinherited thalassemic gene."

For example, loss of a single \u03b1-globin gene produces a silent-carrier state, whereas deletion of all four \u03b1-globin genes is lethal in utero because the red cells have virtually no oxygen-delivering capacity. With loss of three \u03b1-globin genes there is a relative excess of \u03b2-globin or (early in life) \u03b3-globin chains. Excess \u03b2-globin and \u03b3-globin chains form relatively stable \u03b24 and \u03b34 tetramers known as HbH and Hb Bart, respectively, which cause less membrane damage than the free \u03b1-globin chains that are found in \u03b2-thalassemia; as a result, ineffective erythropoiesis is less pronounced in \u03b1-thalassemia. Unfortunately, both HbH and Hb Bart have an abnormally high affinity for oxygen, which renders them ineffective at delivering oxygen to the tissues."

In the so-called thalassemia belt that extends throughout the shores of the Mediterranean as well as through the Arabian Peninsula, Turkey, Iran, India, and southeastern Asia, the inci-dence of thalassemia is between 2.5% and 15%. However, thal-assemias have been found in people of all ethnic origins.44In all forms of thalassemia, the primary defect is absent or reduced production of hemoglobin chains. From this abnormal-ity, two significant consequences arise: (a) reduced functioning of hemoglobin tetramers, yielding hypochromia and microcy-tosis; and (b) unbalanced biosynthesis of individual \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits, which results in insoluble red blood cells that cannot release oxygen normally and may precipitate with cell aging. Both underproduction of hemoglobin and excess production of unpaired hemoglobin subunits contribute"
