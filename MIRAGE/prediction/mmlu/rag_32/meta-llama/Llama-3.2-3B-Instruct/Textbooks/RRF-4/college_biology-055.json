    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to understand the role of the gray crescent in amphibian embryonic development. The gray crescent is a region of the zygote that contains the future dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis, which is established through cortical rotation after fertilization. In amphibians, the D-V axis is crucial for the proper patterning and development of the embryo. If the first cleavage plane is manipulated so that the gray crescent is contained in only one of the two blastomeres, it will likely disrupt the establishment of the D-V axis. As a result, the blastomere without the gray crescent will be missing the signals necessary for its proper development, and it will likely not form a complete embryo. On the other hand, the blastomere with the gray crescent will still have the necessary signals for its proper development and will likely form a complete, but small, embryo. Therefore, the expected fate of the blastomeres is that the blastomere without the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo, and the blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo as well, but the question is asking for a single answer so the best choice is the one with the blastomere without the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

If the specialized character is defined and maintained by cytoplasmic factors, the transplanted nucleus should switch its pattern of gene expression to conform with that of the host cell.

            "content": "The D-V axis of the Xenopus embryo, by contrast, is defined through the act of fertilization. Following entry of the sperm, the outer cortex of the egg cytoplasm rotates relative to the central core of the egg, so that the animal pole of the cortex becomes slightly shifted to one side (Figure 21\u201314). Treatments that block the rotation allow cleavage to occur normally but produce an embryo with a central gut and no dorsal structures or D-V asymmetry. Thus, this cortical rotation is required to define the D-V axis of the future body by creating the D-V axis of the egg."

            "content": "Embryo Development Initial embryo development is typically assessed 15 to 20 hours after insemination or ICSI, when fertilization is characterized by the presence of two pronuclei and the extrusion of the second polar body (9,361,362). Embryos are examined again for cleavage after 24 to 30 hours of culture (9). The first embryo cleavage occurs approximately 21 hours after fertilization, and subsequent divisions occur every 12 to 15 hours up to the eight-cell stage on the 3rd day of embryo development (363). Compaction to form the 16-cell morula occurs on the 4th day of embryo development, and differentiation of the inner cell mass and trophectoderm to form a blastocyst (containing a \ufb02uid-filled area called a blastocele) is completed by the 5th or 6th day (364,365)."

After the gap gene products refine their positions by mutual repression, they provide a second tier of positional signals that act more locally to regulate finer details of patterning. Gap genes act by controlling the expression of yet other genes, including the pair-rule genes. The pair-rule genes, in turn, collaborate with one another and with the gap genes to set up"

            "content": "One type of evidence comes from studies in which the nucleus of a cell from a frog or tadpole is transplanted into a frog egg whose own nucleus has been removed (an enucleated egg). In a classic set of experiments performed in 1968, it was shown that a nucleus taken from a differentiated donor cell can be reprogrammed in this way to support development of a whole new tadpole (see Figure 7\u20132). But this reprogramming occurs only with difficulty, and it becomes less and less efficient as nuclei from older animals are used. Thus, for example, less than 2% of the enucleated eggs injected with a nucleus from a tadpole epithelial cell developed to the swimming tadpole stage, compared with 35% when the donor nuclei were taken instead from an early (gastrula-stage) embryo. With new experimental tools, the cause of this resistance to reprogramming can now be traced. It arises, at least in part, because specific chromatin structures in the original differentiated nucleus tend to persist and be"
