According to the provided documents, whole blood is frozen within hours of donation and can be stored for up to two years at -18\u00b0C. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is frozen within hours of donation and can be stored for up to two years at -18\u00b0C. However, it requires 20 to 30 minutes to thaw prior to use. Liquid plasma is never frozen and can be stored for up to 26 days at 2\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C. Red blood cells can be stored for up to 42 days with sequential changes in storage solutions. Considering these storage conditions, we can determine the time frame within which a prescribed unit of blood product should commence transfusion before it starts to deteriorate. Given the options provided, the closest answer is 4 hours, as it is the maximum storage time for red blood cells and the closest to the storage time for other blood products.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Several plasma products are available. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is frozen within hours of donation and can be stored for up to two years at -18\u00b0C, but requires 20 to 30 minutes to thaw prior to use, limiting immedi-ate availability. Thawed FFP can be relabeled as thawed plasma, which is immediately transfusable and can be stored for up to 5 days at 2\u00b0 to 4\u00b0C. Liquid plasma is never frozen and can be stored for up to 26 days at 2\u00b0 to 4\u00b0C. In vitro studies demonstrate that liquid plasma"

            "content": "Adequate and prompt blood bank support is critical to therapy of AML. Platelet transfusions should be given as needed to maintain a platelet count \u226510,000/\u03bcL. The platelet count should be kept at higher levels in febrile patients and during episodes of active bleeding or DIC. Patients with poor posttransfusion platelet count increments may benefit from administration of platelets from HLA-matched donors. RBC transfusions should be administered to keep the hemoglobin level >80 g/L (8 g/dL) in the absence of active bleed ing, DIC, or congestive heart failure, which require higher hemoglobin levels. Blood products leukodepleted by filtration should be used to avert or delay alloimmunization as well as febrile reactions. Blood products should also be irradiated to prevent transfusion-associated GVHD. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-negative blood products should be used for CMV-seronegative patients who are potential candidates for allogeneic HSCT. Leukodepleted products are also effective for"

However, recent evidence has demonstrated that the age of red cells may play a significant role in the inflammatory response and incidence of multiple organ failure.82 The changes in the red blood cells that occur during storage include reduction of intracellular ADP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), which alters the oxygen dissociation curve of hemoglobin, resulting in a decrease in oxy-gen transport. Stored RBCs progressively become acidotic with elevated levels of lactate, potassium, and ammonia. Addition-ally, the in vitro hemostatic potential of plasma83 and platelet84 products also decrease with storage.The morphologic and biochemical changes that occur over time in red cells may contribute to worsened outcomes. This limits the ability to bank large amounts of blood, particu-larly rarer blood types, for use in times of high demand and blood supply shortage, such as on the"

Multiple tests performed on donated blood to detect the presence of infectious agents using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) or evidence of prior infections by testing for antibodies to pathogens and sterility of platelet products further reduce the risk of transfusion-acquired infections. Viral Infections \u2022 Hepatitis C virus (HCv) Blood donations are tested for antibodies to HCV and HCV RNA. The risk of acquiring HCV through transfusion is now calculated to be approximately 1 in 2,000,000 units. Infection with HCV may be asymptomatic or lead to chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure."

            "content": "Severe acute AIHA can be a medical emergency. The immediate treatment almost invariably includes transfusion of red cells. This may pose a special problem because, if the antibody involved is nonspecific, all of the blood units cross-matched will be incompatible. In these cases, it is often correct, paradoxically, to transfuse incompatible blood, with the rationale being that the transfused red cells will be destroyed no less but no more than the patient\u2019s own red cells, but in the meantime, the patient stays alive. A situation like this requires close liaison and understanding between the clinical unit treating the patient and the blood transfusion/serology lab. Whenever the anemia is not immediately life-threatening, blood transfusion should be withheld (because compatibility problems may increase with each unit of blood transfused), and medical treatment started immediately with prednisone (1 mg/kg per day), which will produce a remission promptly in at least one-half of patients."
