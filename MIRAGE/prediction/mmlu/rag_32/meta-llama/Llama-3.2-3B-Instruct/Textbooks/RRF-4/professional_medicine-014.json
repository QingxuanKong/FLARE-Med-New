    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a history of being hit from behind below the right knee while playing football, which suggests a possible knee injury. The gait analysis reveals a lack of fluid motion, and the standing flexion test results are negative. This suggests that the knee may not be fully functional or stable. The fact that the cruciate and collateral knee ligaments appear intact suggests that the injury may not be to these structures. The presence of foot drop on the right leg is a significant finding, as it indicates a problem with the peroneal nerve or its function. Given the mechanism of injury and the presence of foot drop, the most likely diagnosis is a posteriorly deviated fibular head, which can put pressure on the peroneal nerve and cause foot drop. This condition is also known as fibular head deformity or fibular head impaction. It is a common finding in cases of ankle fractures or other injuries that affect the fibular head. The other options do not directly relate to the patient's symptoms and history.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

The examiner sits gently on the patient\u2019s foot placing both thumbs on the tibial tuberosity and pushing the tibia backward. If the tibial plateau moves, the posterior cruciate ligament is torn. Assessment of other structures of the knee Assessment of the tibial collateral ligament can be performed by placing a valgus stress on the knee. Assessment of lateral and posterolateral knee structures requires more complex clinical testing. The knee will also be assessed for: joint line tenderness, patellofemoral movement and instability, presence of an effusion, muscle injury, and popliteal fossa masses."

It usually occurs during hyperextension of the knee or as a result of a direct blow to a bent knee such as when striking the knee against the dashboard in a motor vehicle accident. Typically, the injury presents as posterior displacement of the tibia on physical examination (the so called tibial sag sign). Patients complain of knee pain and swelling, inability to bear weight, and instability. The diagnosis is confirmed on MRI. The management, as in ACL injury, depends on the degree of the injury (sprain, partial thickness, full thickness) and the level of desired activity. In the clinic Degenerative joint disease occurs throughout many joints within the body. Articular degeneration may result from an abnormal force across the joint with a normal cartilage or a normal force with abnormal cartilage."

Contact sports may also result in ACL injury due to sudden twisting, hyperextension, and valgus force related to direct collision. The injury usually affects the mid-portion of the ligament and manifests itself as a complete or partial discontinuity of the fibers or abnormal orientation and contour of the ligament. With an acute ACL tear, a sudden click or pop can be heard and the knee becomes rapidly swollen. Several tests are used to clinically assess the injury, and the diagnosis is usually confirmed by MRI. A full thickness ACL tear causes instability of the knee joint. The treatment depends on the desired level of activity of the patient.

In pediatric patients with knee pain, the ipsi-lateral hip should be assessed as well.Examination of the patient will show obligatory external rotation with flexion and loss of internal rotation of the hip. Obtain AP and frog leg lateral views of both the hips.Slipped epiphysis is classified as either stable or unstable on the basis of the patient\u2019s ability to bear weight. It is classi-fied as stable if the patient is able to bear weight and the risk of osteonecrosis is less than 10%. It is classified as unstable if the patient is unable to bear weight even with crutches, and the incidence of avascular necrosis is high.Treatment for slipped capital femoral epiphysis patients is percutaneous screw fixation through the femoral neck to engage the epiphysis, causing the growth plate to close. Reduc-tion of the slipped epiphysis is not recommended because of an increased risk of avascular necrosis. One screw is usually adequate"

            "content": "Although this injury is most common in baseball players who throw frequently (pitcher, catcher, third base, and shortstop), it also occurs in football quarterbacks and tennis players. Patients will usually complain of pain over the medial elbow with throwing that may last for a few days afterward. There may be associated swelling and lateral or posterior elbow pain. Radiation of pain may be secondary to ulnar neuropathy. There is often a flexion contracture of the elbow when compared to the opposite side. Palpation of the medial epicondyle, radial head, capitellum, lateral epicondyle, and olecranon process often reveals tenderness. Ulnar (medial) collateral ligament stability should be assessed. Radiographs should include the contralateral elbow for comparison. Radiographic findings in Little Leaguer\u2019s elbow can vary and may include normal anatomy, medial humeral epicondyle apophyseal avulsion fracture, osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum, radial head abnormalities, and"

Intra-articular fractures require the patient to be non\u2013weight-bearing until the frac-ture shows signs of healing. Complications of these fractures include nonunion, malunion, and stiffness of the knee. Be aware of Hoffa fractures, a coronal fractures that usually involve the lateral femoral condyle. They can be missed on X-rays, but they are easily diagnosed by CT scan. It may need a different fixa-tion than that required for the associated supracondylar fracture component.Knee DislocationsDislocation of the knee is a rare but devastating injury that can be limb-threatening. Some dislocations spontaneously reduce and can be underdiagnosed. When the knee dislocates, the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate liga-ment (PCL) are torn, and various degrees of injury occur to the lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament"

            "content": "There was a positive anterior drawer test of the ankle joint. At this stage it is important to review the mechanism of injury. Typically when running on a hard surface the final phase of push-off involves supination of the foot. If the foot is caught in a pothole or divot, this supinating maneuver continues and inverts the ankle joint in plantarflexion. This puts significant strain on the lateral ligament complex and, given the appropriate circumstances, disruption (in order) of the ligament structures occurs from anterior to posterior. First, the anterior talofibular ligament is disrupted, followed by the calcaneofibular ligament, and then the posterior talofibular ligament. As each of these ligaments is disrupted, the severity of the soft tissue injury is significantly enhanced and the chance of permanent ankle instability is increased."
