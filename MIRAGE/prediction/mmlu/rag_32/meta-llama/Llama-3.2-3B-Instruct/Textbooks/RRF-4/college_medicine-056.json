The glutamine is transported in the blood to the liver where it is cleaved by glutaminase to glutamate and ammonia (see p. 256). The glutamate is oxidatively deaminated to ammonia and \u03b1-ketoglutarate by GDH. The ammonia is converted to urea.

Conversely, the amino acid pool is depleted by three routes: 1) synthesis of body protein, 2) consumption of amino acids as precursors of essential nitrogen-containing small molecules, and 3) conversion of amino acids to glucose, glycogen, fatty acids, and ketone bodies or oxidation to CO2 + H2O (see Fig. 19.2). Although the amino acid pool is small (comprising ~90\u2013100 g of amino acids) in comparison with the amount of protein in the body (~12 kg in a"

            "content": "Blood Ammonia Ammonia is produced in the body during normal protein metabolism and by intestinal bacteria, primarily those in the colon. The liver plays a role in the detoxification of ammonia by converting it to urea, which is excreted by the kidneys. Striated muscle also plays a role in detoxification of ammonia, where it is combined with glutamic acid to form glutamine. Patients with advanced liver disease typically have significant muscle wasting, which likely contributes to hyperammonemia in these patients. Some physicians use the blood ammonia for detecting encephalopathy or for monitoring hepatic synthetic function, although its use for either of these indications has problems. There is very poor correlation between either the presence or the severity of acute encephalopathy and elevation of blood ammonia; it can be occasionally useful for identifying occult liver disease in patients with mental status changes. There is also a poor correlation of the blood serum ammonia and"

The liver uses the glycerol for gluconeogenesis. Muscle protein is degraded to supply amino acids for the liver to use in gluconeogenesis but decreases as ketone bodies increase. The brain can use both glucose and ketone bodies as fuels. From late fasting into starvation, the kidneys play important roles by synthesizing glucose and excreting the protons from ketone body dissociation as ammonium (NH4+)."

            "content": "The urea cycle is a central metabolic pathway in mammals that converts the ammonia (NH4+) produced by the breakdown of nitrogen-containing compounds (such as amino acids) to the urea excreted in urine. Two critical steps of the urea cycle are carried out in the mitochondria of liver cells, while the remaining steps occur in the cytosol. Mitochondria also play an essential part in the metabolic adaptation of cells to different nutritional conditions. For example, under conditions of starvation, proteins in our bodies are broken down to amino acids, and the amino acids are imported into mitochondria and oxidized to produce NADH for ATP production."

            "content": "Resting muscle derives approximately 70 percent of its energy from the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. As stated earlier, the circumstances during exercise are somewhat different. During a short period of intense exercise, the muscle uses carbohydrate derived from glycogen stores; myophosphorylase is the enzyme that initiates the metabolism of glycogen. With longer aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen stores, energy is provided by oxidation of fatty acids. Thus, muscle failure at a certain phase of exercise is predictive of the type of energy failure. A rising blood concentration of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate reflects the increasing oxidation of fatty acids, and an increase in blood lactate reflects the anaerobic metabolism of glucose. The cytochrome oxidative mechanisms are essential in both aerobic and anaerobic muscle"

            "content": "For further discussion of energy balance in health and disease, see Chap. 97. Protein Dietary protein consists of both essential and nonessential amino acids that are required for protein synthesis. The nine essential amino acids are histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine/ cystine, phenylalanine/tyrosine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Certain amino acids, such as alanine, can also be used for energy and gluconeogenesis. When energy intake is inadequate, protein intake must be increased, because ingested amino acids are diverted into pathways of glucose synthesis and oxidation. In extreme energy deprivation, protein-calorie malnutrition may ensue (Chap. 97)."
