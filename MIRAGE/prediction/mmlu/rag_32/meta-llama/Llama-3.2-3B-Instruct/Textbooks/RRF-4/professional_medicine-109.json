The patient presents with recurrent, widespread blister formation, particularly in flexural areas such as the axillae and groin, without oral lesions. This pattern of blister distribution and the fact that the blisters do not break easily suggest a subepidermal blistering disease. The key to this question lies in understanding the histopathological features of the blistering diseases. The provided documents mention that bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a polymorphic autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease, and that the blisters in BP are usually distributed over the lower abdomen, groin, and flexor surface of the extremities. Given the clinical presentation and the histopathological characteristics of BP, the most likely cause of the adhesion failure is the basement membrane. The basement membrane is a critical structure that separates the epidermis from the dermis, and diseases that affect this structure can lead to subepidermal blistering. The other options are not supported by the provided documents: * Dermal papillae (B) are involved in diseases such as dermatitis herpetiformis, which is characterized by IgA deposits in the papillary dermis, not subepidermal blistering. * Langerhans cells (C) are involved in the immune response and are not directly related to the pathogenesis of the blistering disease described. * Melanocytes (D) are responsible for melanin production and are not involved in the adhesion failure leading to blister formation in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Initial lesions may consist of urticarial plaques; most patients eventually display tense blisters on either normal-appearing or erythematous skin (Fig. 73-2). The lesions are usually distributed over the lower abdomen, groin, and flexor surface of the extremities; oral mucosal lesions are found in some patients. Pruritus may be nonexistent or severe. As lesions evolve, tense blisters tend to rupture and be replaced by erosions with or without surmounting crust. Nontraumatized blisters heal without scarring. The major histocompatibility complex class II allele HLA-DQ\u03b21*0301 is prevalent in patients with BP. Despite isolated reports, several studies have shown that patients with BP do not have a higher incidence of malignancy than appropriately ageand gender-matched controls."

Deep partial-thickness burns involve damage to the reticular dermis with damage to skin appendages, as well as the dermal plexus blood vessels and nerves. These have decreased sensation and no cap refill and appear pale or white. Blistering may be present. Damage to the skin append-ages and blood supply in the dermal plexus precludes spontane-ous healing without scar. Excision with skin grafting is needed. Third-degree burns involve full-thickness damage through the dermis and are insensate with no blistering. They appear dry, leathery, and even charred.Acute ManagementAdvanced trauma life support guidelines should be followed. After primary survey, circulation to the hand should be assessed. Palpation and Doppler ultrasound should be used to evaluate blood flow within the radial and ulnar arteries, the pal-mar arches, and digital blood flow at the radial and ulnar aspect of each volar"

            "content": "Although these general features are characteristic of most acute inflammatory reactions, special morphologic patterns are often superimposed on them, depending on the severity of the reaction, its specific cause, and the particular tissue and site involved. The importance of recognizing distinct gross and microscopic patterns of inflammation is that they often provide valuable clues about the underlying cause. Serous inflammation is marked by the exudation of cell-poor fluid into spaces created by injury to surface epithelia Fig. 3.12 Serous inflammation.

            "content": "Biopsy of early lesional skin reveals neutrophil-rich infiltrates within dermal papillae. Neutrophils, fibrin, edema, and microvesicle formation at these sites are characteristic of early disease. Older lesions may demonstrate nonspecific features of a subepidermal bulla or an excoriated papule. Because the clinical and histologic features of this disease can be variable and resemble those of other subepidermal blistering disorders, the diagnosis is confirmed by direct immunofluorescence microscopy of normal-appearing perilesional skin. Such studies demonstrate granular deposits of IgA (with or without complement components) in the papillary dermis and along the epidermal basement membrane zone. IgA deposits in the skin are unaffected by control of disease with medication; however, these immunoreactants diminish in intensity or disappear in patients maintained for long periods on a strict gluten-free diet (see below). Patients with DH have granular deposits of IgA in their epidermal"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"
