A rectal examination is a medical procedure used to evaluate the rectum and anus for various conditions such as hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and rectal prolapse. The examination is typically performed by a healthcare provider and may involve a digital rectal examination (DRE) or anoscopy. The patient is usually asked to strain during the examination to help the provider feel for abnormalities. The position of the patient during the examination can vary depending on the specific procedure and the provider's preference. However, the patient is often asked to lie on their back with their legs elevated or in a lithotomy position to allow for easy access to the rectum. The correct answer can be determined by considering the options provided and the typical procedures associated with a rectal examination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The anal mucosa can be palpated for abnormal masses, and in women, the posterior wall of the vagina and the cervix can be palpated. In men, the prostate can be evaluated for any extraneous nodules or masses. In many instances the digital rectal examination may be followed by proctoscopy or colonoscopy. An ultrasound probe may be placed into the rectum to assess the gynecological structures in females and the prostate in the male before performing a prostatic biopsy.

Mucosal prolapse is known for radial grooves rather than circumferential folds around the anus and is due to increased laxity of the connective tissue between the submucosa and underlying muscle of the anal canal. The evaluation of prolapse should also include cystoproctography and colonoscopy. These examinations evaluate for associated pelvic floor disorders and rule out a malignancy or a polyp as the lead point for prolapse.

Such screening programs are particularly important for individuals with a family history of the disease in first-degree relatives. The relative risk for developing colorectal cancer increases to 1.75 in such individuals and may be even higher if the relative was afflicted before age 60. The prior use of proctosigmoidoscopy as a screening tool was based on the observation that 60% of early lesions are located in the rectosigmoid. For unexplained reasons, however, the proportion of large-bowel cancers arising in the rectum has been decreasing during the past several decades, with a corresponding increase in the proportion of cancers in the more proximal descending colon. As such, the potential for proctosigmoidoscopy to"

While only small increases in the absolute numbers of cervical or anal cancers have been seen as a consequence of HIV infection, the relative risk of these conditions when one compares HIV-infected to -noninfected men and women is on the order of 10to 100-fold. Given the high rates of dysplasia and relative risks for cervical and anal cancer, a comprehensive gynecologic and rectal examination, including Pap smear, is indicated at the initial evaluation and 6 months later for all patients with HIV infection. If these examinations are negative at both time points, the patient should be followed with yearly evaluations. If an initial or repeat Pap smear shows evidence of severe inflammation with reactive squamous changes, the next Pap smear should be performed at 3 months. If, at any time, a Pap smear shows evidence of squamous intraepithelial lesions, colposcopic examination with biopsies as indicated should be performed. The 2-year survival"

Anorectal pain is most often secondary to an anal fissure, perirectal abscess and/or fistula, or a throm-bosed hemorrhoid. Physical examination can usually differenti-ate these conditions. Other, less common causes of anorectal pain include anal canal neoplasms, perianal skin infection, and dermatologic conditions. Proctalgia fugax results from levator spasm and may present without any other anorectal findings. Physical exam is critical in evaluating patients with anorec-tal pain. If a patient is too tender to examine in the office, an examination under anesthesia is necessary. MRI or other imag-ing studies may be helpful in select cases where the etiology of pain is elusive.Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding. The first goal in evaluat-ing and treating a patient with gastrointestinal hemorrhage is adequate"
