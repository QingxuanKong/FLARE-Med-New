    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the compatible blood types that can be given to a person with a blood group B (rhesus negative), we need to consider the ABO blood group system and the Rh blood group system. The ABO blood group system is based on the presence or absence of A and B antigens on the surface of red blood cells. The Rh blood group system is based on the presence or absence of the Rh antigen. A person with blood group B is lacking in the A antigen but has the B antigen. Since the person is also rhesus negative, they lack the Rh antigen. To determine compatible blood types, we need to find blood types that do not have the A or B antigens and do not have the Rh antigen. This means we are looking for blood types that are O and Rh negative. Blood type O is lacking in both A and B antigens, and Rh negative is lacking in the Rh antigen. Therefore, blood type O (rhesus negative) is the only compatible blood type that can be given to a person with blood group B (rhesus negative).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Common gut bacteria bear antigens that are similar or identical to blood-group antigens, and these stimulate the formation of antibodies against these antigens in individuals who do not bear the corresponding antigen on their own red blood cells (left column); thus, type O individuals, who lack A and B, have both anti-A and anti-B antibodies, whereas type AB individuals have neither. The pattern of agglutination of the red blood cells of a transfusion donor or recipient with anti-A and anti-B antibodies reveals the individual\u2019s ABO blood group. Before transfusion, the serum of the recipient is also tested for antibodies that agglutinate the red blood cells of the donor, and vice versa, a procedure called a cross-match, which may detect potentially harmful antibodies against other blood groups that are not part of the ABO system."

These blood-group antigens are arrayed in many copies on the surface of the red blood cell, causing the cells to agglutinate when cross-linked by antibodies. Because hemagglutination involves the cross-linking of blood cells by the simultaneous binding of antibody molecules to identical antigens on different cells, this reaction also demonstrates that each antibody molecule must have at least two identical antigen-binding sites.

Anti-A and anti-B hemolysis is caused by the placental transfer of naturally occurring maternal antibodies from mothers who lack A or B antigen (usually blood type O). Positive results of the direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test on the infant\u2019s RBCs (Fig. 150-4), the indirect antiglobulin test on the mother\u2019s serum, and the presence of spherocytes and immature erythroid precursors (erythroblastosis) on the infant\u2019s blood smear confirm this diagnosis. Isoimmune hemolytic disease varies in clinical severity. There may be no clinical manifestations, or the infant may exhibit jaundice, severe anemia, and hydrops fetalis."

            "content": "Delayed hemolytic reactions are caused by antibodies that recognize red cell antigens that the recipient was sensitized to previously, for example, through a http://ebooksmedicine.net previous blood transfusion. These are typically caused by IgG antibodies and are associated with a positive direct Coombs test and laboratory features of hemolysis (e.g., low haptoglobin and elevated LDH). Antibodies to antigens such as Rh, Kell, and Kidd sometimes fix complement, resulting in severe and potentially fatal reactions identical to those seen with ABO mismatches. Other antibodies that do not fix complement typically result in extravascular hemolysis and relatively minor signs and symptoms."

            "content": "Currently, 33 diferent blood group systems and 339 red cell antigens are recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (Storry, 2014). Although some of these are immunologically and genetically important, many are so rare as to be of little clinical signiicance. Any individual who lacks a specific red cell antigen may produce an antibody when exposed to that antigen. Such antibodies can prove harmful to that individual if she receives an incompatible blood transfusion. Accordingly, blood banks routinely screen for erythrocyte antigens. hese antibodies may also be harmful to a mother's fetus during pregnancy. As noted, maternal antibodies formed against fetal erythrocyte antigens may cross the placenta to cause fetal red cell lysis and anemia."

In the DAT, so-called Coombs serum that recognizes human immunoglobulin (Ig) or complement (C) is used to detect the presence of antibody or C on the surface of the red blood cells (RBCs) by agglutination. A, An IgM antibody can bind two RBCs simultaneously because of its multiple antigen-binding sites. The great size of the IgM allows it to bridge the surface repulsive forces (zeta potential) between RBCs and cause agglutination. B, An IgG antibody is too small to bridge the zeta potential and cause agglutination. C, On the addition of Coombs serum, the zeta potential is bridged successfully, and RBCs agglutinate.
