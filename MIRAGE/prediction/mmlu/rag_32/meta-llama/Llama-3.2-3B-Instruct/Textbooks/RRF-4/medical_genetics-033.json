    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, let's analyze the information given. The F1 offspring are light blue, which means that they do not express the dominant allele for dark blue flowers. This suggests that the dark blue allele is recessive. When the F1 progeny are selfed, a 1:2:1 ratio of dark blue to light blue to white flowers is observed. This ratio indicates that the dark blue allele is incomplete dominant, as it is expressed in 1/3 of the offspring, while the white allele is recessive and not expressed in any of the offspring. This means that the dark blue allele is a partial dominant allele, and it does not completely mask the white allele. Therefore, the genetic phenomenon consistent with these results is incomplete dominance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Many plants need winter before they will flower\u2014a process called vernalization. Cold over a period of weeks or months progressively reduces the level of expression of a remarkable gene called Flowering locus C (Flc). Flc encodes a transcriptional repressor that suppresses expression of the Ft flowering promoter. How does vernalization shut down Flc so as to lift the block to flowering? The effect involves a noncoding RNA called Coolair that overlaps with the Flc gene and is produced when the temperature is low (Figure 21\u201344). Together with cold-induced chromatin modifiers, including Polycomb-group proteins, Coolair coordinates the switching of Flc chromatin to a silent state (discussed in Chapters 4 and 7). The degree of silencing depends on the length of cold exposure enabling the plants to distinguish the odd chilly night from the whole of winter."

            "content": "The ability to produce transgenic plants has greatly accelerated progress in many areas of plant cell biology. It has played an important part, for example, in isolating receptors for growth regulators and in analyzing the mechanisms of morphogenesis and of gene expression in plants. These techniques have also opened up many new possibilities in agriculture that could benefit both the farmer and the consumer. They have made it possible, for example, to modify the ratio of lipid, starch, and protein in seeds, to impart pest and virus resistance to plants, and to create modified plants that tolerate extreme habitats such as salt marshes or water-stressed soil. One variety of rice has been genetically engineered to produce \u03b2-carotene, the precursor of vitamin A. Were it to replace conventional rice, this \u201cgolden rice\u201d\u2014so-called because of its faint yellow color\u2014could help to alleviate severe vitamin A deficiency, which causes blindness in hundreds of thousands of children in the"
