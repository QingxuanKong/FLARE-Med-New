The scientist noticed that at 80% power, 20 mice pressed the lever, at 70% power, 15 mice pressed the lever, and at 60% power, 10 mice pressed the lever. This suggests a relationship between the power level and the number of mice responding. We can use this information to determine the power level corresponding to the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell. The formula to calculate the power level from the number of mice responding is: Power level = 100 - (100 * log10((number of mice responding) / (total number of mice)))\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The ear must detect sound waves traveling in air, but the neural transduction mechanism depends on movement in the fluid-filled cochlea, where acoustic impedance is much higher than that of air. Therefore, without a special device for impedance matching, most sound reaching the ear would simply be reflected, as are voices from shore when a person is swimming under water. Impedance matching in the ear depends on (1) the ratio of the surface area of the large tympanic membrane advantage of the lever system formed by the ossicles. This impedance matching is sufficient to increase the efficiency of energy transfer by nearly 30 dB in the range of hearing from 300 to 3500 Hz."

A decibel (dB) is equal to 20 times the logarithm of the ratio of the sound pressure required to achieve threshold in the patient to the sound pressure required to achieve threshold in a normal-hearing person. Therefore, a change of 6 dB represents doubling of sound pressure, and a change of 20 dB represents a tenfold change in sound pressure. Loudness, which depends on the frequency, intensity, and duration of a sound, doubles with approximately each 10-dB increase in sound pressure level. Pitch, on the other hand, does not directly correlate with frequency. The perception of pitch changes slowly in the low and high frequencies. In the middle tones, which are important for human speech, pitch varies more rapidly with changes in frequency."

The threshold at these frequencies is approximately \u22123 to \u22125 dB, in comparison with the reference 0 dB at 1000 Hz. In reference to this scale, normal speech has an intensity of about 65 dB, and its main frequencies fall in the range of 300 to 3500 Hz. Sounds that exceed 100 dB can damage the peripheral auditory apparatus, and those higher than 120 dB can cause pain and permanent damage. As people age, their thresholds at high frequencies rise, thereby reducing their ability to hear such tones, a condition called presbycusis."

The pure tone stimulus is delivered with an audiometer, an electronic device that allows the presentation of specific frequencies (generally between 250 and 8000 Hz) at specific intensities. Airand bone-conduction thresholds are established for each ear. Air-conduction thresholds are determined by presenting the stimulus in air with the use of headphones. Bone-conduction thresholds are determined by placing the stem of a vibrating tuning fork or an oscillator of an audiometer in contact with the head.

In general, the more severe the hearing impairment, the larger the hearing aid required for auditory rehabilitation. Digital hearing aids lend themselves to individual programming, and multiple and directional microphones at the ear level may be helpful in noisy surroundings. Because all hearing aids amplify noise as well as speech, the only absolute solution to the problem of noise is to place the microphone closer to the speaker than the noise source.

When the vibrating fork is applied to the skull (test for bone conduction), the sound waves are conveyed directly to the cochlea, without intervention of the sound-transmission apparatus of the middle ear, and will therefore not be reduced or lost in outer or middle ear disease.

            "content": "Most auditory neurons at levels above the cochlear nuclei respond to stimulation of either ear (i.e., they have binaural receptive fields). Binaural receptive fields contribute to sound localization. A human can distinguish sounds originating from sources separated by as little as 1 degree. The auditory system uses several clues to judge the origin of sounds, including differences in the time (or phase) of arrival of the sound at the two ears and differences in sound intensity on the two sides of the head."

            "content": "Perforation of the tympanic membrane may cause transient or permanent hearing impairment. The auditory ossicles connect the tympanic membrane to the oval window. The three auditory ossicles, or bones\u2014the malleus, the incus, and the stapes\u2014cross the space of the middle ear in series (Fig. 25.6) and connect the tympanic membrane to the oval window. These bones work like a lever system that increases the force transmitted from the vibrating tympanic membrane to the stapes by decreasing the ratio of their oscillation amplitudes. The ossicles help to convert sound waves to mechanical (hydraulic) vibrations in tissues and fluid-filled chambers. Movable synovial joints connect the bones, which are named according to their approximate shape: \u0081 The malleus (hammer) attaches to the tympanic mem brane and articulates with the incus."

The basilar membrane vibrates at different frequencies throughout its length, according to the frequency of the sound stimulus. In this way, the fibers of the cochlear nerve respond to the full range of audible sound and can differentiate and resolve complexes of sounds."
