The major germ-line mutations conferring susceptibility to breast cancer affect genes that regulate genomic stability or that are involved in progrowth signaling pathways. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are classic tumor suppressor genes, in that cancer arises only when both alleles are inactivated or defective (Chapter 6). BRCA1 and BRCA2 encode proteins that are required for repair of certain kinds of DNA damage. They are normally expressed in many different cells and tissues, and why germline mutations in these genes lead mainly to an increased risk of breast and serous ovarian cancer (discussed earlier) remains mysterious.

In addition to breast cancer, women with BRCA1 mutations have a substantially higher risk for developing epithelial ovarian cancers, and men have a slightly higher risk for developing prostate cancer. Likewise, germ line mutations in the BRCA2 gene increase the risk for developing breast cancer in both men and women, as well as cancers originating from the ovary, prostate, pancreas, bile ducts, stomach, melanocytes, and B lymphocytes. Although the functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 have not been elucidated fully, cells with a defective version of these genes develop chromosomal breaks and severe aneuploidy.

Based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries (SEER) data, 266,120 new cases were esti-mated in 2018 with 40,920 estimated deaths attributed to breast cancers.117 It accounts for 30% of all newly diagnosed cancers in women and is responsible for 14% of"

The Tyrer-Cuzick model attempts to utilize both family history information and individual risk information. It uses the family history to calculate the probability that an individual carries a mutation in one of the breast cancer suscep-tibility genes, and then the risk is adjusted based on personal risk factors, including age at menarche, parity, age at first live birth, age at menopause, history of atypical hyperplasia or LCIS, height, and body mass index.59 Once a risk model has been uti-lized to assess breast cancer risk, this must be communicated to the individual and put into context with"

Women with breast cancer who carry these mutations are at a greatly increased risk of ovarian cancer and a second breast cancer: the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is 54% for women who have a BRCA1 mutation and 23% for those with a BRCA2 mutation, and for the two groups together, there is an 82% lifetime risk of breast cancer (73)."

In the case of hereditary cancers, the individual carries a particular germline mutation in every cell. To date, over 70 genes have been associated with hereditary cancers (Table 10-3).43 A few of these hereditary cancer genes are oncogenes, but most are tumor-suppressor genes. Although hereditary cancer syndromes are rare, somatic mutations that occur in sporadic cancer have been found to disrupt the cellular pathways altered in hereditary cancer syndromes, which sug-gests that these pathways are critical to normal cell growth, cell cycle, and proliferation. Recently, the results of a genome-wide association study of breast cancer in over 120,000 cases and 100,000 controls identified 65 new loci that are associated with overall breast cancer risk.50The following factors may suggest the presence of"

For example, breast cancer develops in 25% to 30% of women who underwent irradiation for Hodgkin lymphoma in their teens and 20s, but the risk for women treated later in life is not elevated. Other Risk Factors. Postmenopausal obesity, postmenopausal hormone replacement, mammographic density, and alcohol consumption also have been implicated as risk factors. The risk associated with obesity probably is due to exposure of the breast to estrogen produced by adipose tissue. In keeping with this, obesity is only associated with an increased risk of tumors that express ER. The three major subtypes of breast cancer defined by differential expression of hormone receptors and HER2 arise through more-or-less distinct pathways that involve the stepwise acquisition of driver mutations in the epithelial cells of the duct/lobular system ("
