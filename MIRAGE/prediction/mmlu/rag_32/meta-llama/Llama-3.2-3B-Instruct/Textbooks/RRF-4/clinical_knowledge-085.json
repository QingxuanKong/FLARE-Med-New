    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down the process of blood pressure measurement and how it affects breathing. Blood pressure measurement typically involves inflating a cuff around the arm to occlude the brachial artery, and then deflating it to listen for Korotkoff sounds. When the cuff is inflated, it compresses the artery and prevents blood flow. When the cuff is deflated, blood starts flowing again, and sounds can be heard through a stethoscope. If the cuff is inflated too much, it can compress the trachea and prevent air from passing through the vocal cords. This can lead to respiratory distress and make it difficult for the patient to talk. The correct answer is therefore related to the compression of the trachea and the inability to pass air through the vocal cords. The other options are not directly related to the inflation of the cuff and its effect on breathing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Extremes in blood pressure are either intrinsically deleterious or are indicative of a serious perturbation in normal physiology. Arterial blood pressure is a complex function of both cardiac output and vascular input impedance.

The duration of balloon inflation and pres-sures used for the angioplasty depend on the indication for the intervention and the location and characteristics of the lesion being treated. Frequently, several inflations are required to achieve a full profile of the balloon. Occasionally, a lower pro-file balloon is needed to predilate the tight stenosis so that the selected balloon catheter can cross the lesion. After inflation, most balloons do not regain their preinflation diameter and assume a larger profile. Trackability, pushability, and cross-ability of the balloon should all be considered when choosing a particular balloon. Lastly, shoulder length is an"

Most cuff-induced fistulas will develop within 2 weeks after placement of the tracheostomy.Clinically, tracheoinnominate artery fistulas present with bleeding. A premonitory hemorrhage often occurs and, although it is usually not massive, must not be ignored or simply attrib-uted to general airway irritation or wound bleeding. With sig-nificant bleeding, the tracheostomy cuff can be hyperinflated to temporarily occlude the arterial injury. If such an effort is unsuccessful, the tracheostomy incision should be immediately opened widely and a finger inserted to compress the artery Brunicardi_Ch19_p0661-p0750.indd 66401/03/19 7:00 PM"

A leader who understands how to motivate a team towards a vision will start with \u201cwhy.\u201d Before ever discussing the checklist in detail with the team, the leader will speak of their shared mission to offer the best patient care possible, ask the team to imagine how they might want a family member treated, and emphasize that a careless error could lead to patient harm and embarrassment for the team. With these argu-ments, which constitute an emotional appeal to the team\u2019s belief system, the leader can expect this vision for better patient care via a new surgical checklist to be adapted by the team. The team will be receptive to implementing a new checklist, not because they believe in the checklist as a tool, but because they believe in the surgeon-leader\u2019s vision for optimizing patient care.There is a biological reason why this concept works. \u201cWhy,\u201d \u201chow,\u201d and \u201cwhat\u201d are correlated to the functions"

            "content": "stents, are deployed if the lesion is in the distal aorta in the proximity of the aortic bifurcation. The role of covered stents such as cuffs made for endoluminal AAA repair has not been rigorously studied. The aortic diameter should be sized with a calibrated catheter during the angiography or by preintervention CT scanning to avoid undersizing. Balloon size will range from 12 to 18 mm in most cases. A single stent is generally sufficient in most cases. Concentric aortic stenosis may encroach upon the IMA, and coverage of this vessel may be unavoidable. Care should be taken to use low inflation pres-sures (5 mmHg) to minimize the risk of aortic rupture. Patient complaints of back or abdominal pain during balloon infla-tion should be taken seriously as they may suggest impending rupture. In case of a calcified small-caliber, hypoplastic aorta (\u226412 mm, typically in female patients), it is recommended to Brunicardi_Ch23_p0897-p0980.indd 94727/02/19 4:14 PM 948SPECIFIC"

After 1 min of vigorous hand exercise (30 hand closures against an ergometer), blood samples are obtained at 1 and 3 min. Normal individuals show a 3to 5-fold increase in blood lactate. In patients with either McArdle or Tarui disease, the lactate fails to rise. This procedure has reportedly caused a localized rhabdomyolysis (Meinck et al), for which reason Griggs and associates recommend that the test be carried out without a blood pressure cuff. Problems with consistency in conducting the test and in processing blood samples for lactate limit its validity unless it is performed by experienced individuals and laboratories. Definitive diagnosis depends more on the histochemical stains of biopsied muscle, which reveal an absence of phosphorylase activity (in McArdle disease) or of phosphofructokinase activity (in Tarui disease). Genetic analysis, can be used to corroborate the"
