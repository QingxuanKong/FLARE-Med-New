The infant was born at term via uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery; he has been breast-feeding well and is urinating and having bowel movements normally. At birth, he weighed 3289 g (7 lb 4 oz; 30th percentile). Today, he weighs 3629 kg (8 lb; 25th percentile). He appears adequately hydrated. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa that do not come off when gently scraped with a tongue blade.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa that do not come off when gently scraped with a tongue blade. This clinical presentation is highly suggestive of oropharyngeal candidiasis, also known as thrush. The patient is a 3-week-old male infant who has been breast-feeding well and is urinating and having bowel movements normally. The patient's birth weight was 3289 g, and the weight has increased to 3629 g, indicating adequate nutrition and hydration. The patient's vital signs are normal, and the physical examination reveals no signs of systemic illness. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is an antifungal medication that is effective against Candida albicans. Fluconazole is a commonly used antifungal medication for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis in infants. It is available in a suspension formulation that can be administered orally, making it a suitable option for infants. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat herpes simplex virus infections, not fungal infections like candidiasis. Nystatin is an antifungal medication, but it is typically used to treat cutaneous or mucosal infections, not oropharyngeal candidiasis. Valacyclovir is also an antiviral medication used to treat herpes simplex virus infections, not fungal infections like candidiasis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

During a 30-year period at Parkland Hospital, during which there were more than 350,000 singleton births, only 1.4 percent of newborns weighed 4500 g or more.

At 40 weeks, such a threshold would correspond to approximately 4500 g.

Oral leukoplakia and erythroplakia are precursor lesions. 1. Leukoplakia is a white plaque that cannot be scraped away; often represents squamous cell dysplasia 2. Leukoplakia is distinct from oral candidiasis (thrush) and hairy leukoplakia. i. Oral candidiasis is a white deposit on the tongue, which is easily scraped away (Fig. 10.4); usually seen in immunocompromised states ii. Hairy leukoplakia is a white, rough ('hairy') patch that arises on the lateral tongue. It is usually seen in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., AIDS) and is due to EBY-induced squamous cell hyperplasia; not pre-malignant 3. Erythroplakia (red plaque) represents vascularized leukoplakia and is highly suggestive of squamous cell dysplasia. 4. Erythroplakia and leukoplakia are often biopsied to rule out carcinoma. pathoma.com"

He has hypertension, and during the last 8 years, he has been adequately managed with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem? What information would you gather to confirm your diagnosis? What treatment steps would you initiate?"

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

            "content": "The diagnosis of colic is made only when the physical examination reveals no organic cause for the infant\u2019s excessive crying. The examination begins with vital signs, weight, length, and head circumference, looking for effects of systemic illness on growth. A thorough inspection of the infant is important to identify possible sources of pain, including skin lesions, corneal abrasions, hair tourniquets, skeletal infections, or signs of child abuse such as fractures (see Chapters 22 and 199). Infants with common conditions such as otitis media, urinary tract infections, mouth ulcerations, and insect bites may present with crying. A neurologic examination may reveal previously undiagnosed neurologic conditions, such as perinatal brain injuries, as the cause of irritability and crying. Observation of the infant during a crying episode is invaluable to assess the infant\u2019s potential for calming and the parents\u2019 skills in soothing the infant."
