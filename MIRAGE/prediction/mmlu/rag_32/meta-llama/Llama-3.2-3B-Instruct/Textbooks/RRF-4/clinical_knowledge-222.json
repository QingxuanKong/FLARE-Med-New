    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the definition and characteristics of haematemesis. Haematemesis refers to the vomiting of blood, which is a symptom of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The options provided relate to various clinical features and associations, but we need to identify the one that is true of haematemesis.\\n\\nOption A mentions low blood pressure (<90mmHg systolic) and tachycardia (>100/min) as worrying features. These are indeed signs of hypovolemic shock, which can be a complication of severe GI bleeding, including haematemesis. Therefore, this option is a characteristic of haematemesis.\\n\\nOption B mentions a pulse rate of 80/min in a patient taking Bisoprolol being reassuring. Bisoprolol is a beta-blocker that can slow heart rate, so a pulse rate of 80/min could be a normal response in a patient taking this medication. This option is not necessarily true of haematemesis.\\n\\nOption C states that abdominal pain is always present in haematemesis. While abdominal pain can be a symptom of GI bleeding, it is not always present in haematemesis. Some patients may not experience pain, especially if the bleeding is rapid or massive. Therefore, this option is not true of haematemesis.\\n\\nOption D claims that an alcohol history is not essential for haematemesis. However, a history of alcohol abuse can be a contributing factor to GI bleeding, including haematemesis. This option is not necessarily true of haematemesis.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is Option A: A low blood pressure (<90mmHg systolic) and a tachycardia (>100/min) are worrying features.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

This initial evaluation, completed well before the bleeding source is confidently identified, guides immediate supportive care of the patient, triage to the ward or intensive care unit, and timing of endoscopy. The severity of the initial hemorrhage is the most important indication for urgent endoscopy, since a large initial bleed increases the likelihood of ongoing or recurrent bleeding.

Severe intravascular hemolysis can be caused by the venom of certain snakes (cobras and vipers), and HA can also follow spider bites.

Of patients with severe malaria, <5% have significant bleeding with evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Hematemesis from stress ulceration or acute gastric erosions also may occur rarely."

The intermediate products of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle are used both as sources of metabolic energy and to produce many of the small molecules used as the raw materials for biosynthesis. Cells store sugar molecules as glycogen in animals and starch in plants; both plants and animals also use fats extensively as a food store. These storage materials in turn serve as a major source of food for humans, along with the proteins that comprise the majority of the dry mass of most of the cells in the foods we eat.

Patients today rarely die from exsanguination, but rather die due to decompensation of other underlying illnesses."

Overt GIB is manifested by hematemesis, vomitus of red blood or \u201ccoffee-grounds\u201d material; melena, black, tarry, foul-smelling stool; and/or hematochezia, passage of bright red or maroon blood from the rectum. Occult GIB may be identified in the absence of overt bleeding when patients present with symptoms of blood loss or anemia such as lightheadedness, syncope, angina, or dyspnea; or when routine diagnostic evaluation reveals iron deficiency anemia or a positive fecal occult blood test. GIB is also categorized by the site of bleeding as UGIB, LGIB, or obscure GIB if the source is unclear."

Its synthesis involves a nonfunctional precursor that gets cleaved to yield a functional molecule. Correct answer = D. Secretion of insulin by pancreatic \u03b2 cells is inhibited by the catecholamines, whereas glucagon secretion by the \u03b1 cells is stimulated by them. All of the other statements are true for both insulin and glucagon. 3.2. In which one of the following tissues is glucose transport into the cell insulin dependent? A. Adipose B. Brain C. Liver D. Red blood cells Correct answer = A. The glucose transporter (GLUT-4) in adipose (and muscle) tissue is dependent on insulin. Insulin results in movement of GLUT-4 from intracellular vesicles to the cell membrane. The other tissues in the list contain GLUT that are independent of insulin because they are always located on the cell membrane."
