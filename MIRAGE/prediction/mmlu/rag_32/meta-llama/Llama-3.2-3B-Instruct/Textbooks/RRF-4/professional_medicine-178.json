    "question": "You are visiting an 86-year-old woman in her home at the request of the patient's daughter because of worsening shortness of breath at rest for the past 2 days. The patient is confined to her home because of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with cor pulmonale. She was discharged 1 week ago from the hospital following 3 weeks of treatment for pneumonia that required intubation; her hospital stay was complicated by sepsis. She had a prolonged weaning program from intubation. Prior to discharge, the patient and her daughter met with you to review the patient's advance directive. During the discussion, the patient said, \"I'd rather die than be intubated again.\" At that time, both the patient and her daughter signed an addendum to that effect on the patient's advance directive. Today, the patient is dyspneic and is unable to complete a sentence. Vital signs are temperature 37.8\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 35/min, and blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 84% while the patient is breathing 4 L of oxygen. You ask the patient if she wishes to return to the hospital. She says, \"No, I want to die at home.\" Her daughter takes you aside and says, \"My mother doesn't know what she's saying. I insist that she be admitted to the hospital.\" After further discussion with the daughter regarding support available at home, which of the following is the most appropriate step?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Admit the patient to the hospital",
        "B": "Arrange for consultation with a home hospice team",
        "C": "Consult with the hospital ethics committee",
        "D": "Order a home continuous positive airway pressure machine and instruct the daughter in its use"

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 86-year-old woman with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with cor pulmonale, who has expressed a clear and specific desire to die at home, as stated in her advance directive and signed addendum. The patient's current condition requires close monitoring and treatment, and the patient is unable to complete a sentence, indicating a significant decline in her functional status. The daughter is concerned about the patient's condition and wants to admit her to the hospital. The key issue is balancing the patient's autonomy and right to die at home with the need to ensure the patient receives necessary medical care and support. The patient's oxygen saturation is 84% on supplemental oxygen, indicating severe hypoxemia, and her respiratory rate is 35/min, suggesting respiratory failure. The most appropriate step is to arrange for consultation with a home hospice team, which can provide the necessary medical care and support to manage the patient's symptoms and ensure her comfort at home, while also respecting the patient's autonomy and wishes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Patients on full ventilatory support should be monitored frequently, with the goal of switching to a mode that allows for weaning as soon as possible. Protocols and guidelines that can be applied by paramedical personnel when physicians are not readily available have proved to be of value in shortening ventilator and intensive care unit (ICU) time, with very good outcomes.

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

Involuntary commitment or isolation for medical treatment may be undertaken for what reason? A 10-year-old child presents in status epilepticus, but her parents refuse treatment on religious grounds. A son asks that his mother not be told about her recently discovered cancer. False. Patients may change their minds at any time.

In severe exacerbations, patients may be so breathless that they are unable to complete sentences and may become cyanotic. Examination usually shows increased ventilation, hyperinflation, and tachycardia. Pulsus paradoxus may be present, but this is rarely a useful clinical sign. There is a marked fall in spirometric values and PEF. Arterial blood gases on air show hypoxemia, and PCO2 is usually low due to hyperventilation. A normal or rising PCO2 is an indication of impending respiratory failure and requires immediate monitoring and therapy. A chest roentgenogram is not usually informative but may show pneumonia or pneumothorax."

This patient was judged to have chronic hyponatremia, i.e., with a suspected duration of >48 h; as such, she would be predisposed to osmotic demyelination were she to undergo too rapid a correction in her plasma Na+ concentration, i.e., by >8\u201310 meq/L in 24 h or 18 meq/L in 48 h. At presentation, she had no symptoms that one would typically attribute to acute hyponatremia, and the plasma Na+ concentration had already increased by a sufficient amount to protect from cerebral edema; however, she had corrected by 1 meq/L per hour within the first 7 h of admission, consistent with impending overcorrection. To reduce or halt the increase in plasma Na+ concentration, the patient received 1 \u03bcg of intravenous DDAVP along with intravenous free water.

Orthopnea is a common indicator of congestive heart failure (CHF), mechanical impairment of the diaphragm associated with obesity, or asthma triggered by esophageal reflux. Nocturnal dyspnea suggests CHF or asthma. Acute, intermittent episodes of dyspnea are more likely to reflect episodes of myocardial ischemia, bronchospasm, or pulmonary embolism, while chronic persistent dyspnea is typical of COPD, interstitial lung disease, and chronic thromboembolic disease. Information on risk factors for occupational lung disease and for coronary artery disease should be elicited. Left atrial myxoma or hepatopulmonary syndrome should be considered when the patient complains of platypnea\u2014i.e., dyspnea in the upright position with relief in the supine position."
