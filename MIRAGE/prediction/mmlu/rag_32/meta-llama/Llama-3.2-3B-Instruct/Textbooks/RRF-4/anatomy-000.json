The facial nerve [VII] is formed from the nuclei within the brainstem emerging at the junction of the pons and the medulla. It enters the internal acoustic meatus, passes to the geniculate ganglion (which gives rise to further branches), and emerges from the skull base after a complex course within the temporal bone, leaving through the stylomastoid foramen. It enters the parotid gland and gives rise to five terminal groups of branches that supply muscles in the face and a number of additional branches that supply deeper or more posterior muscles. A series of lesions may affect the nerve along its course, and it is possible, with good clinical expertise, to determine the exact site of the lesion in relation to the course of the nerve."

In the first type of injury, associated with transverse fractures through the petrous bone, there is an immediate facial palsy, probably caused by contusion or transection of the nerve. Surgical anastomosis has sometimes been successful in restoring function in this circumstance. The second, more common type, is associated with longitudinal fractures of the petrous bone, the facial palsy then often being delayed for several days, a sequence that may be misinterpreted as progression of the intracranial traumatic lesion.

These lesions typically produce cerebellar symptoms ipsilateral to the injured cerebellum and may be associated with an impaired level of consciousness due to brainstem compression and increased intracranial pressure; ipsilateral pontine signs, including sixth and seventh nerve palsies, may be present. Focal and worsening signs of acute ataxia should also prompt consideration of a posterior fossa subdural hematoma, bacterial abscess, or primary or metastatic cerebellar tumor. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies will reveal clinically significant processes of this type. Many of these lesions represent true neurologic emergencies, as sudden herniation, either rostrally through the tentorium or caudal herniation of cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, can occur and is usually devastating. Acute surgical decompression may be"

If visceromotor fibers originally innervating the salivary glands later come to innervate the lacrimal gland, anomalous tearing occurs whenever the patient salivates; this phenomenon is referred to as \u201ccrocodile tears.\u201d A similar mechanism explains gustatory sweating of the cheek and upper lip following injury to parasympathetic innervation of the parotid (Frey syndrome). An unusual congenital synkinesis sometimes occurs between motor trigeminal fibers and branches of the facial nerve, producing a \u201cjaw-winking\u201d phenomenon (also called Wartenberg or inverse Marcus-Gunn sign), in which jaw movements, especially lateral movements (engaging the pterygoid muscle), cause an involuntary closure of the eyelid ipsilateral to the movement."

Various combinations of oculomotor palsies may follow as a result of tumor entry into the orbit via the infraorbital branch of the maxillary nerve. Occasionally there is no pain. We have also observed a similar regional pattern of extracranial involvement of trigeminal and facial nerves with an infiltrative mixed-cell tumor of the parotid gland."

            "content": "Pontine tegmental lesions cause extremely miotic pupils (<1 mm in diameter) with barely perceptible reaction to strong light; this is characteristic of the early phase of pontine hemorrhage. The ipsilateral pupillary dilatation from pinching the side of the neck (the ciliospinal reflex) is usually lost in brainstem lesions. The Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and reduced facial sweating) may be observed ipsilateral to a lesion of the brainstem or hypothalamus or as a sign of dissection of the internal carotid artery."
