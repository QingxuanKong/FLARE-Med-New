Polyploidy is a condition where a cell or organism has more than two sets of chromosomes. In eukaryotes, this can occur naturally during meiosis or mitosis, but it can also be induced artificially. The question asks which agent can induce polyploidy in a dividing eukaryote. Let's evaluate the options: A. Penicillin is an antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis and is not typically used to induce polyploidy in eukaryotes. B. Colchicine is a chemical that inhibits microtubule polymerization, which is essential for mitosis and meiosis. By inhibiting microtubule formation, colchicine can induce polyploidy in eukaryotic cells. C. Tetracycline is an antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis in bacteria and is not typically used to induce polyploidy in eukaryotes. D. Puromycin is an antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis in bacteria and is not typically used to induce polyplody in eukaryotes. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is B.

In contrast, DNA replication in most eukaryotic cells occurs only during a specific part of the cell-division cycle, called the DNA synthesis phase or S phase (Figure 5\u201329). In a mammalian cell, the S phase typically lasts for about 8 hours; in simpler eukaryotic cells such as yeasts, the S phase can be as short as 40 minutes. By its end, each chromosome has been replicated to produce two complete copies, which remain joined together at their centromeres until the M phase (M for mitosis), which soon follows. In Chapter 17, we describe the control system that runs the cell cycle, and we explain why entry into each phase of the cycle requires the cell to have successfully completed the previous phase. In the following sections, we explore how chromosome replication is coordinated within the S phase of the cell cycle."

Chromosome numbers such as 3n and 4n are called polyploid. Polyploidy generally results in a spontaneous abortion. Any number that is not an exact multiple of n is called aneuploid. The chief cause of aneuploidy is nondisjunction of a homologous pair of chromosomes at the first meiotic division or a failure of sister chromatids to separate during the second meiotic division. The latter also may occur during mitosis in somatic cells, leading to the production of two aneuploid cells. Failure of pairing of homologous chromosomes followed by random assortment (anaphase lag) also can lead to aneuploidy. When nondisjunction occurs at the time of meiosis, the gametes formed have either an extra chromosome (n + 1) or one less chromosome (n \u2212 1).

Chromosome duplication occurs during S phase (S for DNA synthesis), which requires 10\u201312 hours and occupies about half of the cell-cycle time in a typical mammalian cell. After S phase, chromosome segregation and cell division occur in M phase (M for mitosis), which requires much less time (less than an hour in a mammalian cell). M phase comprises two major events: nuclear division, or mitosis, during which the copied chromosomes are distributed into a pair of daughter nuclei; and cytoplasmic division, or cytokinesis, when the cell itself divides in two (Figure 17\u20132)."

G1 is the gap between M phase and S phase; G2 is the gap between S phase and M phase. It seems that the order in which replication origins are activated depends, in part, on the chromatin structure in which the origins reside. We saw in Chapter 4 that heterochromatin is a particularly condensed state of chromatin, while euchromatin, where most transcription occurs, has a less condensed conformation. Heterochromatin tends to be replicated very late in S phase, suggesting that the timing of replication is related to the packing of the DNA in chromatin."

Typically, a suspension of cells is treated with certain inactivated viruses or with polyethylene glycol, each of which alters the plasma membranes of cells in a way that induces them to fuse. Eventually, a heterokaryon proceeds to mitosis and produces a hybrid cell in which the two separate nuclear envelopes have been disassembled, allowing all the chromosomes to be brought together in a single large nucleus.

These appeared to result from DNA replication errors that led to the inexact repair of double-strand chromosome breaks. A comparison of the human and chimpanzee genomes reveals that, since the time that these two organisms diverged, such segmental duplications have added about 5 million nucleotide pairs to each genome every million years, with an average duplication size being about 50,000 nucleotide pairs (although there are some duplications five times larger).

            "content": "A cell reproduces by performing an orderly sequence of events in which it duplicates its contents and then divides in two. This cycle of duplication and division, known as the cell cycle, is the essential mechanism by which all living things reproduce. In unicellular species, such as bacteria and yeasts, each cell division produces a complete new organism. In multicellular species, long and complex sequences of cell divisions are required to produce a functioning organism. Even in the adult body, cell division is usually needed to replace cells that die. In fact, each of us must manufacture many millions of cells every second simply to survive: if all cell division were stopped\u2014by exposure to a very large dose of x-rays, for example\u2014we would die within a few days."
