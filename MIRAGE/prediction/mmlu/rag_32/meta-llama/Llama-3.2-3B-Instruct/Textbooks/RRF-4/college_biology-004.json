A strand of RNA can form base pairs with a strand of DNA, generating a DNA\u2013RNA hybrid double helix if the two nucleotide sequences are complementary. Thus, the same templating principle used for DNA synthesis guides the synthesis of RNA primers. Because an RNA primer contains a properly base-paired nucleotide with a 3\u02b9-OH group at one end, it can be elongated by the DNA polymerase at this end to begin an Okazaki fragment. The synthesis of each Okazaki fragment ends when this DNA polymerase runs into the RNA primer attached to the 5\u02b9 end of the previous fragment. To produce a continuous DNA chain from the many DNA fragments made on the lagging strand, a special DNA repair system acts quickly to erase the old RNA primer and replace it with DNA.

A short oligonucleotide complementary to the poly-A tail at the 3\u02b9 end of the mRNA (discussed in Chapter 6) is first hybridized to the RNA to act as a primer for the reverse transcriptase, which then copies the RNA into a complementary DNA chain, thereby forming a DNA\u2013RNA hybrid helix.

In general, the term hybridization describes the ability of single-stranded RNA or DNA molecules to interact (hybridize) with complementary sequences. In the laboratory, hybridization requires the isolation of DNA or RNA, which is then mixed with a complementary nucleotide sequence (called a nucleotide probe). Hybrids are detected most often using a radioactive label attached to one component of the hybrid. Binding of the probe and sequence can take place in a solution or on a nitrocellulose membrane. In in situ hybridization, the binding of the nucleotide probe to the DNA or RNA sequence of interest is performed within cells or tissues, such as cultured cells or whole embryos. This technique allows the localization of specific nucleotide sequences as small as 10 to 20 copies of mRNA or DNA per cell."

Unlike a newly formed DNA strand, the RNA strand does not remain hydrogen-bonded to the DNA template strand. Instead, just behind the region where the ribonucleotides are being added, the RNA chain is displaced and the DNA helix re-forms. Thus, the RNA molecules produced by transcription are released from the DNA template as single strands. In addition, because they are copied from only a limited region of the DNA, RNA molecules are much shorter than DNA molecules. A DNA molecule in a human chromosome can be up to 250 million nucleotide-pairs long; in contrast, most RNAs are no more than a few thousand nucleotides long, and many are considerably shorter."

The primosome makes the RNA primer required for leading-strand synthesis and initiates Okazaki fragment formation in discontinuous lagging-strand synthesis. As with DNA synthesis, the direction of synthesis of the primer is 5\u2032\u21923\u2032. E. Chain elongation Prokaryotic (and eukaryotic) DNA pols elongate a new DNA strand by adding deoxyribonucleotides, one at a time, to the 3\u2032-end of the growing chain (see Fig. 30.16). The sequence of nucleotides that are added is dictated by the base sequence of the template strand with which the incoming nucleotides are paired."

            "content": "Although not nearly as accurate as the DNA polymerases that replicate DNA, RNA polymerases nonetheless have a modest proofreading mechanism. If an incorrect ribonucleotide is added to the growing RNA chain, the polymerase can back up, and the active site of the enzyme can perform an excision reaction that resembles the reverse of the polymerization reaction, except that a water molecule replaces the pyrophosphate and a nucleoside monophosphate is released. Given that DNA and RNA polymerases both carry out template-dependent nucleotide polymerization, it might be expected that the two types of enzymes would be structurally related. However, x-ray crystallographic studies reveal that, other than containing a critical Mg2+ ion at the catalytic site, the two enzymes are quite different. Template-dependent nucleotide-polymerizing enzymes seem to have arisen at least twice during the early evolution of cells. One lineage led to the short region of DNA/RNA helix 5\u02dc5\u02dc direction of"

The copying reaction is catalyzed by the reverse transcriptase enzyme of retroviruses, which synthesizes a complementary DNA chain on an RNA template. The single-stranded cDNA molecules synthesized by the reverse transcriptase are converted by DNA polymerase into double-stranded cDNA molecules, and these molecules are inserted into a plasmid or virus vector and cloned (Figure 8\u201331). Each clone obtained in this way is called a cDNA clone, and the entire collection of clones derived from one mRNA preparation constitutes a cDNA library."

T7 polymerase is then added to produce multiple copies of RNA amplicon from the DNA template. It is qualified at 100 copies/mL. The NASBA technique involves the isothermal amplification of a sequence within the gag region of HIV in the presence of internal standards and employs the production of multiple RNA copies through the action of T7-RNA polymerase. The resulting RNA species are quantitated through hybridization with a molecular beacon DNA probe that is quenched in the absence of hybridization. The lower limit of detection for the NucliSENS assay is 80 copies/mL."

This hypothetical process would require catalysis both of the production of a second RNA strand of complementary nucleotide sequence (not shown) and the use of this second RNA molecule as a template to form many molecules of RNA with the original sequence. The red rays represent the active site of this hypothetical RNA enzyme. Figure 6\u201393 The hypothesis that RNA preceded DNA and proteins in evolution. In the earliest cells, RNA molecules (or their close analogs) would have had combined genetic, structural, and catalytic functions. In present-day cells, DNA is the repository of genetic information, and proteins perform the vast majority of catalytic functions in cells. RNA primarily functions today as a go-between in protein synthesis, although it remains a catalyst for a small number of crucial reactions."
