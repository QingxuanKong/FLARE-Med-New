    "question": "A 57-year-old woman comes to the office for a preoperative evaluation 2 weeks before undergoing scheduled laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and the patient takes no medications. Family history is significant for stable angina in her father and rheumatoid arthritis in her mother. The patient has a 102-year-old grandmother who resides in a nursing care facility and has Parkinson disease. The patient does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages. During the interview, her face is expressionless. She has a flexed posture and is unable to open her mouth wide. She is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 81 kg (179 lb); BMI is 27 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses thickening and hardening of the skin over the dorsum of the hands and forearms, as well as mild kyphosis. Strength testing shows no abnormalities; muscle tension is normal. Passive and active range of motion of the upper extremities is full. Gait is slow and deliberate. The remainder of the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Prior to surgery, further evaluation is indicated for which of the following conditions in this patient?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a flexed posture, inability to open her mouth wide, thickening and hardening of the skin over the dorsum of the hands and forearms, and mild kyphosis. These symptoms, combined with her family history of Parkinson disease and her grandmother's Parkinson disease, suggest a possible diagnosis of a parkinsonian gait disorder. However, the patient's face is expressionless, which is not typical of Parkinson disease. The patient's symptoms also do not suggest systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), as there is no evidence of skin thickening or esophageal dysmotility. Sarcopenia is also unlikely, as the patient's muscle strength and range of motion are normal. Therefore, the most likely condition that requires further evaluation is Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). PSP is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a parkinsonian gait, postural instability, and supranuclear gaze palsy, which can also present with an expressionless face and difficulty opening the mouth wide. The patient's age and family history also support this diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months.

The woman\u2019s most troubling symptoms must be ascertained\u2014how often she leaks urine, how much urine she leaks, what provokes urine loss, what improves or worsens the problem, and what treatment (if any) she had in the past. It is essential to keep the patient\u2019s chief symptom at the forefront to avoid inappropriate management. Consider, for example, a woman whose chief concern is that once a month, while leading a business seminar, she has a sudden, overwhelming urge to void followed by complete bladder emptying. She finds this leakage devastating and is considering quitting her job because of her acute embarrassment. On occasion, she leaks a few drops of urine during exercise, but this minor leakage does not bother her. During the evaluation, urodynamics reveal minimal stress"
