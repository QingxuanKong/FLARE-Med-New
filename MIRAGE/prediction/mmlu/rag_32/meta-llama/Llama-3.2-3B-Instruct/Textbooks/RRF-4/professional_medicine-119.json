    "question": "A 44-year-old woman with a 10-year history of arthritis comes to the office because she has had increasing pain and stiffness in her hands, wrists, and knees during the past several months. She also has had increasing fatigue for the past month, along with a weight loss of 1.8 to 2.2 kg (4 to 5 lb). She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, \"I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months.\" She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her \"drop attacks?\"",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the cause of the patient's 'drop attacks', we need to analyze the symptoms and medical history provided. The patient has a 10-year history of rheumatoid arthritis, which is confirmed by her medical records. She has experienced increasing pain and stiffness in her hands, wrists, and knees, as well as fatigue and weight loss. She also reports having 'drop attacks' characterized by episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes, with one episode resulting in incontinence. These symptoms are accompanied by facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. The patient's symptoms of 'drop attacks' are likely related to her rheumatoid arthritis, specifically the involvement of the peripheral nerves. This condition is known as rheumatoid arthritis-associated neuropathy or rheumatoid neuropathy. This type of neuropathy can cause episodes of weakness, numbness, or tingling in the extremities, including the legs, which can lead to loss of bladder and bowel control, resulting in incontinence. Given this information, the most likely cause of her 'drop attacks' is rheumatoid arthritis-associated neuropathy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

A few patients have pitting edema of the hands or feet, as illustrated in the review by Salvarini and colleagues; others have knee or wrist arthritis or carpal tunnel syndrome. Arthroscopy and MRI suggest that the pain originates in a synovitis or, sometimes more accurately, a bursitis, and in an inflammation of periarticular structures. The fundamental cause is not known."

The muscular soreness may be diffuse or asymmetrical, particularly in the proximal arms and shoulders. Every movement is reported as stiff and painful. The periarticular tissues and their muscular attachments are affected primarily and may be tender, but this is difficult to interpret, because tenderness in these regions may be found in healthy individuals. The sedimentation rate is elevated in the majority of patients, and a 48-h trial of prednisone, by completely alleviating muscle pain, confirms the diagnosis.

Most Japanese patients he described were younger than 20 years, but the 2 cases we have observed in whites were middle-aged. The serum calcium in these patients is normal, and the EMG shows only high-frequency discharges that are characteristic of cramps. A patient of ours with this condition had decades of chronic diarrhea, alopecia, and continuous, extremely painful calf cramps that had the gross appearance of fasciculations. This triad virtually identifies the disease. The cause of the disorder is obscure but is tentatively presumed to be autoimmune. Glucocorticoids, particularly in high doses over short periods, have been tried with some success; dantrolene has also been used and we had the impression that plasma exchange may"

The history should include a review of symptoms, general medical history, review of past surgery, and current medications. The woman\u2019s most troubling symptoms must be ascertained\u2014how often she leaks urine, how much urine she leaks, what provokes urine loss, what improves or worsens the problem, and what treatment (if any) she had in the past. It is essential to keep the patient\u2019s chief symptom at the forefront to avoid inappropriate management. Consider, for example, a woman whose chief concern is that once a month, while leading a business seminar, she has a sudden, overwhelming urge to void followed by complete bladder emptying. She finds this leakage devastating and is considering quitting her job because of her acute embarrassment. On occasion, she leaks a few drops of urine during exercise, but this minor leakage does not bother her. During the evaluation, urodynamics reveal minimal stress"

The arteritis is of small-vessel fibrinoid type and immune globulins are demonstrable in the walls of vessels. Most of the affected patients under our care have had severe rheumatic disease for many years and were strongly seropositive (see Pallis and Scott). In addition to the neuropathy, such patients often have rheumatoid nodules, skin vasculitis, weight loss, and fever. There are rarer forms of chronic progressive polyneuropathy that complicate rheumatoid arthritis; they are described further on."

Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."
