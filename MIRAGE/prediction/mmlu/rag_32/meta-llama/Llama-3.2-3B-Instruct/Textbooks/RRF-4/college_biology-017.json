The key sentence in the provided documents is: \\u201cExperiments on song development in birds have shown that when a young male reared in isolation hears only the song of a different bird species, he will develop an adult song repertoire that lacks certain characteristics typical of his own species.\\u201d This result suggests that the song of a bird species is not entirely determined by genetics, but is also influenced by environmental factors. However, the fact that the young male develops a song repertoire that lacks certain characteristics of his own species when reared in isolation with a different bird species indicates that there is a component of learning involved in song development. This is because the young male is not able to learn the song of his own species when isolated, but is able to learn the song of a different species. Therefore, we can conclude that the song of a bird species is both instinctive and learned. This is supported by the fact that birds are known to have a complex vocal learning system, which involves both innate and acquired components. The innate component provides the foundation for vocal learning, while the acquired component allows birds to learn and mimic specific songs. The fact that the young male is able to develop a song repertoire that lacks certain characteristics of his own species when reared in isolation with a different bird species suggests that the acquired component plays a significant role in song development. Thus, the correct answer is C. both instinctive and learned.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Neuronal turnover occurs on a dramatic scale in certain songbirds\u2019 brains, where large numbers of neurons die each year and are replaced by newborn neurons as part of a process by which the birds refine their song for each new breeding season. In the adult human brain, there is a continuing turnover of neurons in the hippocampus, a region specially concerned with learning and memory. Here, plasticity of adult function is associated with turnover of a specific subset of neurons. About 1400 fresh neurons in this class are generated every day, giving a turnover of 1.75% of the population per year."

As mentioned previously, the earliest phases of vertebrate development are surprisingly variable, even between closely related species, and it is even hard to say precisely how the axes of an early fly embryo correspond to those of an early frog or mouse embryo.

As a general rule, the first recognizable words appear by the end of 12 months. Initially these are attached directly to persons and objects and then are used increasingly to designate objects. The word then becomes the symbol, and this substitution greatly facilitates speaking and later thinking about people and objects. Nouns are learned first, then verbs and other parts of speech. Exposure to and correction by parents and siblings gradually shapes vocal behavior, including the development of a distinctive and enduring accent, to conform to that of the social group in which the child is raised."

If the gland is removed or if thyroid hormone action is blocked, metamorphosis does not occur, although growth continues, producing a giant tadpole. Conversely, a dose of thyroid hormone given to a tadpole by an experimenter can trigger metamorphosis prematurely."

The same receptor also helps direct the elongating axon of each developing olfactory neuron to the specific target neurons that it will connect to in the brain. A different set of GPCRs acts in a similar way in some vertebrates to mediate responses to pheromones, chemical signals detected in a different part of the nose that are used in communication between members of the same species.

They are directly regulated by the activated form of Notch, and they code for inhibitory transcription regulators that inhibit the expression of other genes, including Delta. As well as regulating other genes, the products of Hes genes can directly regulate their own expression, creating a remarkably simple negative feedback loop. Autoregulation of certain specific Hes genes (depending on species) is thought to be the basic generator of the oscillations of the somite clock. Although the machinery has been modified in various ways in different species, the underlying principle seems to be conserved. When the key Hes gene is transcribed, the amount of Hes protein product builds up until it is sufficient to block Hes gene transcription; synthesis of the protein ceases; the protein then decays, permitting transcription to begin"

In a classic set of experiments performed in 1968, it was shown that a nucleus taken from a differentiated donor cell can be reprogrammed in this way to support development of a whole new tadpole (see Figure 7\u20132). But this reprogramming occurs only with difficulty, and it becomes less and less efficient as nuclei from older animals are used. Thus, for example, less than 2% of the enucleated eggs injected with a nucleus from a tadpole epithelial cell developed to the swimming tadpole stage, compared with 35% when the donor nuclei were taken instead from an early (gastrula-stage) embryo. With new experimental tools, the cause of this resistance to reprogramming can now be traced. It arises, at least in part, because specific chromatin structures in the original differentiated nucleus tend to persist and be"

Second, the experiment succeeds in only a limited proportion of cases, and this success rate becomes lower and lower, the more mature the animal from which the transplanted nucleus is taken: very large numbers of transplantations must be done to score a single success if the nucleus comes from a differentiated cell of an adult frog."

Changes in the virus, rendering it less virulent, and the rise of adaptive immunity in the human population, prevented the pandemic from continuing in subsequent seasons, although H1N1 influenza strains continued to cause serious disease every year in very young and very old people.

Similarly, mouse or human embryonic stem cells can be coaxed to generate specific cell types by exposing them in culture to appropriate combinations of signal molecules. In this way, the insights gained through studies of animal development can be used to generate the cell types needed for regenerative medicine, as we discuss in the next chapter. the Insect Dorsoventral axis corresponds to the Vertebrate Ventral-Dorsal axis"

            "content": "Influenza virus strains are classified by their core proteins (ie, A, B, or C), species of origin (eg, avian, swine), and geographic site of isolation. Influenza A, the only strain that causes pandemics, is classified into 16 H (hemagglutinin) and 9 N (neuraminidase) known subtypes based on surface proteins. Although influenza B viruses usually infect only people, influenza A viruses can infect a variety of animal hosts, including birds, providing an extensive reservoir. Current influenza A subtypes that are circulating among worldwide populations include H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. Although avian influenza subtypes are typically highly species-specific, they have on rare occasions crossed the species barrier to infect humans and cats. Viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes (eg, H5N1, H7N9) may rapidly mutate within poultry flocks from a low to high pathogenic form and have recently expanded their host range to cause both avian and human disease. However, person-to-person spread of these avian"

            "content": "Spatial patterning of a developing animal requires that cells become different according to their positions in the embryo, which means that cells must respond to extracellular signals produced by other cells, especially their neighbors. In what is probably the commonest mode of spatial patterning, a group of cells starts out with the same developmental potential, and a signal from cells outside the group then induces one or more members of the group to change their character. This process is called inductive signaling. Generally, the inductive signal is limited in time and space so that only a subset of the cells capable of responding\u2014the cells close to the source of the signal\u2014take on the induced character (Figure 21\u20136). Some inductive signals depend on cell\u2013cell contact; others act over a longer range and are mediated by molecules that diffuse through the extracellular medium or are transported in the bloodstream (see Figure 15\u20132)."
