    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Understanding Noncompetitive Inhibition**: Noncompetitive inhibition occurs when an inhibitor binds to an allosteric site on the enzyme, preventing it from catalyzing a reaction. This type of inhibition does not compete with the substrate for the active site. 2. **Understanding Uncompetitive Inhibition**: Uncompetitive inhibition occurs when an inhibitor binds to the enzyme-substrate complex, preventing catalysis. This type of inhibition can be overcome by increasing the substrate concentration. 3. **Effect of Increasing Substrate Concentration on Noncompetitive Inhibition**: Since noncompetitive inhibition does not compete with the substrate for the active site, increasing the substrate concentration will not affect the binding of the noncompetitive inhibitor to the allosteric site. Therefore, the impact of the noncompetitive inhibitor remains unchanged. 4. **Effect of Increasing Substrate Concentration on Uncompetitive Inhibition**: Uncompetitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme-substrate complex. Increasing the substrate concentration increases the amount of enzyme-substrate complex, making it more difficult for the uncompetitive inhibitor to bind and prevent catalysis. Therefore, increasing the substrate concentration decreases the impact of the uncompetitive inhibitor. Considering these points, the correct answer is: **B. Decreasing impact of uncompetitive inhibitor and increasing impact of noncompetitive inhibitor.**",

Ferrochelatase, an enzyme involved in heme synthesis (see p. 279), is irreversibly inhibited by lead.

            "content": "The relationships shown in Figures 3\u201357 and 3\u201358 apply to all proteins, and they underlie all of cell biology. The principle seems so obvious in retrospect that we now take it for granted. But the discovery of linkage in studies of a few enzymes in the 1950s, followed by an extensive analysis of allosteric mechanisms in proteins in the early 1960s, had a revolutionary effect on our understanding of biology. Since molecule X in these examples binds at a site on the enzyme that is distinct from the site where catalysis occurs, it need not have any chemical relationship to the substrate that binds at the active site. Moreover, as we have just seen, for enzymes that are regulated in this way, molecule X can either turn the enzyme on (positive regulation) or turn it off (negative regulation). By such a mechanism, allosteric proteins serve as general switches that, in principle, can allow one molecule in a cell to affect the fate of any other."

[S] Km Figure 3\u201347 enzymatic acceleration of chemical reactions by decreasing the activation energy. There is a single transition state in this example. However, often both the uncatalyzed reaction (A) and the enzyme-catalyzed reaction (B) go through a series of transition states. In that case, it is the transition state with the highest energy (ST and EST) that determines the activation energy and limits the rate of the reaction. (S = substrate; P = product of the reaction; ES = enzyme\u2013substrate complex; EP = enzyme\u2013 product complex.) Because this tight binding greatly lowers the energy of the transition state, the enzyme greatly accelerates a particular reaction by lowering the activation energy that is required (Figure 3\u201347)."

Different enzymes show different responses to changes in substrate concentration, temperature, and pH. This section describes factors that influence the reaction velocity of enzymes. Enzymic responses to these factors give us valuable clues as to how enzymes function in living cells (that is, in vivo). A. Substrate concentration 1. Maximal velocity: The rate or velocity of a reaction (v) is the number of substrate molecules converted to product per unit time. Velocity is usually expressed as \u00b5mol of product formed per minute. The rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction increases with substrate concentration until a maximal velocity (Vmax) is reached (Fig. 5.6). The leveling off of the reaction rate at high substrate concentrations reflects the saturation with substrate of all available binding sites on the enzyme molecules present. 2."
