The chain of survival has four links: early recognition and call for help, early CPR, early defibrillation, and post-resuscitation care. The correct sequence is: 1. Early recognition and call for help, 2. Early CPR, 3. Early defibrillation, and 4. Post-resuscitation care. This sequence makes sense because if help is not called early, CPR cannot be performed, and defibrillation cannot be administered. Additionally, post-resuscitation care is only necessary if the patient has been resuscitated successfully.

The approach to cardiopulmonary arrest extends beyond CPR and includes efforts to preserve vital organ function. The goal in resuscitating a pediatric patient following a cardiopulmonary arrest should be to optimize cardiac output and tissue oxygen delivery, which may be accomplished by using artificial ventilation and chest compression and by the judicious administration of pharmacologic agents. In 2010 the American Heart Association revised the recommendations for resuscitation for adults, children, and infants.

Confusion in terms can be avoided by adhering strictly to definitions of cardiovascular collapse, cardiac arrest, and death (Table 327-1). Although cardiac arrest is often potentially reversible by appropriate and timely interventions, death is biologically, legally, and literally an absolute and irreversible event. Biological death may be delayed by interventions, but the relevant pathophysiologic event remains the sudden and unexpected cardiac arrest.

The magnitude of sudden cardiac death as a public health problem is highlighted by the estimate that ~50% of all cardiac deaths are sudden and unexpected, accounting for a total SCD burden estimated to range from <200,000 to >450,000 deaths each year in the United States. SCD is a direct consequence of cardiac arrest, which may be reversible if addressed promptly. Because resuscitation techniques and emergency rescue systems are available to respond to victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, which was uniformly fatal in the past, understanding the SCD problem has practical clinical importance."

            "content": "In the setting of acute MI (Chap. 295), it is important to distinguish between primary and secondary cardiac arrests. Primary cardiac arrests are those that occur in the absence of hemodynamic instability, and secondary cardiac arrests are those that occur in patients in whom abnormal hemodynamics dominate the clinical picture before cardiac arrest. The success rate for immediate resuscitation in primary cardiac arrest during acute MI in a monitored setting should exceed 90%. In contrast, as many as 70% of patients with secondary cardiac arrest succumb immediately or during the same hospitalization."
