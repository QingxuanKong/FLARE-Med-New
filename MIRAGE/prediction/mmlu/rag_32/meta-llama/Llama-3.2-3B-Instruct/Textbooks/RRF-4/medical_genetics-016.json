For those mutations that do become fixed, the mathematics shows that the average time to fixation is approximately 4N generations. Detailed analyses of data on human genetic variation have suggested an ancestral population size of approximately 10,000 at the time when the current pattern of genetic variation was largely established. With a population that has reached this size, the probability that a new, selectively neutral mutation would become fixed is small (1/20,000), while the average time to fixation would be on the order of 800,000 years (assuming a 20-year generation time).

            "content": "21\u201314 The segmentation of somites in vertebrate embryos is thought to depend on oscillations in the expression of the Hes7 gene. Mathematical modeling explains these oscillations in terms of the delays in production of the unstable Hes7 protein, which acts as a transcription regulator to shut off its own expression. Once Hes7 decays, with a half-life of about 20 minutes, its transcription resumes. To test this model, you decide to reduce the total delay by removing one, two, or all three of the introns from the Hes7 gene in mice. Why do you expect that intron removal would reduce the delay? What would you predict would happen to the oscillation time, and somite formation, if the model were correct?"

            "content": "Similar arguments explain another phenomenon with important practical implications for genetic counseling. In an isolated community descended from a small group of founders, such as the people of Iceland or the Jews of Eastern individual with rare allele Europe, genetic variants that are rare in the human population as a whole can often be present at a high frequency, even if those variants are mildly deleterious (Figure 4\u201378). A great Deal Can be learned from Analyses of the variation Among Humans Even though the common variant gene alleles among modern humans originate from variants present in a comparatively tiny group of ancestors, the total number of variants now encountered, including those that are individually rare, is very large. New neutral mutations are constantly occurring and accumulating, even though no single one of them has had enough time to become fixed in the vast modern human population."

Rieder.) 17\u201313 Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) are the most common autosomal trisomies seen in human infants. Does this fact mean that these chromosomes are the most difficult to segregate properly during meiosis? 17\u201314 The human genome consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes). During meiosis, the maternal and paternal sets of homologs pair, and then are separated into gametes, so that each contains 23 chromosomes. If you assume that the chromosomes in the paired homologs are randomly assorted to daughter cells, how many potential combinations of paternal and maternal homologs can be generated during meiosis? (For the purposes of this calculation, assume that no recombination occurs.)"
