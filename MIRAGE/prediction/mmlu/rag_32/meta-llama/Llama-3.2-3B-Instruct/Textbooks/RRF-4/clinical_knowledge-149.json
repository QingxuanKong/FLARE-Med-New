The documents describe the heart as a four-chambered organ consisting of a right and left atrium and a right and left ventricle. This information is crucial in understanding the heart's anatomy and function. The heart also has valves that separate the chambers and direct blood flow in a unidirectional manner. The question asks about the number of valves and chambers in the heart. From the documents, we know that the heart has four chambers and that there are valves between the atria and ventricles as well as between the ventricles and the out-flow vessels. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect the presence of four chambers and four valves. The heart has valves that separate the atria and ventricles, and there are also valves between the ventricles and the out-flow vessels, making four valves in total. This makes option B the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Specifically, the cardiac muscle cells are connected together to form an electrical syncytium, with tight electrical and mechanical connections between adjacent cardiac muscle cells. An action potential initiated in a specialized region of the heart (e.g., the sinoatrial node) is therefore able to pass quickly throughout the heart to facilitate synchronized contraction of the cardiac muscle cells, which is important for the pumping action of the heart. Likewise, refilling of the heart requires synchronized relaxation of the heart; abnormal relaxation often results in pathological conditions."

Analysis of the control of cardiac output has thus far been restricted to the control of stroke volume, and the role of heart rate has not been considered. Analysis of the effect of a change in heart rate on cardiac output is complex because a change in heart rate alters the other three factors (preload, afterload, and myocardial contractility) that determine stroke volume (see Fig. 19.1 ). An increase in heart rate, for example, shortens the duration of diastole. Hence, ventricular filling is diminished; that is, preload is reduced. If an increase in heart rate altered cardiac output, arterial pressure would change; that is, afterload would be altered. A rise in heart rate would increase the net influx of Ca++ per minute into myocardial cells (see also ), and this influx would enhance myocardial contractility."

All of these determinants are interdependent, inasmuch as a change in one determinant of cardiac output almost invariably alters another.

The caudal, inflow region of the heart tube, which is destined to adopt a more rostral final position, represents the atrial anlagen, whereas the rostral, outflow portion of the tube forms the truncus arteriosus, which divides to produce the aorta and the proximal pulmonary artery. Between these extremes lie the structural precursors of the ventricles. The linear heart tube undergoes an asymmetric looping process (the first gross evidence of left-right asymmetry in the developing embryo), which positions the portion of the heart tube destined to become the left ventricle to the left of the more rostral precursors of the right ven-tricle and outflow tract. Looping is coordinated with chamber specifi-cation and ballooning of various regions of the heart tube to produce the presumptive atria and ventricles. Relatively recent work has demonstrated that significant portions of the right ventricle are formed by cells that are added to the"
