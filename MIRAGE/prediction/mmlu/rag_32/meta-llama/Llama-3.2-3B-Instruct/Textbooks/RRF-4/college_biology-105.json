    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step: A. High temperature increases the rate of transpiration from plants. When the temperature is high, the rate of evaporation from the plant's surface increases, leading to a higher rate of transpiration. So, this option increases the rate of transpiration. B. High relative humidity actually decreases the rate of transpiration from plants. When the relative humidity is high, the air is more saturated with water vapor, making it more difficult for water to evaporate from the plant's surface. As a result, the rate of transpiration decreases. So, this option does not increase the rate of transpiration. C. Low relative humidity increases the rate of transpiration from plants. When the relative humidity is low, the air is less saturated with water vapor, making it easier for water to evaporate from the plant's surface. As a result, the rate of transpiration increases. So, this option increases the rate of transpiration. D. Wind can increase the rate of transpiration from plants. Wind can help to speed up the evaporation of water from the plant's surface, leading to a higher rate of transpiration. So, this option increases the rate of transpiration. After analyzing each option, we can conclude that the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The correct answer is B. high relative humidity, as it decreases the rate of transpiration from plants. High relative humidity makes the air more saturated with water vapor, making it more difficult for water to evaporate from the plant's surface.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

When the pH in the environment drops, for example, the flux of H+ into the cytosol is balanced, at least in part, by an increased transport of H+ into the vacuole, which tends to keep the pH in the cytosol constant. Similarly, many plant cells maintain an almost constant turgor pressure despite large changes in the tonicity of the fluid in their immediate environment. They do so by changing the osmotic pressure of the cytosol and vacuole\u2014in part by the controlled breakdown and resynthesis of polymers such as polyphosphate in the vacuole, and in part by altering the transport rates of sugars,"

Although the fluid in the plant cell wall contains more solutes than does the water in the plant\u2019s external milieu (for example, soil), it is still hypotonic in comparison with the cell interior. This osmotic imbalance causes the cell to develop a large internal hydrostatic pressure, or turgor pressure, which pushes outward on the cell wall, just as an inner tube pushes outward on a tire. The turgor pressure increases just to the point where the cell is in osmotic equilibrium, with no net influx of water despite the salt imbalance. The turgor pressure generated in this way may reach 10 or more atmospheres, about five times that in the average car tire. This pressure is vital to plants because it is the main driving force for cell expansion during growth, and it provides much of the mechanical rigidity of living plant tissues.

Such charge differences can result both from active electrogenic pumping (see p. 608) and from passive ion diffusion. As we discuss in Chapter 14, electrogenic H+ pumps in the mitochondrial inner membrane generate most of the membrane potential across this membrane. Electrogenic pumps also generate most of the electrical potential across the plasma membrane in plants and fungi.

This carboxylation reaction is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by a large enzyme called ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, or Rubisco for short. Because the reaction is so slow (each Rubisco molecule turns over only about 3 molecules of substrate per second, compared to 1000 molecules per second for a typical enzyme), an unusually large number of enzyme molecules are needed. Rubisco often constitutes more than 50% of the chloroplast protein mass, and it is thought to be the most abundant protein on Earth. In a global context, Rubisco also keeps the amount of the greenhouse gas CO2 in the atmosphere at a low level."

Water is a very low-energy molecule and is thus very stable; it can serve as an electron donor only when a large amount of energy from an external source is spent on splitting it into protons, electrons, and molecular oxygen.

As depicted in Fig. 2.1 , there are multiple inputs and outputs of water, many of which can vary but nevertheless cannot be regulated. For example, the amount of water lost through the lungs depends on the humidity of the air and the rate of respiration (e.g., low humidity and rapid breathing increase water loss from the lungs). Similarly, the amount of water lost as sweat varies according to ambient temperature and physical activity. Finally, water loss via the gastrointestinal tract can increase from a normal level of 100 to 200 mL/day to many liters with acute diarrhea. Of these inputs and outputs, the only two that can be regulated are increased ingestion of water in response to thirst and alterations in urine output by the kidneys (see Chapter 35)."

Some living things (e.g., rockfish and the bristlecone pine, sometimes called the Methuselah tree) undergo negligible senes-cence, whereas others die almost immediately after reproduction is completed (e.g., semelparous animals and annual plants). Programmed death. The first evolutionary theory of aging was proposed by Weissman in 1882. This theory states that aging and death are programmed and have evolved to remove older animals from the population so that environmental resources such as food and water are freed up for younger members of the species."

            "content": "To illustrate the concept of steady-state balance, consider a river on which a dam is built to create a synthetic lake. Each day, water enters the lake from the various streams and rivers that feed it. In addition, water is added by underground springs, rain, and snow. At the same time, water is lost through the spillways of the dam and by the process of evaporation. For the level of the lake to remain constant (i.e., steady-state balance), the rate at which water is added, regardless of source, must be exactly matched by the amount of water lost, again regardless of route. Because the addition of water is not easily controlled and the loss by evaporation cannot be controlled, the only way to maintain a constant level of the lake is to regulate the amount that is lost through the spillways. To understand steady-state balance as it applies to the human body, the following key concepts are important. 1."

            "content": "plant and fungal vacuoles are remarkably versatile lysosomes Most plant and fungal cells (including yeasts) contain one or several very large, fluid-filled vesicles called vacuoles. They typically occupy more than 30% of the cell volume, and as much as 90% in some cell types (Figure 13\u201340). Vacuoles are related to animal cell lysosomes and contain a variety of hydrolytic enzymes, but their functions are remarkably diverse. The plant vacuole can act as a storage organelle for both nutrients and waste products, as a degradative compartment, as an economical way of increasing cell size, and as a controller of turgor pressure (the osmotic pressure that pushes outward on the cell wall and keeps the plant from wilting) (Figure 13\u201341). The same cell may have different vacuoles with distinct functions, such as digestion and storage."
