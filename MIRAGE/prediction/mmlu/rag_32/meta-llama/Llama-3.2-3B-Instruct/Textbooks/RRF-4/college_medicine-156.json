As discussed above, a typical gene carries in its linear sequence of nucleotides the information for the linear sequence of the amino acids of a protein. Only about 1300 nucleotide pairs are required to encode a protein of average size (about 430 amino acids in humans). Most of the remaining sequence in a gene consists of long stretches of noncoding DNA that interrupt the relatively short segments of DNA that code for protein. As will be discussed in detail in Chapter 6, the coding sequences are called exons; the intervening (noncoding) sequences in genes are called introns (see Figure 4\u201315 and Table 4\u20131). The majority of human genes thus consist of a long string of alternating exons and introns, with most of the gene consisting of introns. In contrast, the majority of genes from organisms with concise genomes lack introns. This accounts for the much smaller size of their genes"

Discovered 5\u02dc 3\u02dc in 1977, this feature of eukaryotic genes came as a surprise to scientists, who had been, until that time, familiar only with bacterial genes, which typically consist of a continuous stretch of coding DNA that is directly transcribed into mRNA. In marked contrast, eukaryotic genes were found to be broken up into small pieces of coding sequence (expressed sequences or exons) interspersed with much longer intervening sequences or introns; thus, the coding portion of a eukaryotic gene is often only a small fraction of the length of the gene (Figure 6\u201324)."

Although a sequence match does not guarantee similarity in function, it has proved to be an excellent clue. Thus, it is often possible to predict the function of genes in humans for which no biochemical or genetic information is available simply by comparing their nucleotide sequences with the sequences of genes that have been characterized in other more readily studied organisms. In general, the sequences of individual genes are much more tightly conserved than is overall genome structure. Features of genome organization such as genome size, number of chromosomes, order of genes along chromosomes, abundance and size of introns, and amount of repetitive DNA are found to differ greatly when comparing distant organisms, as does the number of genes that each organism contains."

Perhaps the most important concept, one that applies to all species on Earth, is based on a group of proteins known as transcription regulators. These proteins recognize specific sequences of DNA (typically 5\u201310 nucleotide pairs in length) that are often called cis-regulatory sequences, because they must be on the same chromosome (that is, in cis) to the genes they control. Transcription regulators bind to these sequences, which are dispersed throughout genomes, and this binding puts into motion a series of reactions that ultimately specify which genes are to be transcribed and at what rate. Approximately 10% of the protein-coding genes of most organisms are devoted to transcription regulators, making them one of the largest classes of proteins in the cell. In most cases, a given transcription regulator recognizes its own cis-regulatory sequence, which is different from those recognized by all the other"

Historically, genes were identified because they conferred specific traits that are transmitted from one generation to the next. Increasingly, they are characterized based on expression in various tissues (transcriptome). The size of genes is quite broad; some genes are only a few hundred base pairs, whereas others are extraordinarily large (2 Mb). The number of genes greatly underestimates the complexity of genetic expression, because single genes can generate multiple spliced messenger RNA (mRNA) products (isoforms), which are translated into proteins that are subject to complex posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation.

Although this strategy is often successful, it typically provides only the likely biochemical function of the protein; for example, whether the protein resembles a kinase or a protease. It usually remains for the experimenter to verify (or refute) this assignment and, most importantly, to discover the protein\u2019s biological function in the whole organism; that is, to what attributes of the organism does the kinase or the protease contribute and in what molecular pathways does it function? Nowadays, most new proteins are \u201cdiscovered\u201d"

Splicing: Maturation of eukaryotic mRNA usually involves removal from the primary transcript of RNA sequences (introns or intervening sequences) that do not code for protein. The remaining coding (expressed) sequences, the exons, are joined together to form the mature mRNA. The process of removing introns and joining exons is called splicing. The molecular complex that accomplishes these tasks is known as the spliceosome. A few eukaryotic primary transcripts contain no introns (for example, those from histone genes). Others contain a few introns, whereas some, such as the primary transcripts for the \u03b1 chains of collagen, contain >50 introns that must be removed."

If drawn with a 1 mm space between each nucleotide pair, as in (A), the human genome would extend 3200 km (approximately 2000 miles), far enough to stretch across the center of Africa, the site of our human origins (red line in b). At this scale, there would be, on average, a protein-coding gene every 150 m. An average gene would extend for 30 m, but the coding sequences in this gene would add up to only just over a meter."

            "content": "In the preceding section, we have seen that the final product of some genes is an RNA molecule itself, such as the RNAs present in the snRNPs and in ribosomes. However, most genes in a cell produce mRNA molecules that serve as intermediaries on the pathway to proteins. In this section, we examine how the cell converts the information carried in an mRNA molecule into a protein molecule. This feat of translation was a strong focus of attention for biologists in the late 1950s, when it was posed as the \u201ccoding problem\u201d: how is the information in a linear sequence of nucleotides in RNA translated into the linear sequence of a chemically quite different set of units\u2014the amino acids in proteins? This fascinating question stimulated great excitement. Here was a cryptogram set up by nature that, after more than 3 billion years of evolution, could finally be solved by one of the products of evolution\u2014human beings. And indeed, not only was the code cracked step by step, but in the year 2000 the"

            "content": "The human genome encompasses the entire length of human DNA that contains the genetic information packaged in all 46 chromosomes. Sequencing of the human genome took about 13 years and was successfully completed in 2003 by the Human Genome Project. The human genome contains a 2.85-billion base pair consensus sequence of nucleotides, which are arranged in about 23,000 protein-coding genes. For years it was thought that genes were usually present in two copies in a genome. However, recent discoveries have revealed that large segments of DNA can vary in numbers of copies. Such copy number variations (CNVs) are widespread in the human genome and most likely lead to genetic imbalances. For instance, genes that were thought to always occur in two copies per genome have sometimes one, three, or more copies. A previous definition of a gene as a segment of DNA involved in producing a polypeptide chain has been recently updated to now read as being a union of genomic sequences encoding a"

            "content": "The genetic master plan of an organism is contained in the sequence of deoxyribonucleotides in its DNA. However, it is through ribonucleic acid (RNA), the \u201cworking copies\u201d of DNA, that the master plan is expressed (Fig. 31.1). The copying process, during which a DNA strand serves as a template for the synthesis of RNA, is called transcription. Transcription produces messenger RNA (mRNA), which are translated into sequences of amino acids (proteins), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and additional RNA molecules that perform specialized structural, catalytic, and regulatory functions and are not translated. That is, they are noncoding RNA (ncRNA). Therefore, the final product of gene expression can be RNA or protein, depending upon the gene. [Note: Only ~2% of the genome encodes proteins.] A central feature of transcription is that it is highly selective. For example, many transcripts are made of some regions of the DNA. In other regions, few or no transcripts are made."
