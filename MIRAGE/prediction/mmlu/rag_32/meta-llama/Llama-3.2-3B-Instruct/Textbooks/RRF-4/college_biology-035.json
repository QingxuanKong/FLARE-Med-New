Alternation of generations is a life cycle characteristic of plants, including ferns, where a diploid (sporophyte) generation produces spores that develop into a haploid (gametophyte) generation. Step 2: Analyze the options provided. - Option A: \"dominant sporophyte alternates with an independent gametophyte\" is a correct description of the alternation of generations in ferns. - Option B: \"dominant gametophyte alternates with a dependent sporophyte\" is incorrect as ferns have a dominant sporophyte generation. - Option C: \"sporophyte and a gametophyte have equal life spans\" is not accurate as the sporophyte generation is typically dominant and longer-lived. - Option D: \"gametophyte produces gametes by meiosis\" is incorrect as the gametophyte generation produces gametes through mitosis, not meiosis. Step 3: Select the correct answer based on the analysis. ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alternation of generations in ferns involves a dominant diploid sporophyte generation producing spores that develop into a haploid gametophyte generation.

Studies in such organisms have revealed rare cases in which the parceling out of genes violates the standard genetic rules. Occasionally, for example, meiosis yields three copies of the maternal version of a gene and only one copy of the paternal allele. Alternative versions of the same gene are called alleles, and it is the divergence from their expected distribution during meiosis that is known as gene conversion. Genetic studies show that only small sections of DNA typically undergo gene conversion, and in many cases only a part of a gene is changed."

In other plants, the chloroplast precursors from the pollen grains enter the zygote, making chloroplast inheritance biparental. In such plants, defective chloroplasts are a cause of variegation: a mixture of normal and defective chloroplasts in a zygote may sort out by mitotic segregation during plant growth and development, thereby producing alternating green and white patches in leaves. Leaf cells in the green patches contain normal chloroplasts, while those in the white patches contain defective chloroplasts (Figure 14\u201368)."

This doubling results from somatic cell growth: although the cells no longer divide, they continue to go through rounds of DNA synthesis; this endoreplication of the genome makes the cells polyploid. As in all organisms, the size of a cell is proportional to its ploidy\u2014that is, the number of genome copies that it contains: a doubling of ploidy roughly doubles cell volume. By artificial manipulation of somatic cell ploidy, and thereby somatic cell size, the size of the worm as a whole can be increased or decreased.

In many organisms, the haploid cells differentiate into specialized reproductive cells called gametes\u2014eggs and sperm in most species. In these species, the reproductive cycle ends when a sperm and egg fuse to form a diploid zygote, which has the potential to form a new individual.

The whole control system governing the switch to flowering is thus of vital importance for agriculture, especially in an era of rapid climate change.

It may be that in other organisms\u2014animals as well as plants\u2014slow, progressive changes in chromatin structure provide long-term timers for those mysterious developmental processes that unfold slowly, over a period of days, weeks, months, or years.

We have seen that germ cells must be protected against high rates of mutation to maintain the species. However, the somatic cells of multicellular organisms must also be protected from genetic change to properly maintain the organized structure of the body. Nucleotide changes in somatic cells can give rise to variant cells, some of which, through \u201clocal\u201d natural selection, proliferate rapidly at the expense of the rest of the organism. In an extreme case, the result is the uncontrolled cell proliferation that we know as cancer, a disease that causes (in Europe and North America) more than 20% of human deaths each year.

These selectively neutral mutations can also spread and become fixed in a population, and they make a large contribution to evolutionary change in genomes. For example, as we saw earlier, they account for most of the DNA sequence differences between apes and humans. The spread of neutral mutations is not as rapid as the spread of the rare strongly advantageous mutations. It depends on a random variation in the number of mutation-bearing progeny produced by each mutation-bearing individual, causing changes in the relative frequency of the mutant allele in the population. Through a sort of \u201crandom walk\u201d process, the mutant allele may eventually become extinct, or it may become commonplace.

If the mutation has a significantly deleterious effect, it will simply be eliminated by purifying selection and will not become fixed. (In the most extreme case, the individual carrying the mutation will die without producing progeny.) Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population. Because humans reproduce sexually and genetic recombination occurs each time a gamete is formed (discussed in Chapter 5), the genome of each individual who has inherited the mutation will be a unique recombinational mosaic of segments inherited from a large number of ancestors. The selected mutation along with a modest amount of neighboring sequence\u2014ultimately inherited from the individual in which the mutation occurred\u2014will simply be one piece of this huge mosaic."

If the gland is removed or if thyroid hormone action is blocked, metamorphosis does not occur, although growth continues, producing a giant tadpole.

This is because there are 2N copies of the gene in the diploid population, and each of them has an equal chance of becoming the predominant version in the long run. For those mutations that do become fixed, the mathematics shows that the average time to fixation is approximately 4N generations. Detailed analyses of data on human genetic variation have suggested an ancestral population size of approximately 10,000 at the time when the current pattern of genetic variation was largely established. With a population that has reached this size, the probability that a new, selectively neutral mutation would become fixed is small (1/20,000), while the average time to fixation would be on the order of 800,000 years (assuming a 20-year generation time).

Cold over a period of weeks or months progressively reduces the level of expression of a remarkable gene called Flowering locus C (Flc). Flc encodes a transcriptional repressor that suppresses expression of the Ft flowering promoter. How does vernalization shut down Flc so as to lift the block to flowering? The effect involves a noncoding RNA called Coolair that overlaps with the Flc gene and is produced when the temperature is low (Figure 21\u201344). Together with cold-induced chromatin modifiers, including Polycomb-group proteins, Coolair coordinates the switching of Flc chromatin to a silent state (discussed in Chapters 4 and 7). The degree of silencing depends on the length of cold exposure enabling the plants to distinguish the odd chilly night from the whole of winter."

An egg of the seaweed Fucus gives rise to a Fucus seaweed (e and F). (A, courtesy of david mcclay; B, courtesy of m.

            "content": "Alternative polyadenylation: Some pre-mRNA transcripts have more than one site for cleavage and polyadenylation. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) generates mRNA with different 3\u2032-ends, altering the untranslated region (UTR) or the coding (translated) sequence. [Note: APA is involved in the production of the membrane-bound and secreted forms of immunoglobulin M.] The use of alternative splicing and polyadenylation sites, as well as alternative transcription start sites explains, at least in part, how the ~20,000 to 25,000 genes in the human genome can give rise to well over 100,000 proteins. 3. Messenger RNA editing: Even after mRNA has been fully processed, it may undergo an additional posttranscriptional modification in which a base in the mRNA is altered. This is known as RNA editing. An important example in humans occurs with the transcript for apolipoprotein (apo) B, an essential component of chylomicrons (see p."

            "content": "B. Messenger RNA processing and use Eukaryotic mRNA undergoes several processing events before it is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for use in protein synthesis. Capping at the 5\u2032-end (see p. 441), polyadenylation at the 3\u2032-end (see p. 442), and splicing (see p. 442) are essential for the production of a functional eukaryotic messenger from most pre-mRNA. Variations in splicing and polyadenylation can affect gene expression. In addition, messenger stability also affects gene expression. 1. Alternative splicing: Tissue-specific protein isoforms can be made from the same pre-mRNA through alternative splicing, which can involve exon skipping (loss), intron retention, and use of alternative splice-donor or -acceptor sites (Fig. 33.12). For example, the pre-mRNA for tropomyosin (TM) undergoes tissue-specific alternative splicing to yield a number of TM isoforms (see p. 443). [Note: Over 90% of all human genes undergo alternative splicing.] 2."

A mutation in a single gene coding for a regulatory protein causes leafy shoots (left) to develop in place of flowers, which occur in the normal plant (right). The mutation causes cells to adopt a character that would be appropriate to a different part of the normal plant, so instead of a flower, the cells produce a leafy shoot.
