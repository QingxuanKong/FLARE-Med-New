    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To determine the most likely location where the infectious agent began to proliferate, let's analyze the given information step by step. 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with a red, itchy rash on his buttocks and legs. This information alone could point towards several dermatological conditions. 2. **Recent Travel History**: The patient recently returned from a cruise to the Caribbean, where he engaged in activities like swimming in the pool and using the hot tub. This suggests exposure to potential waterborne pathogens. 3. **Symptoms and Signs**: The fact that the patient is otherwise asymptomatic and has normal vital signs suggests that the infection is likely not severe or systemic at this point. 4. **Photograph Mentioned**: Although we cannot see the photograph, the fact that it is mentioned implies that it is relevant to the diagnosis. Given these clues, we can consider common waterborne pathogens that cause skin rashes and are commonly associated with swimming pools and hot tubs. One notable pathogen is *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, which can cause a range of infections, including a skin condition known as pseudomonas folliculitis. **Step-by-Step Analysis**: - **Apocrine Glands (A)**: While apocrine glands are involved in sweat production, they are not the primary site for *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infections. - **Dermis (B)**: The dermis is the layer of skin beneath the epidermis, but *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infections typically target hair follicles rather than the dermis directly. - **Eccrine Glands (C)**: Eccrine glands are responsible for sweat production, which is relevant given the patient's swimming and hot tub activities. *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* thrives in moist environments and can infect eccrine glands, leading to conditions like pseudomonas folliculitis or folliculitis. - **Hair Follicle (D)**: Hair follicles are the primary site for *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infections, especially in the context of swimming pools and hot tubs. These infections often manifest as folliculitis, characterized by inflammation of the hair follicles. **Conclusion**: Given the patient's recent swimming and hot tub activities, the presence of a red, itchy rash, and the nature of the infection, the most likely location where the infectious agent began to proliferate is the **hair follicle**. ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient\\u2019s recent swimming and hot tub activities, combined with the nature of the rash and the typical habitat of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, point towards a hair follicle infection. The eccrine glands are also a consideration given the moist environment, but the hair follicle is the primary site for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"} ```",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

The examining physician discovers postural hypotension and moderate vitiligo (depigmented areas of skin) and obtains routine blood tests. She finds hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis and suspects Addison\u2019s disease. She performs a standard ACTH 1\u201324 stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response compatible with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency. The diagnosis of autoimmune Addison\u2019s disease is made, and the patient must start replacement of the hormones he cannot produce himself. How should this patient be treated? What precautions should he take?"

He has hypertension, and during the last 8 years, he has been adequately managed with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem? What information would you gather to confirm your diagnosis? What treatment steps would you initiate?"

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

            "content": "The classic rash of ARF is erythema marginatum (Chap. 24), which begins as pink macules that clear centrally, leaving a serpiginous, spreading edge. The rash is evanescent, appearing and disappearing before the examiner\u2019s eyes. It occurs usually on the trunk, sometimes on the limbs, but almost never on the face. Subcutaneous nodules occur as painless, small (0.5\u20132 cm), mobile lumps beneath the skin overlying bony prominences, particularly of the hands, feet, elbows, occiput, and occasionally the vertebrae. They are a delayed manifestation, appearing 2\u20133 weeks after the onset of disease, last for just a few days up to 3 weeks, and are commonly associated with carditis. Fever occurs in most cases of ARF, although rarely in cases of pure chorea. Although high-grade fever (\u226539\u00b0C) is the rule, lower grade temperature elevations are not uncommon. Elevated acute-phase reactants are also present in most cases."

Several of LT\u2019s teeth were loose, including one that anchors his dental bridge. Several black and blue marks (ecchymoses) were noted on the legs, and an unhealed sore was present on the right wrist. Inspection of his scalp revealed tiny red spots (petechiae) around some of the hair follicles. Blood was drawn for testing. Results of tests on LT\u2019s blood: The test for blood in his stool (occult blood test) was negative. Results of follow-up tests (obtained several days after the appointment) included the following: H = High; L = Low. Diagnosis: LT has vitamin C deficiency with a microcytic, hypochromic anemia secondary to the deficiency. Treatment: LT was prescribed vitamin C (as oral ascorbic acid) and iron (as oral ferrous sulfate) supplements. He will also be referred to social services. Prognosis: The prognosis for recovery is excellent."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"
