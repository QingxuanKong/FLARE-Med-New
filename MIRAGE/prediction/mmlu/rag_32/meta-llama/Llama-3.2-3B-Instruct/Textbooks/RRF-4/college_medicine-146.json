    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the role of ATP in muscle cells and how it is replenished during exercise. According to document [0], the ATP pool in skeletal muscle is small and can only support a few contractions if not replenished. However, the ATP pool is continually replenished during contraction, especially during intense exercise. Document [1] states that creatine phosphate, which is used to convert ADP to ATP, is the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise. Document [2] explains that the ATP yields from glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation are 2 and 37 mol per mole of glucose 1-phosphate, respectively. However, during intense exercise, the muscle uses carbohydrate-derived ATP rapidly, and the ATP pool is replenished by phosphocreatine and ADP. According to document [1], the creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise. Document [3] states that the ATP store in muscle can only supply energy for a short period, and the ATP is constantly resynthesized. Considering these points, we can infer that the ATP store in muscle can only supply energy for a short duration, likely a few seconds, during high-intensity exercise. Given the options provided, the most plausible answer is C. 10 seconds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of ATP near the myosin heads during muscle contraction. The phosphate store created, however, is only about five times the size of the ATP store and thus cannot support prolonged periods of contraction (less than a minute of maximal muscle activity). Skeletal muscle fatigue during intense exercise is associated with depletion of the creatine phosphate store, although as described subsequently, this does not necessarily imply that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store. Because the creatine phosphokinase\u2013catalyzed reaction is reversible, the muscle cell replenishes the creatine phosphate pool during recovery from fatigue by using ATP synthesized through oxidative phosphorylation."

Blood glucose yields 36 mol of ATP per mole of glucose because 1 ATP is used to phosphorylate glucose at the start of glycolysis.

As stated earlier, the circumstances during exercise are somewhat different. During a short period of intense exercise, the muscle uses carbohydrate derived from glycogen stores; myophosphorylase is the enzyme that initiates the metabolism of glycogen. With longer aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen stores, energy is provided by oxidation of fatty acids. Thus, muscle failure at a certain phase of exercise is predictive of the type of energy failure.

            "content": "Table 12.2 ). Fast muscle fibers also have a larger diameter than do slow muscle fibers. Thus recruitment of fast motor units can help meet the increased demands of burst activities such as weightlifting. The high myosin ATPase activity in fast muscle fibers and the increase in diffusion distance (resulting from the large diameter of the fast muscle fibers), however, increase the susceptibility of fast muscle fibers to fatigue. Additional differences between fast and slow muscles include the following: 1. The motor neuron in slow muscle is more easily excited than that in fast muscle, and so slow muscles are typically recruited first. As stated previously, the high oxidative capacity of slow muscle, coupled with the low myosin ATPase activity, helps reduce the susceptibility to fatigue in slow muscle. 2."
