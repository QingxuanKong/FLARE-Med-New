Insulin (B) is primarily involved in glucose regulation, adrenaline (C) is involved in the 'fight or flight' response, and testosterone (D) is involved in reproductive functions. However, the question specifically asks about fluid regulation. The correct answer must be a hormone that plays a direct role in regulating fluid balance in the body. Antidiuretic hormone (A) is directly involved in regulating the amount of water in the body by acting on the kidneys to either reabsorb or excrete water, thus directly impacting fluid balance.

Indeed, patients suffering from bowel inflammation often show markedly diminished expression of ENaC, perhaps accounting for their diarrheal symptoms. We also know that expression of ENaC can be acutely regulated in response to whole-body Na+ balance. Thus in situations of reduced Na+ intake, the hormone aldosterone increases ENaC expression in both the colon and kidney, thereby promoting retention of Na+ . Adequate hydration of the colonic contents is determined by the balance between water absorption and secretion. Fluid secretion in the colon is driven by Cl\u2212 ion secretion, by the same mechanism driving fluid secretion in the small intestine, and is subject to the same regulation (see Fig. 30.18)."

            "content": "2. Excretion of K+ by the kidneys is determined by the rate and direction of K+ transport by the distal tubule and collecting duct. Secretion of K+ by these tubular segments is regulated by plasma [K+], aldosterone, and AVP. In contrast, changes in tubular fluid flow and acid-base disturbances perturb K+ excretion by the kidneys. In K+-depleted states, K+ secretion is inhibited and the distal tubule and collecting duct reabsorb K+ . 3. The kidneys, in conjunction with the intestinal tract and bone, play a vital role in regulating plasma [Ca++] and [Pi]. 4. Plasma [Ca++] is regulated by PTH and calcitriol. Calcitonin is not a major regulatory hormone in humans. Ca++ excretion by the kidneys is regulated by PTH, plasma [Ca++], and calcitriol and is altered by changes in acid-base status, ECFV, and plasma Pi. 5. Ca++ reabsorption by the TAL and distal tubule are regulated by PTH and calcitriol, both of which stimulate Ca++ reabsorption, and by plasma [Ca++]. 6."

The kidneys regulate (1) body fluid osmolality and volumes, (2) electrolyte balance, and (3) acid-base balance. In addition the kidneys excrete metabolic products and foreign substances and produce and secrete hormones."
