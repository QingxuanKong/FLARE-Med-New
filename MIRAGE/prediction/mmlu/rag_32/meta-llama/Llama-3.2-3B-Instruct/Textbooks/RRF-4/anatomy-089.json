OVERVIEW Collagen and elastin are examples of common, well-characterized fibrous proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that serve structural functions in the body. For example, collagen and elastin are found as components of skin, connective tissue, blood vessel walls, and the sclera and cornea of the eye. Each fibrous protein exhibits special mechanical properties, resulting from its unique structure, which is obtained by combining specific amino acids into regular, secondary structural elements. This is in contrast to globular proteins (discussed in Chapter 3), whose shapes are the result of complex interactions between secondary, tertiary, and, sometimes, quaternary structural elements. II.

Collagen contains an abundance of proline, lysine, and glycine, the latter occurring at every third position in the primary structure. It also contains hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, and glycosylated hydroxylysine, each formed by posttranslational modification. Fibrillar collagen has a long, rigid structure, in which three collagen polypeptide \u03b1 chains are wound around one another in a rope-like triple helix stabilized by interchain hydrogen bonds. Diseases of fibrillar collagen synthesis affect bones, joints, skin, and blood vessels. Elastin is a connective tissue protein with rubber-like properties in tissues such as the lung. \u03b11-Antitrypsin (AAT), produced primarily by the liver, inhibits elastase-catalyzed degradation of elastin in the alveolar walls. A deficiency of AAT increases elastin degradation and can cause emphysema and, in some cases, cirrhosis of the liver."

Collagen types IV and VII are also found in much smaller quantities in the dermo-epidermal junction. The structure of the fibers varies along the depth of the dermis. At the superficial part of the dermis, in the papillary layer, the collagen bundles are arranged more loosely and are primarily made up of type III collagen.22 Deeper in the reticular layer of the dermis, the col-lagen fibrils are larger in diameter and organized into interwo-ven bundles surrounded by elastic fibers all within the hydrated ground substance.

            "content": "Some collagen types (e.g., types I, II, III, and V collagens) form linear fibrils stabilized by interchain hydrogen bonding; such fibrillar collagens form a major proportion of the connective tissue in structures such as bone, tendon, cartilage, blood vessels, and skin, as well as in healing wounds and scars. The tensile strength of the fibrillar collagens derives from lateral crosslinking of the triple helices by covalent bonds, an unusual A Fibrillar collagen and elastin B Proteoglycan C bFGF regulation by association with the extracellular matrix"

            "content": "With both the TEM and SEM, elastin appears as an amorphous structure of low electron density. In contrast, the fibrillin microfibrils are electron dense and are readily apparent even within the elastin matrix (Fig. 6.15). In mature fibers, the fibrillin microfibrils are located within the elastic fiber and at its periphery. The presence of microfibrils within the fiber is associated with the growth process; thus, as the fiber is formed and thickens, the microfibrils become entrapped within the newly deposited elastin. \u0081 FOLDER 6.2 Clinical Correlation: Sun Exposure and Molecular Changes in Photoaged Skin"

            "content": "Collagen types IX and XII are called fibril-associated collagens because they decorate the surface of collagen fibrils. They are thought to link these fibrils to one another and to other components in the extracellular matrix. Type IV is a network-forming collagen, forming a major part of basal laminae, while type VII molecules form dimers that assemble into specialized structures called anchoring fibrils. Anchoring fibrils help attach the basal lamina of multilayered epithelia to the underlying connective tissue and therefore are especially abundant in the skin. There are also a number of \u201ccollagen-like\u201d proteins containing short collagen-like segments. These include collagen type XVII, which has a transmembrane domain and is found in hemidesmosomes, and type XVIII, the core protein of a proteoglycan in basal laminae."

This atomic force microscopic image of type I collagen fibrils in the connective tissue shows the banding pattern on the surface of collagen fibrils.

Along with proline and hydroxyproline, the glycine is essential for the triple-helix conformation (see Fig. 6.7e). Associated with the helix are sugar groups that are joined to hydroxylysyl residues. Because of these sugar groups, collagen is properly described as a glycoprotein."

            "content": "A type of connective tissue found in close association with most epithelia is loose connective tissue (Fig. 4.2a). In fact, it is the connective tissue that most epithelia rest on. The extracellular matrix of loose connective tissue contains loosely arranged collagen fibers and numerous cells. Some of these cells, the fibroblasts, form and maintain the extracellular matrix. However, most of the cells are migrants from the vascular system and have roles associated with the immune system. In contrast, where only strength is required, collagen fibers are more numerous and densely packed. Also, the cells are relatively sparse and limited to the fiber-forming cell, the fibroblast (Fig. 4.2b). This type of connective tissue is described as dense connective tissue."
