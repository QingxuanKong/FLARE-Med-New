Chromosome numbers such as 3n and 4n are called polyploid. Polyploidy generally results in a spontaneous abortion. Any number that is not an exact multiple of n is called aneuploid. The chief cause of aneuploidy is nondisjunction of a homologous pair of chromosomes at the first meiotic division or a failure of sister chromatids to separate during the second meiotic division. The latter also may occur during mitosis in somatic cells, leading to the production of two aneuploid cells. Failure of pairing of homologous chromosomes followed by random assortment (anaphase lag) also can lead to aneuploidy. When nondisjunction occurs at the time of meiosis, the gametes formed have either an extra chromosome (n + 1) or one less chromosome (n \u2212 1). Fertilization of such gametes by normal gametes would result in two types of zygotes: trisomic, with an extra chromosome (2n"

The 3 \u00d7 109 base pairs that 83e encode the human genome are packaged into 23 pairs of chromosomes, which consist of discrete portions of DNA, bound to several classes of regulatory proteins. Technical advances that led to the ability to analyze human chromosomes immediately translated into the revelation that human disorders can be caused by an abnormality of chromosome number. In 1959, the clinically recognizable disorder, Down syndrome, was demonstrated to result from having three copies of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21).

In the process, although the number of chromosomes is similar in the two species (23 per haploid genome in the human versus 20 in the mouse), their overall structures differ greatly. Nonetheless, even after the extensive genomic shuffling, there are many large blocks of DNA in which the gene order is the same in the human and the mouse.

Aneuploidy is defined as a number of chromosomes that is not a multiple of the haploid state; for humans, that is a chromosome number that is not a multiple of 23. Aneuploidy is remarkably common in cancers, particularly carcinomas, and was proposed as a cause of carcinogenesis over 100 years ago. Aneuploidy frequently results from errors of the mitotic checkpoint, the major cell cycle control mechanism that acts to prevent mistakes in chromosome segregation. The mitotic checkpoint prevents aneuploidy by inhibiting the irreversible transition to anaphase until all of the replicated chromosomes have made productive attachments to spindle microtubules. Complete absence of the mitotic checkpoint leads to rapid cell death as a consequence of abnormal chromosome segregation."

            "content": "Molar pregnancies typically arise from chromosomally abnormal fertilizations Figure 20-2. Complete moles most often have a diploid chromosomal composition (Table These usually are 46,X and result from androgenesis, meaning both sets of chromosomes are paternal in origin. The chromosomes of the ovum are either absent or inactivated. The ovum is fertilized by a haploid sperm, which then duplicates its own chromosomes after meiosis. Less commonly, the chromosomal pattern may be 46,Y or 46,X and due to fertilization by two sperm, that is, dispermic ertilization or dispermy (Lawler, 1991; Lipata, 2010). 23,Y FIGURE 20-2 Typical pathogenesis of complete and partial moles. A. A 46,XX complete mole may be formed if a 23,x-bearing haploid sperm penetrates a 23,X-containing haploid egg whose genes have been \"inactivated.\" Paternal chromosomes then duplicate to create a 46,XX diploid complement solely of paternal origin."

            "content": "Because there are four a-globin genes, the inheritance of a-thalassemia is more complicated than for 3-thalassemia (Piel, 2014). Possible genotypes and phenotypes are shown in Table 56-4. Clinical severity closely correlates with the degree of a-globin chains synthesis impairment. In most populations, the a-globin chain \"cluster\" or gene loci are doubled on chromosome 16. Similarly, ther, chains are duplicated. Thus, the normal genotype for diploid cells can be expressed as ../.. and \"r /,,. here are two main groups of a-thalassemia determinants: .0-thalassemia is the deletion of both loci from one chromosome (--/..), whereas .+ -thalassemia is the loss of a single locus from one allele (-./.. heterozygote) or a loss from each allele (-./-.homozygote). here are two major phenotypes. he deletion of all four a-globin chain genes (--/--) characterizes homozygous a-thalassemia. Because a-chains are contained in fetal hemoglobin, the fetus is afected. When none of the four genes"

            "content": "Chromosome changes can occur during meiosis or mitosis and can occur at any point across the lifespan. Mosaicism for a developmental disorder is one consequence of mitotic chromosome abnormalities, and another consequence is cancer, when the chromosome change 83e-7 confers a growth or proliferation advantage on the cell. The types of chromosome abnormalities seen in cancer are similar to those seen in the developmental disorders (e.g., aneuploidy, deletion, duplication, translocation, isochromosomes, rings, inversion). Tumor cells often have multiple chromosome changes, some of which happen early in the development of a tumor, and may contribute to its selective advantage, whereas others are secondary effects of the deregulation that characterizes many tumors. Chromosome changes in cancer have been studied extensively and have been shown to provide important diagnostic, classification, and prognostic information. The identification of cancer type\u2013specific translocation breakpoints has"

            "content": "The typical hydatidiform mole is a voluminous mass of swollen, sometimes cystically dilated, chorionic villi, appearing grossly as grapelike structures. Varying amounts of normal to highly atypical chorionic epithelium cover the swollen villi. There are two distinctive subtypes of hydatidiform moles: complete and partial. Complete hydatidiform moles are not compatible with embryogenesis and rarely contain fetal parts. All of the chorionic villi are abnormal, and the chorionic epithelial cells are diploid (46,XX or, uncommonly, 46,XY). The partial hydatidiform mole is compatible with early embryo formation and therefore may contain fetal parts, has some normal chorionic villi, and is almost always triploid (e.g., 69,XXY) ( 19.5 ). Both types result from abnormal fertilization with an excess of paternal genetic material. In a complete mole the entire genetic content is supplied by two spermatozoa (or a diploid sperm), yielding diploid cells containing only paternal chromosomes, whereas"
