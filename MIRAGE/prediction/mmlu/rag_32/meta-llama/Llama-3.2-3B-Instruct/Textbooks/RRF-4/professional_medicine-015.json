The patient appears irritable and tense, and he is reading his symptoms from a written list, suggesting that he may not be fully engaged in the conversation. This could be indicative of a lack of insight or a defensive attitude. The patient's symptoms are also not being described in his own words, which is an important aspect of gathering a thorough history. Therefore, the most appropriate approach would be to encourage the patient to provide a narrative of the incident and his symptoms in his own words, rather than relying on a written list. This will allow for a more open-ended and spontaneous discussion, which is essential for gathering a comprehensive history. Options A, C, and D may not be as effective in encouraging the patient to provide a detailed and honest account of his symptoms and experiences.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" } ``` The reasoning behind this answer is based on the principles of effective interviewing, which emphasize the importance of creating a comfortable and non-confrontational environment, actively listening to the patient, and encouraging the patient to provide a narrative of their experiences and symptoms in their own words. By doing so, the interviewer can gather a more comprehensive and accurate history, which is essential for making an accurate diagnosis and developing an effective treatment plan.",

The impairments may emerge only in real-life situations when behavior is under minimal external control and may not be apparent within the structured environment of the medical office. Testing judgment by asking patients what they would do if they detected a fire in a theater or found a stamped and addressed envelope on the road is not very informative because patients who answer these questions wisely in the office may still act very foolishly in real-life settings.

Provide the bad news or other information to the patient and/or family sensitively. Identify the cause of the emotions\u2014 e.g., poor prognosis. Empathize with the patient and/or family\u2019s feelings. Explore by asking open-ended questions. Delineate for the patient and the family the next steps, including additional tests or interventions."

Common questions are \u201cShould I correct or argue with the patient?\u201d (No.) Orientation as to date, circumstances, and planned appointments is, however, helpful in preparing the patient for the day activities. \u201cCan the patient be left alone?\u201d \u201cMust I be there constantly?\u201d (Depends on specific circumstances and the severity of dementia.) \u201cShould the patient manage his own money?\u201d (Generally not.) \u201cWill a change of environment or a trip help?\u201d (Generally not; often the disruption in daily routine worsens behavior and orientation.) \u201cCan he drive?\u201d (Best to advise against driving in most instances.) \u201cWhat shall we do about the patient\u2019s fears at night and his hallucinations?\u201d (Medication under supervision may help.) \u201cWhen is a nursing home appropriate?\u201d \u201cHow will the condition worsen? What should the family expect, and when?\u201d (Uncertain, but usually a 5to 10-year course.) Many families have"

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms. Of note, he has no other illnesses. What is this patient\u2019s overall prognosis? Based on his prognosis, what"

We have no doubt that authentic traumatic neck injuries exist, even at times from minor trauma, but we are in accord with the above-mentioned authors that the high frequency of this putative injury is sustained by societal and legal structures."

However, potentially lethal injuries of internal organs can occur because the net energy transfer to any given location may be substantial.In blunt trauma, particular constellations of injury or injury patterns are associated with specific injury mechanisms. For example, when an unrestrained driver sustains a frontal impact, the head strikes the windshield, the chest and upper"
