    "question": "A 42-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 10 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was a restrained passenger. On arrival, she has shortness of breath and abdominal pain. Her pulse is 135/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 80/40 mm Hg. Breath sounds are decreased at the left lung base. An x-ray of the chest shows opacification of the left lower lung field with loss of the diaphragmatic shadow. Placement of a chest tube yields a small amount of air followed by greenish fluid.

The chest x-ray shows opacification of the left lower lung field with loss of the diaphragmatic shadow, which is consistent with a tension pneumothorax. The placement of a chest tube yields a small amount of air followed by greenish fluid, which is also consistent with a tension pneumothorax. Given the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most appropriate next step in management is to relieve the tension in the thoracic cavity to restore cardiac output and breathing. This can be done by performing a needle decompression of the pleural space through the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line. If this is not possible, thoracostomy should be performed. Therefore, option C (Thoracoscopy) is not the most appropriate next step, as it is not the initial treatment for tension pneumothorax. Option A (CT scan of the abdomen) and option B (CT scan of the chest) are not immediately necessary as the primary concern is the tension pneumothorax. Option D (Laparotomy) is also not the most appropriate next step as it is not indicated for tension pneumothorax and may even worsen the situation by increasing intra-abdominal pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis.

Pulsus paradoxus (i.e., an inspiratory reduction in systolic pressure >10 mmHg) may also be noted. The diagnosis is confirmed by echocardiography, and treatment consists of immediate pericardiocentesis or the creation of an open subxiphoid pericardial window.

He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

Blunt cardiac rupture, a rare event in trauma vic-tims who survive long enough to reach the hospital, can produce refractory shock and tamponade in the multiply-injured patient. The manifestations of cardiac tamponade, such as total circula-tory collapse and cardiac arrest, may be catastrophic, or they may be more subtle. A high index of suspicion is warranted to make a rapid diagnosis. Patients who present with circulatory arrest from cardiac tamponade require emergency pericardial decompression, usually through a left thoracotomy. The indi-cations for this maneuver are discussed in Chapter 7. Cardiac tamponade also may be associated with dyspnea, orthopnea, cough, peripheral edema, chest pain, tachycardia, muffled heart tones, jugular venous distention, and elevated central venous pressure. Beck\u2019s triad consists of hypotension, muffled heart tones, and neck vein distention. Unfortunately, absence of these clinical findings may not be sufficient to exclude cardiac injury"

The diagnosis of tension pneu-mothorax should be made on clinical examination. The classic findings include respiratory distress (in an awake patient), hypo-tension, diminished breath sounds over one hemithorax, hyper-resonance to percussion, jugular venous distention, and shift of mediastinal structures to the unaffected side with tracheal deviation. In most instances, empiric treatment with pleural decompression is indicated rather than delaying to wait for radiographic confirmation. When a chest tube cannot be imme-diately inserted, such as in the prehospital setting, the pleural space can be decompressed with a large caliber needle.
