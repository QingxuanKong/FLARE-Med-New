This concept was first introduced by paleontologist Niles Eldredge and biologist Stephen Jay Gould in 1972. The term refers to a model of evolution that describes the process of evolution as a series of rapid changes or speciation events (punctuations) followed by long periods of stability or stasis (equilibrium). This model is often contrasted with the traditional view of gradualism, which suggests that evolution occurs through a steady, continuous process. The punctuated equilibrium model suggests that species undergo rapid changes in response to environmental pressures, followed by periods of stability, and then another period of rapid change. This process repeats over time, resulting in a series of distinct species or lineages. The key concept to understand here is that punctuated equilibrium refers to bursts of speciation followed by relatively unchanging lineages. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The ability of these systems to function normally in the face of such perturbations is called robustness. If we understand a complex system to the extent that we can reproduce its behavior with a computational model, then the robustness of the system can be assessed by determining how well its normal function persists following changes in various parameters, such as rate constants and component concentrations. We have already seen, for example, how the presence of negative feedback reduces the sensitivity of the steady state to changes in the values of the system\u2019s parameters (see Figure 8\u201377). Considerations of robustness also apply to dynamic behaviors. Thus, for example, when discussing negative feedback, we described how the behavior of a system tends to become more oscillatory as the number of components that"

This is the central theme of dynamics, and it was for the solution of problems in dynamics that the techniques of calculus were developed, by Newton and Leibniz, in the seventeenth century. Briefly, the general problem is this: if we are given the rates of change of a set of variables that characterize the system at any instant, how can we compute its future state? The problem becomes especially interesting, and the predictions often remarkable, when the rates of change themselves depend on the values of the state variables, as in systems with feedback."

This can be seen, for example, if the number of components in a negative feedback loop increases, which leads to delays in the amount of time required for the cycle of signals to be completed. Figure 8\u201378 compares the behavior of two network motifs\u2014one with a three-stage and one with a five-stage negative feedback loop. Using the same kinetic parameters at each stage in the two loops, one finds that stable oscillations arise in the longer loop, while in the shorter loop the same parameters lead to relatively rapid convergence to a stable steady state."

For a small perturbation, the system returns to its original steady state. But the larger perturbation causes the system to switch to the alternate steady state. Thus, this system can be switched from one stable steady state to the other by subjecting it to an input (or a perturbation) that is large enough to make the other steady state more attractive. More generally, every stable steady state has a corresponding region of attraction, which can be intuitively thought of as the range of perturbations (of [X] or [Y] in this example) for which the dynamic trajectories converge back to that particular steady state, rather than switch to the other one."

Each day, water enters the lake from the various streams and rivers that feed it. In addition, water is added by underground springs, rain, and snow. At the same time, water is lost through the spillways of the dam and by the process of evaporation. For the level of the lake to remain constant (i.e., steady-state balance), the rate at which water is added, regardless of source, must be exactly matched by the amount of water lost, again regardless of route. Because the addition of water is not easily controlled and the loss by evaporation cannot be controlled, the only way to maintain a constant level of the lake is to regulate the amount that is lost through the spillways. To understand steady-state balance as it applies to the human body, the following key concepts are important. 1."

Once again, mathematics uncovers a simple but important concept that is not intuitively obvious: following a sudden increase in [A], [X] rises to a new steady state at an exponential rate that is inversely related to its lifetime; the faster X is degraded, the less time it takes it to reach its new steady-state value (Figure 8\u201374E).

We can incorporate these rates into the differential equation shown in Figure 8\u201373A (Equation 8\u20134).

Another branch\u2014normative economics\u2014seeks to prescribe what should happen and, in particular, what public policy should be developed to ensure that it happens. The main result of the application of normative economics is that, under certain very special assumptions, competitive markets result in a system in which no one can be made better off without another person\u2019s being made worse off. These assumptions do not hold in medical care, in part because of selection and moral hazard; economists term the result a market failure. By contrast, as the discussion of administered prices in this chapter indicates, even a beneficent regulator will introduce distortions from lack of sufficient information; moreover, there is no guarantee that a regulator will be beneficent, as periodic corruption scandals show. Economists term this phenomenon regulatory"

If a reaction reaches equilibrium, \u02dcG = 0, the reaction then proceeds at precisely equal rates in the forward and backward direction. For ATP hydrolysis, equilibrium is reached when the vast majority of the ATP has been hydrolyzed, as occurs in a dead cell."

            "content": "To understand how best to apply the principles of systems biology to human biomedicine, it is necessary to review briefly the building blocks of any biologic system and the determinants of system complexity. All systems can be analyzed by defining their static topology (architecture) and their dynamic (i.e., time-dependent) response to perturbation. In the discussion that follows, system properties are described that derive from the consequences of topology (form) or dynamic response (function). Any system of interacting elements can be represented schematically as a network in which the individual elements are depicted as nodes and their connections are depicted as links. The nature of the links among nodes reflects the degree of complexity of the system. Simple systems are those in which the nodes are linearly linked with occasional feedback or feedforward loops modulating system throughput in highly predictable ways. By contrast, complex systems are nodes that are linked in more"
