Tropism is a response of plant growth towards or away from a stimulus. The key difference between the options is the direction of the response. Thigmotropism is the response to touch, phototropism is the response to light, gravitropism is the response to gravity, and geotropism is the response to gravity. Gravitropism is the response to gravity, but it can be either positive (growing towards gravity) or negative (growing away from gravity). In the case of a plant growing along a trellis, the plant is growing towards the support, which is a response to gravity. Therefore, the correct answer is gravitropism. However, since the plant is growing towards the trellis, it is a positive gravitropism. The other options are not correct because thigmotropism is the response to touch, phototropism is the response to light, and gravidotropism is not a recognized term in plant biology.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

This small gas molecule (Figure 15\u201369A) can influence plant development in various ways; it can, for example, promote fruit ripening, leaf abscission, and plant senescence. It also functions as a stress signal in response to wounding, infection, flooding, and so on. When the shoot of a germinating seedling, for instance, encounters an obstacle, ethylene promotes a complex response that allows the seedling to safely bypass the obstacle (Figure 15\u201369B and C). Plants have various ethylene receptors, which are located in the endoplasmic reticulum and are all structurally related. They are dimeric, multipass transmembrane proteins, with a copper-containing ethylene-binding domain and a domain that interacts with a cytoplasmic protein called CTR1, which is closely related Figure 15\u201369 The ethylene-mediated triple response that occurs when the growing shoot of a germinating seedling encounters an obstacle underground."

Flowering involves a transformation of the behavior of the cells at the growing apex of the plant shoot\u2014the apical meristem. During ordinary vegetative growth, these cells behave as stem cells, generating a steady succession of new leaves and new segments of stalk. In flowering, the meristem cells switch to making the components of a flower, with its sepals and petals, its stamens carrying pollen, and its ovary containing the female gametes."

The manner of this expansion determines the final shape of each cell, and hence the final form of the plant as a whole. Turgor pressure inside the cell drives the expansion, but it is the behavior of the cell wall that governs its direction and extent. Complex wall-remodeling activities are required, as well as the deposition of new wall materials. Because of their crystalline structure, the individual cellulose microfibrils in the wall are unable to stretch, and this gives them a crucial role in the process. For the cell wall to stretch or deform, the microfibrils must either slide past one another or become more widely separated, or both. The orientation of the microfibrils in the innermost layers of the wall governs the direction in which the cell expands. Cells in plants therefore anticipate their future morphology by controlling the"

Although the fluid in the plant cell wall contains more solutes than does the water in the plant\u2019s external milieu (for example, soil), it is still hypotonic in comparison with the cell interior. This osmotic imbalance causes the cell to develop a large internal hydrostatic pressure, or turgor pressure, which pushes outward on the cell wall, just as an inner tube pushes outward on a tire. The turgor pressure increases just to the point where the cell is in osmotic equilibrium, with no net influx of water despite the salt imbalance. The turgor pressure generated in this way may reach 10 or more atmospheres, about five times that in the average car tire.

Four processes are fundamental to animal development: (1) cell proliferation, which produces many cells from one; (2) cell\u2013cell interactions, which coordinate the behavior of each cell with that of its neighbors; (3) cell specialization, or differentiation, which creates cells with different characteristics at different positions; and (4) cell movement, which rearranges the cells to form structured tissues and organs (Figure 21\u20131). It is on the fourth point that plant development differs radically: plant cells are unable to migrate or move independently through the embryo because each one is contained within a cell wall, through which it is cemented to its neighbors, as discussed in Chapter 19."

It works by stimulating the ubiquitylation and degradation of repressor proteins that block the transcription of auxin target genes in unstimulated cells (Figure 15\u201371B and C).

            "content": "The ability to produce transgenic plants has greatly accelerated progress in many areas of plant cell biology. It has played an important part, for example, in isolating receptors for growth regulators and in analyzing the mechanisms of morphogenesis and of gene expression in plants. These techniques have also opened up many new possibilities in agriculture that could benefit both the farmer and the consumer. They have made it possible, for example, to modify the ratio of lipid, starch, and protein in seeds, to impart pest and virus resistance to plants, and to create modified plants that tolerate extreme habitats such as salt marshes or water-stressed soil. One variety of rice has been genetically engineered to produce \u03b2-carotene, the precursor of vitamin A. Were it to replace conventional rice, this \u201cgolden rice\u201d\u2014so-called because of its faint yellow color\u2014could help to alleviate severe vitamin A deficiency, which causes blindness in hundreds of thousands of children in the"

(B) Light microscopy of a plant leaf cell\u2014here, a mesophyll cell from Zinnia elegans\u2014shows chloroplasts as bright green bodies, measuring several micrometers across, in the transparent cell interior. (C) the electron micrograph of a thin, stained section through a wheat leaf cell shows a thin rim of cytoplasm\u2014 containing chloroplasts, the nucleus, and mitochondria\u2014surrounding a large, water-filled vacuole. (D) at higher magnification, electron microscopy reveals the chloroplast envelope membrane and the thylakoid membrane within the chloroplast that is highly folded into grana stacks (Movie 14.9).

            "content": "In plants, the cell wall between a typical pair of adjacent cells is at least 0.1 \u03bcm thick, and so a structure very different from a gap junction is required to mediate communication across it. Plasmodesmata solve the problem. With a few specialized exceptions, every living cell in a higher plant is connected to its living neighbors by these structures, which form fine cytoplasmic channels through the intervening cell walls. As shown in Figure 19\u201327A, the plasma membrane of one cell is continuous with that of its neighbor at each plasmodesma, which connects the cytoplasms of the two cells by a roughly cylindrical channel with a diameter of 20\u201340 nm."
