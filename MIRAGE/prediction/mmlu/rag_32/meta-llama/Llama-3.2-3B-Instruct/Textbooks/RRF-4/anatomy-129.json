Swallowing is a complex process that involves the coordination of multiple muscles and neural pathways. The question asks what happens during swallowing. Based on the provided documents, we can identify the key events and muscles involved in swallowing. The pharyngeal phase of swallowing involves the elevation of the larynx, closure of the epiglottis, and contraction of the cricopharyngeus muscle. The cricopharyngeus muscle is responsible for preventing the entry of food into the trachea during swallowing. Therefore, during swallowing, the cricopharyngeus muscle contracts to prevent food from entering the airway.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" } ``` The final answer is B.

This is followed by a transfer phase during which the bolus is pushed into the pharynx by the tongue. Bolus entry into the hypopharynx initiates the pharyngeal swallow response, which is centrally mediated and involves a complex series of actions, the net result of which is to propel food through the pharynx into the esophagus while preventing its entry into the airway. To accomplish this, the larynx is elevated and pulled forward, actions that also facilitate upper esophageal sphincter (UES) opening. Tongue pulsion then propels the bolus through the UES, followed by a peristaltic contraction that clears residue from the pharynx and through the esophagus. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxes as the food enters the esophagus and remains relaxed until the peristaltic contraction has delivered the bolus into the stomach. Peristaltic contractions"

Because the oropharynx is a shared conduit for breathing and swallowing, obligatory reflexes exist to ensure that breathing is held in abeyance during swallowing. Because of this relationship and the frequency with which dysphagia and aspiration complicate neurologic disease, the neural mechanisms that underlie swallowing are of considerable importance to the neurologist and are described here. The reader is also referred to other parts of this book for a discussion of derangements of swallowing consequent upon diseases of the lower cranial nerves (see Chap. 44), of muscle (see Chap. 45), and of the neuromuscular junction (see Chap. 46)."

The movement of the bolus by the tongue, the timing of reflex swallowing, and the closure of the pharyngeal and palatal openings are judged directly by observation of a bolus of food mixed with barium or of liquid barium alone. However, authorities in the field, such as Wiles, whose reviews are recommended (see also Hughes and Wiles), warn that unqualified dependence on videofluoroscopy is unwise. They remark that observation of the patient swallowing water and repeated observation of the patient while eating can be equally informative. Having the patient swallow water is a particularly effective test of laryngeal closure; the presence of coughing, wet hoarseness or breathlessness, and the need to swallow small volumes slowly are indicative of a high risk of aspiration."

Concomitantly with the posterior movement of the tongue, the soft palate is elevated, thereby closing the passage between the oropharynx and nasopharynx.

            "content": "Because of its frequency, the neurologist will encounter stroke in a cerebral hemisphere as a cause of discoordinated swallowing. The problem is most evident during the first few days after a hemispheral stroke on either side of the brain (Meadows). These effects last days or weeks and render the patient subject to pneumonia and fever. In the clinical and fluoroscopic study by Mann and colleagues, half of patients still had manifest abnormalities of swallowing 6 months after their strokes. For this reason, it has become customary for patients to have swallowing evaluations in the days after acute stroke. Some insight into the nature of swallowing dysfunction after stroke is provided by Hamdy and colleagues, who correlated the presence of dysphagia with a lesser degree of motor representation of pharyngeal muscles in the unaffected hemisphere, as assessed by magnetic stimulation of the cortex."

            "content": "The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxes as the food enters the esophagus and remains relaxed until the peristaltic contraction has delivered the bolus into the stomach. Peristaltic contractions elicited in response to a swallow are called primary peristalsis and involve sequenced inhibition followed by contraction of the musculature along the entire length of the esophagus. The inhibition that precedes the peristaltic contraction is called deglutitive inhibition. Local distention of the esophagus anywhere along its length, as may occur with gastroesophageal reflux, activates secondary peristalsis that begins at the point of distention and proceeds distally. Tertiary esophageal contractions are nonperistaltic, disordered esophageal contractions that may be observed to occur spontaneously during fluoroscopic observation."
