Rabbit ATG is a purified gamma globulin obtained by immunizing rabbits with human thymocytes, which contains antibodies to T cells and B lymphocytes (B cells), integrins, and other adhesion molecules. This treatment is used to suppress the immune system in patients with bone marrow failure or organ transplantation. The symptoms presented by the patient, such as fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and erythema on her hands and feet, are indicative of a hypersensitivity reaction. The most likely cause of these symptoms is immune complex deposition in tissues, as the rabbit ATG contains antibodies that can react with human antigens, leading to the formation of immune complexes. These immune complexes can deposit in tissues, triggering an inflammatory response and the symptoms observed in the patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Children do especially well, whereas older adult patients often suffer complications due to the presence of comorbidities. An early robust hematologic response correlates with long-term survival. Improvement in granulocyte number is generally apparent within 2 months of treatment. Most recovered patients continue to have some degree of blood count depression, the MCV remains elevated, and bone marrow cellularity returns toward normal very slowly if at all. Relapse (recurrent pancytopenia) is frequent, often occurring as cyclosporine is discontinued; most, but not all, patients respond to reinstitution of immunosuppression, but some responders become dependent on continued cyclosporine administration.

Laboratory data support an important role for the immune system in aplastic anemia. Blood and bone marrow cells of patients can suppress normal hematopoietic progenitor cell growth, and removal of T cells from aplastic anemia bone marrow improves colony formation in vitro.

            "content": "Drugs (Table 130-3) Many chemotherapeutic drugs have marrow suppression as a major toxicity; effects are dose dependent and will occur in all recipients. In contrast, idiosyncratic reactions to a large and diverse group of drugs may lead to aplastic anemia without a clear dose-response relationship. These associations rest largely on accumulated case reports until a large international study in Europe in the 1980s quantitated drug relationships, especially for nonsteroidal analgesics, sulfonamides, thyrostatic drugs, some psychotropics, penicillamine, allopurinol, and gold. Association does not equal causation: a drug may have been used to treat the first symptoms of bone marrow failure (antibiotics for fever or the preceding viral illness) or provoked the first symptom of a preexisting disease (petechiae by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents administered to the thrombocytopenic patient). In the context of total drug use, idiosyncratic reactions, although individually devastating,"

            "content": "Monoclonal cryoglobulinemia is associated with plasma cell dyscrasias, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and lymphoma. Purpura, primarily of the lower extremities, and hemorrhagic infarcts of the fingers, toes, and ears are seen in these patients. Exacerbations of disease activity can follow cold exposure or an increase in serum viscosity. Biopsy specimens show precipitates of the cryoglobulin within dermal vessels. Similar deposits have been found in the lung, brain, and renal glomeruli. Patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura can also have hemorrhagic infarcts as a result of intravascular thromboses. Additional signs include microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and fluctuating neurologic abnormalities, especially headaches and confusion."

Neonatal death (previous or current) and lower infant birth weight are three times more likely among women seropositive for C. burnetii. After the usual incubation period of 3\u201330 days, 1070 patients with acute Q fever in southern France presented with hepatitis (40%), both pneumonia and hepatitis (20%), pneumonia (17%), isolated fever (14%), CNS involvement (2%), and pericarditis or myocarditis (1%). Acalculous cholecystitis, pancreatitis, lymphadenopathy, spontaneous rupture of the spleen, transient hypoplastic anemia, bone marrow necrosis, hemolytic anemia, histiocytic hemophagocytosis, optic neuritis, and erythema nodosum were less common manifestations."
