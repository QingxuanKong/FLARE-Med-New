    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options given in the context of the provided documents. First, we need to identify what is meant by \"intracellular messengers.\" According to Document [0], intracellular signaling molecules are often referred to as \"second messengers.\" These molecules are generated in response to extracellular signals and diffuse throughout the cell to activate specific proteins and modulate cellular function. Now, let's examine each option: A. Calcium ions (Ca++) are mentioned in Document [0] as a small molecule that acts as a second messenger in intracellular signaling pathways. B. cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is also mentioned in Document [0] as a small molecule that acts as a second messenger in intracellular signaling pathways. C. Acetylcholine is mentioned in Document [31] as a neurotransmitter that acts on ionotropic receptors, which are ion channels, not as a second messenger. D. Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) is mentioned in Document [0] as a small molecule that acts as a second messenger in intracellular signaling pathways. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which option does NOT serve as an intracellular messenger. Acetylcholine is the only option that does not fit this description, as it is a neurotransmitter that acts on ionotropic receptors, not as a second messenger.

Signaling pathways often include dozens of small molecules that form complicated networks within the cell (Fig. 3.7 ). Some proteins in the intracellular signaling pathways relay the signal by passing the message directly to another protein (e.g., by phosphorylating a target, or by binding and causing an allosteric change). Such intracellular signaling proteins act as reversible molecular switches: When a signal is received, they switch from an inactive to an active form or vice versa, until another signaling molecule reverses the process. This principle of reversibility is central to many signaling pathways. In many cases, activation is achieved by reversing inhibition: For example, the thyroid hormone receptor is bound to an inhibitory protein in the absence of signal."

The enzymatic production of second messengers also serves the dual purpose of achieving concentrations of them sufficient to activate the next stage of the pathway and of amplifying the signaling cascade. The second messengers generated by receptors that signal via tyrosine kinases include calcium ions (Ca2+) and a variety of membrane lipids and their soluble derivatives. Although some of these lipid messengers are confined to membranes, they can move within them.

Many intracellular proteins have short half-lives, some surviving for less than 10 minutes. In most cases, these are key regulatory proteins whose concentrations are rapidly controlled in the cell by changes in their rates of synthesis. As we have seen, many cell responses to extracellular signals depend on the conversion of intracellular signaling proteins from an inactive to an active form, rather than on their synthesis or degradation. Phosphorylation or the binding of GTP, for example, commonly activates signaling proteins. Even in these cases, however, the activation must be rapidly and continuously reversed (by dephosphorylation or GTP hydrolysis to GDP, respectively, in these examples) to make rapid signaling possible. These inactivation processes play a crucial part in determining the magnitude, rapidity, and duration of the response."

A similar sharpening of response is seen when the activation of an intracellular signaling protein requires phosphorylation at more than one site. Such responses become sharper as the number of required molecules or phosphate groups increases, and if the number is large enough, responses become almost all-or-none (Figure 15\u201316)."

            "content": "Any such amplifying cascade of stimulatory signals requires counterbalancing mechanisms at every step of the cascade to restore the system to its resting state when stimulation ceases. As emphasized earlier, the response to stimulation can be rapid only if the inactivating mechanisms are also rapid. Cells therefore have efficient mechanisms for rapidly degrading (and resynthesizing) cyclic nucleotides and for buffering and removing cytosolic Ca2+, as well as for inactivating the responding enzymes and ion channels once they have been activated. This is not only essential for turning a response off, but is also important for defining the resting state from which a response begins. Each protein in the signaling relay chain can be a separate target for regulation, including the receptor itself, as we discuss next."

            "content": "However, not all chemical signaling in the nervous system operates through these ionotropic ligand-gated ion channels. In fact, most neurotransmitter molecules that are secreted by nerve terminals, including a large variety of neuropeptides, bind to metabotropic receptors, which regulate ion channels only indirectly through the action of small intracellular signal molecules (discussed in Chapter 15). All neurotransmitter receptors fall into one or other of these two major classes\u2014ionotropic or metabotropic\u2014on the basis of their signaling mechanisms: 1. Ionotropic receptors are ion channels and feature at fast chemical synapses. Acetylcholine, glycine, glutamate, and GABA all act on transmitter-gated ion channels, mediating excitatory or inhibitory signaling that is generally immediate, simple, and brief. 2."
