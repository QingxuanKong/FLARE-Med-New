            "content": "Enzymes achieve extremely high rates of chemical reaction\u2014rates that are far higher than for any synthetic catalysts. There are several reasons for this efficiency. First, when two molecules need to react, the enzyme greatly increases the local concentration of both of these substrate molecules at the catalytic site, holding them in the correct orientation for the reaction that is to follow. More importantly, however, some of the binding energy contributes directly to the catalysis. Substrate molecules must pass through a series of intermediate states of altered geometry and electron distribution before they form the ultimate products of the reaction. The free energy required to attain the most unstable intermediate state, called the transition state, is known as the activation energy for the reaction, and it is the major determinant of the reaction rate. Enzymes have a much higher affinity for the transition state of the substrate than they have for the stable form."

Instead, they are organized into multistep sequences called pathways, such as that of glycolysis (Fig. 8.1). In a pathway, the product of one reaction serves as the substrate of the subsequent reaction. Most pathways can be classified as either catabolic (degradative) or anabolic (synthetic). Catabolic pathways break down complex molecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids, to a few simple molecules (for example, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and water). Anabolic pathways form complex end products from simple precursors, for example, the synthesis of the polysaccharide glycogen from glucose.

The active site binds the substrate, forming an enzyme\u2013substrate (ES) complex. Binding is thought to cause a conformational change in the enzyme (induced fit) that allows catalysis. ES is converted to enzyme and product. An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (Ea).

Peptide bonds, for example, can be hydrolyzed in the absence of an enzyme by exposing a polypeptide to either a strong acid or a strong base. Enzymes are unique, however, in being able to use acid and base catalysis simultaneously, because the rigid framework of the protein constrains the acidic and basic residues and prevents them from combining with each other, as they would do in solution (Figure 3\u201349)."

            "content": "The Cell Regulates the Catalytic Activities of Its Enzymes A living cell contains thousands of enzymes, many of which operate at the same time and in the same small volume of the cytosol. By their catalytic action, these enzymes generate a complex web of metabolic pathways, each composed of chains of chemical reactions in which the product of one enzyme becomes the substrate of the next. In this maze of pathways, there are many branch points (nodes) where different enzymes compete for the same substrate. The system is complex (see Figure 2\u201363), and elaborate controls are required to regulate when and how rapidly each reaction occurs."

            "content": "rate of reaction Figure 3\u201346 enzyme kinetics. The rate of an enzyme reaction (V) increases as the substrate concentration increases until a maximum value (Vmax) is reached. At this point all substrate-binding sites on the enzyme molecules are fully occupied, and the rate of reaction is limited by the rate of the catalytic process on the enzyme surface. For most enzymes, the concentration of substrate at which the reaction rate is half-maximal (Km) is a measure of how tightly the substrate is bound, with a large value of Km corresponding to weak binding."

            "content": "Why is the mutation rate so much higher in mitochondria than in the nucleus (and chloroplasts)? Could this high rate have been useful to the cell? What mechanisms and pathways have been used during evolution to transfer genes from the mitochondrion to the nucleus? how many seconds would it take the heart to consume an amount of ATP equal to its steady-state levels? (Complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose to CO2 yields 30 ATP, 26 of which are derived by oxidative phosphorylation using the 12 pairs of electrons captured in the electron carriers NADH and FADH2.) 14\u20136 Both H+ and Ca2+ are ions that move through the cytosol. Why is the movement of H+ ions so much faster than that of Ca2+ ions? How do you suppose the speed of these two ions would be affected by freezing the solution? Would you expect them to move faster or slower? Explain your answer."

            "content": "An enzyme cannot change the equilibrium point for a reaction. The reason is simple: when an enzyme (or any catalyst) lowers the activation energy for the reaction Y \u2192 X, of necessity it also lowers the activation energy for the reaction X \u2192 Y by exactly the same amount (see Figure 2\u201321). The forward and backward reactions will therefore be accelerated by the same factor by an enzyme, and the equilibrium point for the reaction will be unchanged (Figure 2\u201323). Thus no matter how much an enzyme speeds up a reaction, it cannot change its direction."
