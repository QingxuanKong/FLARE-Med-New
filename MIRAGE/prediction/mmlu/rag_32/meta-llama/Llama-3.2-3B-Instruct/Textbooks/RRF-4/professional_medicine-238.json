    "question": "A 32-year-old man who is a jackhammer operator comes to the physician because of pain and swelling of his right arm for 3 days. The symptoms are moderately exacerbated by exertion. Examination of the right upper extremity shows erythema and moderate edema. Capillary refill time is less than 3 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "D": "Superior vena cava syndrome"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a jackhammer operator, which is a high-risk occupation for vascular injuries, and the symptoms of pain and swelling in the right arm, exacerbated by exertion, are suggestive of a vascular issue. The examination findings of erythema and moderate edema, as well as a capillary refill time of less than 3 seconds, indicate inflammation and potential clotting or obstruction of a vein. The patient's occupation and symptoms point towards a vascular injury or condition affecting the veins, such as a thrombophlebitis or venous obstruction. The options can be evaluated as follows: A. Axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis is a possible cause, but the symptoms and examination findings do not specifically suggest a deep vein. B. Deep venous valvular insufficiency would typically present with symptoms of swelling and discomfort in the legs, which is not the case here. C. Superficial thrombophlebitis of the basilic vein is a common condition in individuals who work with vibrating tools, such as jackhammer operators, and is characterized by inflammation of the superficial veins, which matches the patient's symptoms and occupation. D. Superior vena cava syndrome is a serious condition that affects the superior vena cava, which is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and occupation. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is C. Superficial thrombophlebitis of the basilic vein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Dyspnea is the most common presenting symptom, but this complaint is far from specific for the diagnosis of PH. PH symptoms are insidious and overlap considerably with many common conditions, including asthma and other lung disease and cardiac disease. The symptoms of PH are often nonspecific and variable. Most patients will present with dyspnea and/or fatigue, whereas edema, chest pain, presyncope, and frank syncope are less common and associated with more advanced disease. On examination, there may be evidence of right ventricular failure with elevated jugular venous pressure, lower extremity edema, and ascites. Additionally, the cardiovascular examination may reveal an accentuated P2 component of the second heart sound, a right-sided S3 or S4, and a holosystolic tricuspid regurgitant murmur.

However, patients with a high clinical likelihood of VTE should skip d-dimer testing and undergo imaging as the next step in the diagnostic algorithm. Clinical Pearls Not all leg pain is due to DVT, and not all dyspnea is due to PE (Table 300-2). Sudden, severe calf discomfort suggests a ruptured Baker\u2019s cyst. Fever and chills usually herald cellulitis rather than DVT. Physical findings, if present, may consist only of mild palpation discomfort in the lower calf. However, massive DVT often presents with marked thigh swelling, tenderness, and erythema. If the leg is diffusely edematous, DVT is unlikely. More probable is an acute exacerbation of venous insufficiency due to postthrombotic syndrome. Upper extremity venous thrombosis may present with asymmetry in the supraclavicular fossa or in the circumference of the upper arms."

With more severe disease, hair loss, thickened nails, smooth and shiny skin, reduced skin temperature, and pallor or cyanosis are common physical signs. In patients with critical limb ischemia, ulcers or gangrene may occur. Elevation of the legs and repeated flexing of the calf muscles produce pallor of the soles of the feet, whereas rubor, secondary to reactive hyperemia, may develop when the legs are dependent. The time required for rubor to develop or for the veins in the foot to fill when the patient\u2019s legs are transferred from an elevated to a dependent position is related to the severity of the ischemia and the presence of collateral vessels. Patients with severe ischemia may develop peripheral edema because they keep their legs in a dependent position much of the time. Ischemic neuropathy can result in numbness"

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

The chronic stages of the disease, which is intermittently active, present with symptoms related to large artery occlusion, such as upper extremity claudication, cerebral ischemia, and syncope. The process is progressive, and there is no definitive therapy. Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents are effective in some patients during the acute phase. Surgical bypass or endovascular intervention of a critically stenotic artery may be necessary."

            "content": "Over the following week the paralysis improved and was likely due to nerve bruising during the procedure. The patient remained asymptomatic. A 60-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department with acute right-sided weakness, predominantly in the upper limb, which lasted for 24 hours. She made an uneventful recovery, but was extremely concerned about the nature of her illness and went to see her local doctor. A diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) was made. A TIA is a neurological deficit resolving within 24 hours. It is a type of stroke. Neurological deficits may be permanent or transient. Most transient events resolve within 21 days; any failure of resolution beyond 21 days is an established stroke. An investigation into the cause of the TIA was undertaken. Eighty-five percent of all strokes result from cerebral infarction, of which most are due to embolization. A duplex Doppler scan of the carotid vessels was performed."

Focused History: This was IR\u2019s first occurrence of severe joint pain. In the ED, he was given an anti-inflammatory medication. Fluid aspirated from the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb was negative for organisms but positive for needle-shaped monosodium urate (MSU) crystals (see image at right). The inflammatory symptoms have since resolved. IR reports he is in good health otherwise, with no significant past medical history. His body mass index (BMI) is 31. No tophi (deposits of MSU crystals under the skin) were detected in the physical examination."

The examining physician discovers postural hypotension and moderate vitiligo (depigmented areas of skin) and obtains routine blood tests. She finds hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis and suspects Addison\u2019s disease. She performs a standard ACTH 1\u201324 stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response compatible with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency. The diagnosis of autoimmune Addison\u2019s disease is made, and the patient must start replacement of the hormones he cannot produce himself. How should this patient be treated? What precautions should he take?"

With disease progression, angina, exertional near-syncope, and symptoms and signs of right-sided heart failure appear. Physical examination may show tachypnea, a prominent split S2heartsound,palpablerightventricularheave,elevatedjugularvenous pressure, and dependent edema. Doppler echocardiography provides a noninvasive method for estimating the pulmonary arterial pressure. In light of the poor prognosis of untreated PAH, all SSc patients should be screened for its presence at initial evaluation. Echocardiographic estimates of pulmonary arterial systolic pressures >40 mmHg at rest suggest PAH. Pulmonary function testing may show a reduced DLcoin isolation or out of proportion with the severity of restriction. Right heart catheterization is the gold standard for diagnosing PAH. Because echocardiography can result in over-or underestimation of pulmonary arterial pressures in SSc, cardiac"

Cyanosis may be intensified by exposure to a cold environment. Acrocyanosis may be categorized as primary or secondary to an underlying condition. In primary acrocyanosis, women are affected much more frequently than men, and the age of onset is usually <30 years. Generally, patients are asymptomatic but seek medical attention because of the discoloration. The prognosis is favorable, and pain, ulcers, and gangrene do not occur. Examination reveals normal pulses, peripheral cyanosis, and moist palms (Fig. 302-3B). Trophic skin changes and ulcerations do not occur. The disorder can be distinguished from Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon because it is persistent and not episodic, the discoloration extends proximally from the digits, and blanching does not occur. Ischemia secondary to arterial occlusive disease can"
