A history of snoring is typical; some children may have excessive daytime sleepiness. Obese children are at increased risk for OSA. In toddlers OSA often is associated with poor growth, which improves when the obstruction is relieved by a tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy. Many children with OSA experience cognitive difficulties and school problems. Hyperactivity is also more common in these children than in age-matched controls. Primary sleep disorders must be differentiated from sleep disorders associated with psychiatric and medical disorders. Psychoses, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse can present with disordered sleep. The clinician should also consider sleep-related epilepsy and developmental disorders.

The measured score from a PSG is the apnea-hypopnea index(AHI) or number of times in an hour of sleep that the child has cessation or reduction of airflow of a significant magnitude to negatively affect ventilation or sleep stage. An AHI less than 1 is the generally accepted norm for pediatric patients, although the decision to treat often hinges on the severity of daytime impairment.

Weight gain may precipitate an increase in symptoms. Although obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea can occur at any age, it most commonly manifests among individuals ages 40\u201460 years. Over 4\u20145 years, the average apnea hypopnea index increases in adults and older individuals by ap\u2014 proximately two apneas/hypopneas per hour. The apnea hypopnea index is increased and in- cident obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is greater among individuals who are older, who are male, or who have a higher baseline body mass index (BMI) or increase their BMI over time."

            "content": "Respiratory dysfunction during sleep is a common, serious cause of excessive daytime sleepiness as well as of disturbed nocturnal sleep. At least 24% of middle-aged men and 9% of middle-aged women in the United States have a reduction or cessation of breathing dozens or more times each night during sleep, with 9% of men and 4% of women doing so more than a hundred times per night. These episodes may be due to an occlusion of the airway (obstructive sleep apnea), absence of respiratory effort (central sleep apnea), or a combination of these factors (mixed sleep apnea). Failure to recognize and treat these conditions appropriately may lead to impairment of daytime alertness, increased risk of sleep-related motor vehicle crashes, depression, hypertension, myocardial infarction, diabetes, stroke, and increased mortality. Sleep apnea is particularly prevalent in overweight men and in the elderly, yet it is estimated to go undiagnosed in most affected individuals. This is unfortunate"

            "content": "The assessment of sleep complaints begins with a detailed history of sleep habits, including bedtime, sleep-onset, and wake times. A detailed description of the sleep environment can result in a dynamic understanding of the challenges to and resources for achieving normal sleep. The recommended history includes the type of bed, who shares it, the ambient light, noise, temperature, and the bedtime routine. Household structure, routines, and cultural practices may be important and influence the timing and ease of sleep (e.g., parental work patterns, evening activities, number of household members). Dietary practices influence sleep, including timing of meals and caffeine intake. A detailed history assessing for symptoms of OSA (gasps, snorting noises, breathing pauses, and so on) should be obtained in all children who snore regularly. New-onset sleep disorders may be associated with a psychological trauma. When the history does not reveal the cause of the sleep disorder, a sleep diary"

In children, most cases are due to tonsillar/adenoidal hypertrophy, which is corrected surgically. CSA: Mechanical ventilation (e.g., BPAP) with a backup rate for severe cases. A spectrum of disorders characterized by a misalignment between desired and actual sleep periods. Subtypes include jet-lag type, shift-work type, delayed sleep-phase type, and unspecif ed. Tx: Jet-lag type usually resolves within 2\u20137 days without specific treatment. Shift-work type may respond to light therapy. Oral melatonin may be useful if given 5\u00bd hours prior to the desired bedtime. Patients often present with medically unexplained somatic symptoms, generally with varying etiologies. Somatoform disorders: Patients have no conscious control over symptoms. The fve main categories are outlined in Table 2.14-14."
