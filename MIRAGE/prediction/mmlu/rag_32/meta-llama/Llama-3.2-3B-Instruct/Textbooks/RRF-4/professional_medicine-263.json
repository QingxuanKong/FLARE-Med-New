    "question": "A 15-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother because he has been tired and irritable for the past 3 months. He is a high school freshman and a member of the track team. He reports that his symptoms began shortly after starting spring training. He practices sprints 5 nights a week and runs 2 to 5 miles several days a week in addition to leg training with weights. He admits to being tired and says the training is becoming more intense and that he is a little concerned about his ability to continue on the team. His appetite has been unchanged. Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no medications. He has been your patient for the past 3 years. He seems more sullen than you remember from previous visits. You ask his mother to leave the examining room while you complete the physical examination. After she leaves the room, he admits that he is worried about some lumps in his groin. It is most appropriate to obtain additional history regarding which of the following?",

The patient is a 15-year-old high school freshman who has been experiencing fatigue and irritability for the past 3 months. He has been increasing his physical activity, specifically sprinting and weight training, which may be contributing to his symptoms. He also mentions being worried about lumps in his groin, which could be related to testicular enlargement or another condition. Given the patient's age and sex, it is essential to consider potential testicular issues. The question asks which additional history to obtain, and the correct answer is related to sexual activity, as it can help determine if the lumps are testicular in nature. The other options, fever and chills, mood symptoms, and school performance, are not directly related to the symptoms described in the groin area.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

Also, the degree of customary physical activity at work and during recreation should be considered. The development of two-flight dyspnea in a well-conditioned marathon runner may be far more significant than the development of one-flight dyspnea in a previously sedentary person.

What jobs have you held? These must be corroborated by a spouse or other family member. We also find it useful to quiz the patient about cultural icons of the past that are appropriate to his age. Most patients should be able to name the recent presidents in reverse order. b. Recent past: Tell me about your recent illness (compare with previous statements). What is my name (or the nurse\u2019s name)? When did you see me for the first time? What tests were done yesterday? What were the headlines of the newspaper today?"

He has been generally healthy, is sedentary, drinks several cocktails per day, and does not smoke cigarettes. He has a family history of hypertension, and his father died of a myocardial infarction at age 55. Physical examination is remarkable only for moderate obesity.

A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."

            "content": "CliniCal and laboratory findings Usually, symptoms first develop in adulthood and involve exercise intolerance with muscle cramps. Two types of activity tend to cause symptoms: (1) brief exercise of great intensity, such as sprinting or carrying heavy loads; and (2) less intense but sustained activity, such as climbing stairs or walking uphill. Most patients can engage in moderate exercise, such as walking on level ground, for long periods. Patients often exhibit the \u201csecond-wind\u201d phenomenon, in which, after a short break from the initiation of strenuous physical effort, they are able to continue the activity without pain. Although most patients experience episodic muscle pain and cramping as a result of exercise, 35% report permanent pain that seriously affects sleep and other activities. About half of patients report burgundy-colored urine after exercise; this coloration results from myoglobinuria secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Intense myoglobinuria after vigorous exercise can lead to"

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

They are initiated by autophosphorylation of select tyrosine residues in their receptors. C. They are mediated by binding to adrenergic receptors, which are a class of nuclear receptors. D. They result in the activation of glycogen and triacylglycerol synthesis. Q3. NE bound to certain receptors causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. Why might NE be used clinically in the treatment of septic shock?

Focused History: AZ\u2019s father reports that the boy has always been quite sensitive to the sun. His skin turns red (erythema) and his eyes hurt (photophobia) if he is exposed to the sun for any period of time."
