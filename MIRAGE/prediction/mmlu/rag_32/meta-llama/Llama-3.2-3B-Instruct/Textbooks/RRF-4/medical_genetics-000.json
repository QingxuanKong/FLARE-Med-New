Robertsonian translocations involve the fusion of the long arms of two acrocentric chromosomes, which are chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22. The key characteristic of acrocentric chromosomes is that they have extremely short p arms, with the majority of their genetic material located on the long arm (q arm). The fusion occurs at the centromere, which is the region near the center of the chromosome where the sister chromatids are attached. This region is also known as the centromere. The centromere is the point where the short arms of the chromosomes attach to the long arms. Given this information, we can determine that the correct answer is the centromeres.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

These recurrent translocations include t(11;22), which results in Emanuel syndrome in the unbalanced form, and several translocations involving a region on 4p, 8p, and 12p. These recurrent translocations occur in regions of the genome that contain specific types of AT-rich repeats, or other repeat sequences, that are prone to rearrangement. A special category of translocations is the Robertsonian translocations, which involve the acrocentric chromosomes. An acrocentric chromosome has unique genetic material only on the long arm of the chromosomes, whereas the short arm contains repetitive DNA. The acrocentric chromosomes are 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22.

However, during gametogenesis, abnormal (unbalanced) gametes are formed, resulting in abnormal zygotes. A special pattern of translocation involving two acrocentric chromosomes is called centric fusion type, or robertsonian, translocation. The breaks typically occur close to the centromere, affecting the short arms of both chromosomes. Transfer of the segments leads to one very large chromosome and one extremely small one ( Fig. 7.14 ). The short fragments are lost, and the carrier has 45 chromosomes. Because the short arms of all acrocentric chromosomes carry highly redundant genes (e.g., ribosomal RNA genes), such loss is compatible with survival. However, difficulties arise during gametogenesis, resulting in the formation of unbalanced gametes that could lead to abnormal offspring."

            "content": "Approximately 80 percent of pregnancies with Patau syndrome result from trisomy 13. The remainder is caused by a robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 13. The most frequent structural chromosomal rearrangement is a translocation between chromosomes 13 and 14, der(l3; 14) (q 1 O;q 10). This translocation is carried by approximately 1 in 1300 individuals, although the risk of an afected liveborn neonate is less than 2 percent (Nussbaum, 2007). FIGURE 13-5 Trisomy 18-Edwards Syndrome. A. This transventricular sonographic view shows fetal choroid plexus cysts and an angulated \"strawberry-shaped\" skull. B. Radial clubhand is manifested as a single forearm bone (radius), with the hands in a fixed, hyperflexed position at right angles to the forearms. C. This three-dimensional (3-\ufffd) sonographic image shows the characteristic hand position of clenched fists with overlapping digits. D. 3-D sonographic image displays a rockerbottom foot."

PAX3 is a transcription factor that initiates skeletal muscle differentiation, and it appears that the chimeric PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein interferes with differentiation, a mechanism similar to many of the transcription factor fusion proteins that are found in acute leukemias.
