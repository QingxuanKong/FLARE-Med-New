    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the characteristics of phlebitis and the options provided. Phlebitis is inflammation of a vein, typically caused by infection or injury. Common signs of phlebitis include redness, swelling, warmth, and tenderness at the affected site, as well as the presence of exudate (a yellowish or greenish fluid that accumulates in the vein). Swelling and redness are signs of inflammation, while exudate is a direct indication of infection. Coolness to the touch is not typically associated with phlebitis, as the affected area is usually warm due to inflammation. Given these characteristics, let's evaluate the options: A. Swelling - This is a common sign of phlebitis due to fluid accumulation and inflammation. B. Redness - This is also a common sign of phlebitis, indicating inflammation and infection. C. Exudate - The presence of exudate is a direct indicator of phlebitis, often due to infection. D. Cool to the touch - This is not a typical sign of phlebitis, as the affected area is usually warm due to inflammation. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Cool to the touch.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Phlebitis can occur even with close surveillance of the intravenous site. In one study, more than 50% of the cases of phlebitis became evident more than 12 hours after discontinuation of intravenous catheters (96). Less than one-third of patients had symptoms related to the intravenous catheter site 24 hours before the diagnosis of phlebitis. Phlebitis can be diagnosed based on the presence of fever, pain, redness, induration, or a palpable venous cord. Occasionally, suppuration will be present. Phlebitis is usually self-limited and resolves within 3 to 4 days. The treatment includes application of warm, moist compresses and prompt removal of any catheters from the infected vein. Antibiotic therapy with antistaphylococcal agents should be instituted for catheter-related sepsis. Excision or drainage of an infected vein rarely is necessary."

However, with the advent of antimicrobial therapy, the mortality rate and need for surgical therapy for these infections diminished. Septic phlebitis arises as an extension along venous routes and may cause thrombosis as shown in Figure 37-6. Lymphangitis often coexists. he ovarian veins may then become involved because they drain the upper uterus and therefore the placental implantation site. The experiences of Witlin and Sibai (1995) and Brown and coworkers (1999) suggest that puerperal septic thrombophlebitis is likely to involve one or both ovarian venous plexuses. In a fourth of women, the clot extends into the inferior vena cava and occasionally to the renal vein. The incidence of septic phlebitis has varied in several reports."

Because the incidence of catheter-related phlebitis increases significantly after 72 hours, intravenous catheters should be changed at least every 3 days according to the CDC (94). The institution of intravenous therapy teams decreased the incidence of phlebitis by as much as 50% in one study (95). In combination, these measures led to a dramatic decrease in peripheral catheter site infection."

If the thrombophlebitis remains confined to the transverse sinus, there are no other neurologic signs. Spread to the jugular bulb may give rise to the syndrome of the jugular foramen (see Table 44-1) and involvement of the torcula, leading to increased intracranial pressure. One lateral sinus, usually the right, is normally larger than the other, which may account for greatly elevated pressure when it is occluded. However, contiguous involvement of the superior sagittal sinus and cortical veins emanating from it causes seizures and focal cerebral signs (see in the following text)."

All errors and omissions will gladly be corrected if brought to the attention of the authors through the publisher. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2006, 3rd ed., 546 pages, ISBN 9781405105095 A concise book presented in outline format, packed with key information across the various fields of medicine. Pros: Very high yield. Makes nice use of tables and charts. Good for quick study and last-minute review. Useful on the wards as well, and fits in a pocket. Cons: Small print. Not tremendously detailed, but covers many topics. More in-depth books are required for further explanation. Summary: A good, comprehensive review, but lacks some detail."

HbA, a tetramer of 2 \u03b1 and 2 \u03b2 globin chains, delivers O2 from the lungs to the tissues and protons and CO2 from the tissues to the lungs. Increased concentration of which of the following will result in decreased O2 delivery by HbA? A. 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate B. Carbon dioxide C. Carbon monoxide D. Protons Q3. What is the basis for the increase in HbA2 and HbF (fetal Hb) in the \u03b2thalassemias? Q4. Why is the allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization technique useful in the diagnosis of all cases of sickle cell anemia but not all cases of \u03b2-thalassemia?
