The ACTH-dependent causes can result from ACTH secreted by pituitary adenomas or from an ectopic source. The hallmark of ACTH-dependent forms of Cushing syndrome is the presence of normal or high plasma ACTH concentrations with increased cortisol levels. The adrenal glands are hyperplastic bilaterally. Pituitary ACTH-secreting adenoma, or Cushing disease, is the most common cause of endogenous Cushing syndrome (154). These pituitary adenomas are usually microadenomas (<10 mm in diameter) that may be as small as 1 mm.

However, it should be emphasized that iatrogenic hypercortisolism is the most common cause of cushingoid features. Ectopic tumor ACTH production, cortisol-producing adrenal adenomas, adrenal carcinoma, and adrenal hyperplasia account for the other causes; rarely, ectopic tumor CRH production is encountered."

            "content": "In Cushing disease, either hyperplasia of pituitary cells or a basophil or chromophobe adenoma produces excessive ACTH, which stimulates the adrenals. Corticotroph (basophil) adenomas are usually microadenomas (<1 cm) and enlarge the sella in only 20 percent of cases. However, it is now appreciated by MRI or high-resolution CT through the sella, that either microor macroadenomas are the cause in approximately 80 percent of cases of Cushing syndrome, higher than in the aforementioned series by Orth. There are only a few cases in which a hypothalamic tumor such as a gangliocytoma has caused Cushing syndrome."

            "content": "disease refers to a pituitary tumor, usually an adenoma, which leads to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and hypercortisolism. Cushing\u2019s syndrome (endogenous) is a rare disease, affecting 10 in 1 mil-lion individuals. It is more common in adults but may occur in children. Women are more commonly affected (male-to-female ratio is 1:8). Although most individuals have sporadic disease, Cushing\u2019s syndrome may be found in MEN1 families and can result from ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors, primary adre-nal neoplasms, or an ectopic ACTH-secreting carcinoid tumor (more common in men) or bronchial adenoma (more common in women).Cushing\u2019s syndrome may be classified as ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent (Table 38-17). The most common cause of hypercortisolism is exogenous administration of steroids. However, approximately 70% of cases of endogenous Cush-ing\u2019s syndrome are caused by an ACTH-producing pituitary tumor.

            "content": "In patients in whom the diagnosis of Cushing\u2019s syndrome has been established clinically and confirmed by a finding of elevated free cortisol in the urine, suppression with large doses of dexamethasone will help to distinguish patients with Cushing\u2019s disease from those with steroid-producing tumors of the adrenal cortex or with the ectopic ACTH syndrome. Dexamethasone is given in a dosage of 0.5 mg orally every 6 hours for 2 days, followed by 2 mg orally every 6 hours for 2 days, and the urine is then assayed for cortisol or its metabolites (Liddle\u2019s test); or dexamethasone is given as a single dose of 8 mg at 11 pm, and the plasma cortisol is measured at 8 am the following day. In patients with Cushing\u2019s disease, the suppressant effect of dexamethasone usually produces a 50% reduction in hormone levels. In patients in whom suppression does not occur, the ACTH level will be low in the presence of a cortisol-producing adrenal tumor and elevated in patients with an ectopic ACTH-producing"

Failure to suppress urinary cortisol by 50% confirms the diagnosis of an ectopic ACTH-producing tumor. Patients suspected of having ectopic tumors should also undergo testing for MTC and pheochro-mocytoma.

Ovine CRH (1 \u03bcg/kg) is administered intravenously, followed by serial measurements of ACTH and cortisol at 15-minute intervals for 1 hour. Patients with a primary adrenal hypercortisolism exhibit a blunted response (ACTH peak <10 pg/mL), whereas those with ACTH-dependent Cushing\u2019s syndrome demonstrate a higher elevation of ACTH (>30 pg/mL).
