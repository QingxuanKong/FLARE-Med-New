            "content": "Because a fluctuating course often is seen in delirium, intermittent seizures may be overlooked when one is considering potential etiologies. Both nonconvulsive status epilepticus and recurrent focal or generalized seizures followed by postictal confusion can cause delirium; EEG remains essential for this diagnosis. Seizure activity spreading from an electrical focus in a mass or infarct can explain global cognitive dysfunction caused by relatively small lesions. It is very common for patients to experience delirium at the end of life in palliative care settings. This condition, sometimes described as terminal restlessness, must be identified and treated aggressively because it is an important cause of patient and family discomfort at the end of life. It should be remembered that these patients also may be suffering from more common etiologies of delirium such as systemic infection."

Patients on aspirin therapy and those with thrombocytopenia have alterations in platelet function and number, respectively, and not in the proteins of the clotting cascade. Therefore, both the PT and the aPTT are unaffected. Patients with end-stage liver disease have decreased ability to synthesize clotting proteins. They show prolonged PT and aPTT. 5.7. Which one of the following can be ruled out in a patient with thrombophilia? A. A deficiency of antithrombin III B. A deficiency of FIX C. A deficiency of protein C D. An excess of prothrombin E. Expression of FV Leiden Correct answer = B. Symptomatic deficiencies in clotting factors will present with a decreased ability to clot (coagulopathy). Thrombophilia, however, is characterized by an increased tendency to clot. Choices A, C, D, and E result in thrombophilia."
