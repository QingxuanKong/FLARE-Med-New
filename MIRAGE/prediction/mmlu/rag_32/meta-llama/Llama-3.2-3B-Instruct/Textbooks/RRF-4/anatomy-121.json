According to the documents, the needle is placed lateral to the anterior arch of the fauces (palatoglossal arch) in the oral cavity and is advanced along the medial border around the inferior third of the ramus of the mandible. This indicates that the needle should be positioned anterior to the medial pterygoid muscle. Furthermore, the needle should be advanced along the medial border, which suggests a lateral position relative to the medial pterygoid muscle.

            "content": "The LP needle (typically 20to 22-gauge) is inserted in the midline, midway between two spinous processes, and slowly advanced. The bevel of the needle should be maintained in a horizontal position, parallel to the direction of the dural fibers and with the flat portion of the bevel pointed upward; this minimizes injury to the fibers as the dura is penetrated. When LP is performed in patients who are sitting, the bevel should be maintained in the vertical position. In most adults, the needle is advanced 4\u20135 cm (1\u20132 in.) before the SAS is reached; the examiner usually recognizes entry as a sudden release of resistance, a \u201cpop.\u201d If no fluid appears despite apparently correct needle placement, then the needle may be rotated 90\u00b0\u2013180\u00b0. If there is still no fluid, the stylet is reinserted and the needle is advanced slightly. Some examiners halt needle advancement periodically to remove the stylet and check for flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). If the needle cannot be advanced because it"

A second mark is placed 4 cm proximally along the arm's long axis. The area is cleaned aseptically, and a l-percent lidocaine anesthetic track is injected along the planned insertion path. A.The insertion device is grasped at its gripper bubbles found on either side, and the needle cap is removed outward. The device can be seen within the needle bore. The needle bevel then pierces the skin at a 30-degree angle."

However, because atraumatic needles are more difficult to use, more attempts may be required to perform the LP, particularly in overweight patients. It may also be necessary to use an introducer with the atraumatic needle, which does not have the customary cutting, beveled tip. There is a low risk of needle damage, e.g., breakage, with the Sprotte atraumatic needle. Another strategy to decrease the incidence of headache is to replace the stylet before removing the LP needle."

            "content": "Venous drainage from the teeth can also be via vessels that pass through the mental foramen to connect with the facial vein. Veins from the gingivae also follow the arteries and ultimately drain into the facial vein or into the pterygoid plexus of veins. Lymphatic vessels from the teeth and gingivae drain mainly into submandibular, submental, and deep cervical nodes (Fig. 8.280). All nerves that innervate the teeth and gingivae are branches of the trigeminal nerve [V] (Figs. 8.281 and 8.282). The lower teeth are all innervated by branches from the inferior alveolar nerve, which originates in the infratemporal fossa from the mandibular nerve [V3] (Figs. 8.281 and 8.282). The inferior alveolar nerve and its accompanying vessels enter the mandibular foramen on the medial surface of the ramus of the mandible and travel anteriorly through the bone in the mandibular canal. Branches to the back teeth originate directly from the inferior alveolar nerve."
