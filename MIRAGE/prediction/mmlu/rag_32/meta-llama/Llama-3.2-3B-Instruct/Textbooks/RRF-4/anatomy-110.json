            "content": "The Task Force (2012) recommends procedural analgesia. Various pain relief techniques include lidocaine-prilocaine topical cream, local analgesia iniltration, dorsal penile nerve block, or ring block (Arnett, 1990; Stang, 1988). The dorsal penile nerve block or the ring block is superior to topical analgesia (Hardwick-Smith, 1998; Lander, 1997; Taddio, 1997). he use of a paciier dipped in sucrose is a useful adjunct to these methods (Kaufman, 2002). After appropriate penile cleansing, the ring block places a wheal of I-percent lidocaine at the base of the penis and then advances the needle in a 180-degree arc around the base of the penis. The needle is advanced first to one side and then to the other to achieve a circumferential ring of analgesia. he maximum dose of lidocaine is 1.0 mL. No vasoactive compounds such as epinephrine should ever be added to a local analgesic agent or circumcision."

Four major nerves cross the wrist: the median nerve, SRN, ulnar nerve, and dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve (Fig. 44-14C\u2013E). When blocking the median and ulnar nerves, beware of intraneural injection, which can cause irreversible neural scarring. If the patient complains of severe paresthesias with injection or high resistance is encountered, the needle should be repositioned.Hand Surgery Under Local AnesthesiaWide awake hand surgery is"

The dissection is carried medial to the sternocleido-mastoid. The superior belly of the omohyoid muscle is usually encountered just anterior to the common carotid artery. This muscle can be divided. The carotid fascia is incised, and the common carotid artery is exposed. The common carotid artery is mobilized cephalad toward the bifurcation. The dissection of the carotid bifurcation can cause reactive bradycardia related to stimulation of the carotid body. This reflex can be blunted with injection of lidocaine 1% into the carotid body or reversed with administration of intravenous atropine. A useful landmark in the dissection of the carotid bifurcation is the common facial vein. This vein can be ligated and divided. Frequently the 12th cranial nerve (hypoglossal nerve) traverses the carotid bifurcation just behind the common"
