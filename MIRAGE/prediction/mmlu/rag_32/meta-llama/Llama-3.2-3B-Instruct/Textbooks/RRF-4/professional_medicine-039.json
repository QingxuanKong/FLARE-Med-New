    "question": "A previously healthy 22-year-old college student is brought to the emergency department by her parents 20 minutes after they observed her having a seizure. After the seizure, she was confused and had difficulty thinking of some words. She has had a headache, cough, and fever for 3 days treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan. Her temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102\u00b0F). Neurologic examination shows diffuse hyperreflexia. On mental status examination, she is confused and has short-term memory deficits. She has difficulty naming objects and makes literal paraphasic errors. An MRI of the brain shows bitemporal hyperintensities. A lumbar puncture is done; cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows an erythrocyte count of 340/mm3 , a leukocyte count of 121/mm3 (88% monocytes), and a protein concentration of 78 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: Step 1: Review the patient's symptoms - headache, cough, fever, seizure, confusion, difficulty thinking of words, short-term memory deficits, difficulty naming objects, literal paraphasic errors, and hyperreflexia. Step 2: Review the patient's medical history - previously healthy, but recently treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan for 3 days. Step 3: Review the laboratory results - erythrocyte count of 340/mm3, leukocyte count of 121/mm3 (88% monocytes), and protein concentration of 78 mg/dL. Step 4: Review the imaging results - MRI of the brain shows bitemporal hyperintensities. Step 5: Consider the differential diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. Step 6: Analyze the options provided: A. Bacterial meningitis - the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows a high erythrocyte count and a predominance of monocytes, which is consistent with bacterial meningitis. However, the presence of bitemporal hyperintensities on the MRI and the patient's symptoms of confusion and short-term memory deficits suggest a more specific diagnosis. B. Dextromethorphan intoxication - dextromethorphan can cause seizures, confusion, and hallucinations, but the CSF analysis and imaging results do not support this diagnosis. C. Herpes simplex encephalitis - the patient's symptoms of confusion, short-term memory deficits, and difficulty naming objects are consistent with herpes simplex encephalitis. The presence of bitemporal hyperintensities on the MRI is also consistent with this diagnosis. D. HIV encephalopathy - the patient's symptoms and CSF analysis do not suggest HIV encephalopathy. Step 7: Based on the analysis, the most likely diagnosis is Herpes simplex encephalitis. Answer: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of confusion, short-term memory deficits, and difficulty naming objects, combined with the presence of bitemporal hyperintensities on the MRI and a high erythrocyte count and monocyte predominance in the CSF analysis, suggest Herpes simplex encephalitis as the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."

Diagnosis is greatly facilitated by CT scanning and MRI, which reveal bilateral but asymmetrical large, confluent, edematous lesions in the cerebral white matter with a myriad of punctate hemorrhages in gray and white matter (Fig. 35-5). The size of the lesions, their hemorrhagic character, and the extent of the surrounding edema distinguish them from the typical postinfectious ADEM. In many other ways they are similar, except for their severity. Many cases terminate fatally in 2 to 4 days, but in others, survival is longer. Patients with a similar clinical picture who are thought to have the same disease on the basis of brain biopsy examinations have recovered with almost no residual symptoms. In one of the fatal cases reported by"

The most extensive report was by Gomez-Aranda and colleagues, who described 50 adolescents and young adults, predominantly males, who developed multiple widely separated episodes of transient neurologic deficits lasting hours, accompanied by migraine-like headaches, sometimes with slight fever but no stiff neck. One-quarter of this group had a history of past migraine and a similar number had a viral-like illness within 3 weeks of the neurologic problem. The CSF contained from 10 to 760 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter, and the total protein was elevated. The transient neurologic deficits were mainly sensorimotor, often involving the hand and lips, and aphasia; only 6 patients had visual symptoms. The patients were asymptomatic between attacks and"

            "content": "The initial nervous system symptoms are rather nonspecific. They consist of headache, mild stiff neck, nausea and vomiting, malaise, and chronic fatigue, fluctuating over a period of weeks to months. Mild meningism without pleocytosis has been seen early in the syndrome and it may be worth repeating the studies in highly suspicious cases. These symptoms relate to the meningitis. There is a CSF lymphocytosis with cell counts from 50 to 3,000/mL and protein levels from 75 to 400 mg/dL, but both values are typically in the lower part of the range. Polymorphonuclear cells may be prominent in the early part of the illness. Usually the glucose content is normal. Somnolence, irritability, faulty memory, depressed mood, and behavioral changes have been interpreted as marks of encephalitis but are difficult to separate from the effects of meningitis. Seizures, choreic movements, cerebellar ataxia, and dementia have been reported but are infrequent. A myelitic syndrome, causing quadriparesis,"

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm.
