Central cyanosis is typically defined as a reduction in Sao2 of 85% or less. However, peripheral cyanosis can occur at higher oxygen saturation levels due to decreased peripheral blood flow. Nonetheless, the question asks about cyanosis, which generally refers to central cyanosis. Therefore, we can rely on the definition of central cyanosis. According to Document [6], cyanosis usually becomes manifest in an ascent to an altitude of 4000 m (13,000 ft), but in a clinical setting, it is generally considered to be present when Sao2 is 85% or less. Thus, the correct answer can be inferred from this definition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Arterial hypoxemia, i.e., a reduction of O2 saturation of arterial blood (Sao2), and consequent cyanosis are likely to be more marked when such depression of Pao2 results from pulmonary disease than when the depression occurs as the result of a decline in the fraction of oxygen in inspired air (Fio2).

In central cyanosis, the Sao2 is reduced or an abnormal hemoglobin derivative is present, and the mucous membranes and skin are both affected. Peripheral cyanosis is due to a slowing of blood flow and abnormally great extraction of O2 from normally saturated arterial blood; it results from vasoconstriction and diminished peripheral blood flow, such as occurs in cold exposure, shock, congestive failure, and peripheral vascular disease. Often in these conditions, the mucous membranes of the oral cavity or those beneath the tongue may be spared.

Thus, in a patient with severe anemia, the relative quantity of reduced hemoglobin in the venous blood may be very large when considered in relation to the total quantity of hemoglobin in the blood. However, since the concentration of the latter is markedly reduced, the absolute quantity of reduced hemoglobin may still be low, and, therefore, patients with severe anemia and even marked arterial desaturation may not display cyanosis. Conversely, the higher the total hemoglobin content, the greater the tendency toward cyanosis; thus, patients with marked polycythemia tend to be cyanotic at higher levels of Sao2 than patients with normal hematocrit values.

Calculation of pulse pressure variation as it would appear on bedside monitor. This provides a helpful and rapid assessment of fluid responsiveness in the critically ill mechanically ventilated patient.PPmax + PPmin2PPV (%) =PPmax \u2013 PPmin\u00d7 100InspirationArterial blood pressure (mmHg)ExpirationInspirationInspirationExpirationTimePPminPPmaxsolute decreases exponentially as the concentration of the sol-ute increases. In mammalian tissue, three compounds change their absorption pattern when oxygenated: cytochrome aa3, myoglobin, and hemoglobin. Because of the distinct absorption spectra of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, Beer\u2019s law can be used to detect their relative concentrations within tissue. Thus, the relative concentrations of the types of hemoglobin can be determined by measuring the change in light inten-sity as it passes through the tissue. Since"

Unnecessary measurements of the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure are discouraged as rupture of the pulmonary artery may occur.HEMODYNAMIC MEASUREMENTSEven in its simplest embodiment, the PAC is capable of pro-viding clinicians with a remarkable amount of information about the hemodynamic status of patients. Additional informa-tion may be obtained if various modifications of the standard PAC are employed. By combining data obtained through use of the PAC with results obtained by other means (i.e., blood hemoglobin concentration and oxyhemoglobin saturation), derived estimates of systemic oxygen transport and utilization can be calculated. Direct and derived parameters obtainable by bedside pulmonary arterial catheterization, along with sev-eral associated approximate normal ranges, are summarized in Table 13-1.Brunicardi_Ch13_p0433-p0452.indd"
