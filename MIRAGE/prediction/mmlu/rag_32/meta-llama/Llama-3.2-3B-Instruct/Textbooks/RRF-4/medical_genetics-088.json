Chimaerism refers to the presence of cells from two or more zygotes in a single individual. The question specifically asks about the presence of two or more cell lines from different zygotes in a single individual, which directly aligns with the definition of chimaerism.

The cells of these organisms are generally diploid: that is, they contain two slightly different copies, or homologs, of each chromosome, one from each parent. Sexual reproduction depends on a specialized nuclear division process called meiosis, which produces haploid cells carrying only a single copy of each chromosome. In many organisms, the haploid cells differentiate into specialized reproductive cells called gametes\u2014eggs and sperm in most species. In these species, the reproductive cycle ends when a sperm and egg fuse to form a diploid zygote, which has the potential to form a new individual. In this section, we consider the basic mechanisms and regulation of meiosis, with an emphasis on how they compare with those of mitosis. meiosis Includes Two Rounds of Chromosome segregation"

Phenotypic expression of mosaicism depends on several factors, including whether the cytogenetically abnormal cells involve the fetus, part of the fetus, just the placenta, or some combination. Of amnionic luid cultures, mosaicism is found in approximately 0.3 percent but may not reflect the fetal chromosomal complement (Carey, 2014). When the abnormal cells are present in only a single lask of amnionic luid, the inding is likely pseudomosaicism, caused by cell-culture artifact (Bui, 1984; Hsu, 1984). When abnormal cells involve multiple cultures, however, true mosaicism is more likely, and further testing may be warranted. A second cell line is veriied in 60 to 70 percent of these fetuses (Hsu, 1984; Worton, 1984)."

Alternative versions of the same gene are called alleles, and it is the divergence from their expected distribution during meiosis that is known as gene conversion.

Normalized to the size of the human genome, the mutation rate is one nucleotide change per 108 nucleotides per human generation. This is a slight underestimate because some mutations will be lethal and will therefore be absent from progeny; however, because relatively little of the human genome carries critical information, this consideration has only a small effect on the true mutation rate. It is estimated that approximately 100 cell divisions occur in the germ line from the time of conception to the time of production of the eggs and sperm that go on to make the next generation.

Somatic mosaicism is characterized by a patchy distribution of genetically altered somatic cells.

Mitochondrial inheritance in yeasts is therefore biparental: both parents contribute equally to the mitochondrial gene pool of the progeny. However, during the course of the subsequent asexual, vegetative growth, the mitochondria become distributed more or less randomly to daughter cells. After a few generations, the mitochondria of any given cell contain only the DNA from one or the other parent cell, because only a small sample of the mitochondrial DNA passes from the mother cell to the bud of the daughter cell. This process is known as mitotic segregation, and it gives rise to a distinct form of inheritance that is called non-Mendelian, or cytoplasmic inheritance, in contrast to the Mendelian inheritance of nuclear genes."

To produce monoclonal antibodies against a specific antigen, a mouse or rat is immunized with that antigen. The activated B lymphocytes are then isolated from the lymphatic tissue (spleen or lymph nodes) of the animal and fused with the myeloma cell line. This fusion produces a hybridoma, an immortalized individual antibody-secreting cell line. To obtain monoclonal antibodies against rat actin molecules, for example, the B lymphocytes from the lymphatic organs of immunized rabbits must be fused with myeloma cells."

            "content": "Consider the Drosophila Even-skipped (Eve) gene, whose expression plays an important part in the development of the Drosophila embryo. If this gene is inactivated by mutation, many parts of the embryo fail to form, and the embryo dies early in development. As discussed in Chapter 21, at the stage of development when Eve begins to be expressed, the embryo is a single giant cell containing multiple nuclei in a common cytoplasm. This cytoplasm contains a mixture of transcription regulators that are distributed unevenly along the length of the embryo, thus providing positional information that distinguishes one part of the embryo from another (Figure 7\u201326). Although the nuclei are initially identical, they rapidly begin to express different genes because they are exposed to different transcription regulators. For example, the nuclei near the anterior end of the developing embryo are exposed to a set of transcription regulators that is distinct from the set that influences nuclei at the"

            "content": "Cancers Become More and More heterogeneous as They Progress From simple histology, looking at stained tissue sections, it is clear that some tumors contain distinct sectors, all clearly cancerous, but differing in appearance because they differ genetically: the cancer cell population is heterogeneous. Evidently, within the initial clone of cancerous cells, additional mutations have arisen and thrived, creating diverse subclones. Today, the ability to analyze cancer genomes lets us look much deeper into the process. One approach involves taking samples from different regions of a primary tumor and from the metastases that it has spawned. With modern methods, it is even possible to take representative single cells and analyze their genomes. Such studies reveal a classic picture of Darwinian evolution, occurring on a time scale of months or years rather than millions of years, but governed by the same rules of natural selection (Figure 20\u201330)."
