    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of an individual carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker, each with a frequency of 0.2. Since the alleles are not necessarily linked, we can assume that the genotype is a product of two independent events. The probability of an individual carrying one of each allele is the product of the probabilities of each event. So, we need to calculate the probability of an individual carrying one of each allele and then square it to get the probability of carrying both alleles.\\n\\nThe probability of an individual carrying one of each allele is 0.2 x 0.2 = 0.04. However, this is the probability of carrying one of each allele in one pair of alleles. Since there are two pairs of alleles (one from the mother and one from the father), we need to square the result to get the probability of carrying both alleles: 0.04^2 = 0.0016.\\n\\nHowever, this is not among the answer choices. This suggests that the question is actually asking for the probability of an individual being a homozygous genotype for both alleles, which would be the square of the probability of an individual carrying one of each allele: 0.04^2 = 0.0016.\\n\\nBut the question asks for the likelihood of an individual in a population carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker, each of which has a frequency of 0.2. This is equivalent to the probability of an individual being a homozygous genotype for both alleles, which is 0.04^2 = 0.0016. However, the question is asking for the probability of an individual in a population, not the probability of an individual being homozygous for both alleles. The correct answer should be the probability of an individual in a population carrying two specific alleles, which is given by the formula 2pq, where p and q are the frequencies of the alleles. In this case, p = q = 0.2, so the probability is 2 x 0.2 x 0.2 = 0.08.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 0.08.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

With the possible exception of identical twins, the genome of each human differs in DNA sequence from that of every other person on Earth. Using primer pairs targeted at genome sequences that are known to be highly variable in the human population, PCR makes it possible to generate a distinctive DNA fingerprint for any individual (Figure 8\u201339).

The spread of neutral mutations is not as rapid as the spread of the rare strongly advantageous mutations.

            "content": "The answer to this question depends on the functional consequences of the mutation. If the mutation has a significantly deleterious effect, it will simply be eliminated by purifying selection and will not become fixed. (In the most extreme case, the individual carrying the mutation will die without producing progeny.) Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population. Because humans reproduce sexually and genetic recombination occurs each time a gamete is formed (discussed in Chapter 5), the genome of each individual who has inherited the mutation will be a unique recombinational mosaic of segments inherited from a large number of ancestors. The selected mutation along with a modest amount of neighboring sequence\u2014ultimately inherited from the individual in which the mutation occurred\u2014will simply be one piece of this huge mosaic."

The classic (MHC class Ia) HLA-A, -B, and -C loci, the products of which are integral par-ticipants in the immune response to intracellular infections, tumors, and allografts, are expressed in all nucleated cells and are highly poly-morphic in the population. Polymorphism refers to a high degree of allelic variation within a genetic locus that leads to extensive variation between different individuals expressing different alleles. More than 2000 alleles at HLA-A, nearly 3000 alleles at HLA-B, and more than 1700 at HLA-C have been identified in different human populations, making this the most highly polymorphic segment known within the human genome. Each of the alleles at these loci encodes a heavy chain (also called an \u03b1 chain) that associates noncovalently with the nonpoly-morphic light chain \u03b22-microglobulin, encoded on"

Each individual expresses only one set of HLA genes. It is believed that the polymorphism of MHC genes evolved to enable display of and response to any conceivable microbial peptide encountered in the environment. As a result of the polymorphism, a virtually infinite number of combinations of HLA molecules exists in the population. The HLA genes are closely linked on chromosome 6, so they are passed from parent to offspring en bloc and behave like a single locus with respect to their inheritance patterns. Each set of maternal and paternal HLA genes is referred to as an HLA haplotype. Because of this mode of inheritance, the probability that siblings will share the same two HLA haplotypes is 25%. By contrast, in most populations the probability that an unrelated donor will share the same"
