    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Macrostomia is a congenital condition characterized by an unusually large tongue. The tongue is formed from the fusion of the lingual swellings, which are outgrowths of the first pharyngeal arches. The lingual swellings fuse to form the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, while the posterior third is derived from the third pharyngeal pouch. The fusion of the lingual swellings is a critical process in the development of the tongue. Therefore, failure of fusion of the lingual swellings would result in a tongue that is larger than normal, leading to macrostomia.\\n\\nTo determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. maxillary and mandibular processes: The maxillary and mandibular processes are involved in the formation of the jaw and face, but they are not directly related to the formation of the tongue.\\n\\nB. left and right mandibular processes: The mandibular processes are involved in the formation of the lower jaw, but they are not directly related to the formation of the tongue.\\n\\nC. maxillary and frontonasal processes: The maxillary and frontonasal processes are involved in the formation of the upper jaw and the nose, but they are not directly related to the formation of the tongue.\\n\\nD. mandibular and hyoid arches: The mandibular arches are involved in the formation of the lower jaw, while the hyoid arches are involved in the formation of the laryngeal cartilages and the muscles of the tongue. The fusion of the lingual swellings is closely related to the development of the hyoid arches, which are the precursors to the muscles of the tongue. Therefore, failure of fusion of the mandibular and hyoid arches would result in a tongue that is larger than normal, leading to macrostomia.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is D. mandibular and hyoid arches.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

In most individuals, the main pancreatic duct (the duct of Wirsung) joins the common bile duct just proximal to the papilla of Vater, and the accessory pancreatic duct (the duct of Santorini) drains into the duodenum through a separate minor papilla. Pancreas divisum is caused by a failure of fusion of the fetal duct systems of the dorsal and ventral pancreatic primordia. As a result, the bulk of the pancreas (formed by the dorsal pancreatic primordium) drains into the duodenum through the small-caliber minor papilla. The duct of Wirsung in individuals with divisum drains only a small portion of the head of the gland through the papilla of Vater. More than 95% of individuals are asymptomatic. The remaining 5% develop acute or chronic pancreatitis, possibly related to inadequate drainage of pancreatic secretions through the minor papilla."

In the 1960s, Weston and Johnston used animal mod-els to demonstrate the vast contributions of neural crest cells to mesynchymal development of the face. They postulated that failure of these cells to penetrate into the developing face could lead to breakdown of the surrounding epithelia and result in atypical craniofacial clefts. The last 30 years has seen contin-ued refinement of this theory. Most recent evidence suggests that neural crest cells form developmental rests or ossification centers within the well-known facial processes.

Atresia can occur in several permutations, the common denominator being developmental failure of fusion between the proximal and distal esophagus associated with a tracheoesophageal fistula, most commonly with the distal segment excluded. Alternatively, there can be an H-type configuration in which esophageal fusion has occurred, but with a tracheoesophageal fistula. Esophageal atresia is usually recognized and corrected surgically within the first few days of life. Later life complications include dysphagia from anastomotic strictures or absent peristalsis and reflux, which can be severe.

The renal water loss combined with hyperosmolarity due to increased levels of glucose in the blood depletes intracellular water, triggering osmoreceptors in the brain. This sequence of events generates intense thirst (polydipsia). The deficiency of insulin leads to the catabolism of proteins and fats. Gluconeogenic amino acids produced by proteolysis are taken up and by the liver and used as building blocks for glucose. The catabolism of proteins and fats induces a negative energy balance, which in turn leads to increasing appetite (polyphagia), thus completing the classic triad. Despite the increased appetite, catabolic effects dominate, resulting in weight loss and muscle weakness.

            "content": "malformation, failure of the growth of the mandible during the first weeks of gestation, results in micrognathia, which forces the normal-sized tongue into an unusual position. The abnormally placed tongue blocks the fusion of the palatal shelves, which normally come together in the midline to produce the hard and soft palate; this leads to the presence of a U-shaped cleft palate. After delivery, the normal-sized tongue in the smaller than normal oral cavity leads to airway obstruction, a potentially life-threatening complication. Pierre Robin sequence comprises a triad of anomalies (micrognathia, U-shaped cleft palate, and obstructive apnea) which results from a single malformation, the failure of the jaw to grow at a critical time during gestation. Many children with Pierre Robin syndrome have Stickler syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in collagen genes. Stickler syndrome also manifests with ocular and musculoskeletal abnormalities."

            "content": "The tetralogy of Fallot, the most common cyanotic congenital heart disorder diagnosed soon after birth, classically consists of four abnormalities: pulmonary stenosis, VSD, overriding aorta (originating to a varying degree from the right ventricle), and right ventricular hypertrophy. The underdevelopment of the right ventricle and pulmonary stenosis reduce blood flow to the lungs, leading to reduced volume of oxygenated blood returning to the heart. The defect in the interventricular septum causes mixing of oxygenated and nonoxygenated blood. The mixed blood is then delivered by the aorta to the major organs, resulting in poor oxygenation and cyanosis. Infants can present with cyanosis at birth or develop episodes of cyanosis while feeding or crying (tet spells). Most affected infants require surgical intervention. The advent of cardiopulmonary bypass was crucial in delivering highly satisfactory surgical results."

There-fore, the plasma level of magnesium may be a poor indicator of total body stores in the presence of hypoalbuminemia. Mag-nesium should be replaced until levels are in the upper limit of normal. The normal dietary intake is approximately 20 mEq/d and is excreted in both the feces and urine. The kidneys have a remarkable ability to conserve magnesium, with renal excretion <1 mEq/d during magnesium deficiency.Hypermagnesemia Hypermagnesemia is rare but can be seen with severe renal insufficiency and parallel changes in potas-sium excretion. Magnesium-containing antacids and laxatives can produce toxic levels in patients with renal failure. Excess intake in conjunction with total parenteral nutrition (TPN), or, rarely, massive trauma, thermal injury, and severe acidosis, may be associated with symptomatic hypermagnesemia. Clini-cal"

            "content": "Treatment of Scheuermann kyphosis is similar to idiopathic scoliosis. It is dependent on the degree of deformity, skeletal maturity, and the presence or absence of pain. Nonoperative treatment begins with bracing. Surgical fusion is done for patients who have completed growth, have a severe deformity, or have intractable pain. Congenital kyphosis is a failure of the formation of all or part of the vertebral body (with preservation of posterior elements) or failure of anterior segmentation of the spine, or both. Severe deformities are found at birth and tend to rapidly progress. Progression will not cease until the end of skeletal growth. A progressive spine deformity may result in neurologic deficit. Treatment of congenital kyphosis is often surgical. Figure 202-4 Note the sharp break in the contour of a child with kyphosis.

            "content": "As already stated, the usual cause of diabetes insipidus DI is a lack of vasopressin (ADH) secretion resulting from a lesion of the neurohypophysis. This leads to a reduction of absorption of water in the renal tubules. As a consequence, there is diuresis of low-osmolar urine, reduction in blood volume, and increased thirst and drinking of water (polydipsia) in an attempt to maintain osmolality. A congenital abnormality of renal tubular epithelium or destruction of the epithelium ultimately has a similar effect, but is termed nephrogenic DI. Notably, this type of DI may be provoked by lithium toxicity."

            "content": "Most hypouricemia results from increased renal uric acid excretion. The finding of normal amounts of uric acid in a 24-h urine collection from an individual with hypouricemia is evidence for a renal cause. Medications with uricosuric properties (Table 431e-1) include aspirin (at doses >2.0 g/d), losartan, fenofibrate, x-ray contrast materials, and 431e-5 glyceryl guaiacolate. Total parenteral hyperalimentation can also cause hypouricemia, possibly a result of the high glycine content of the infusion formula. Other causes of increased urate clearance include conditions such as neoplastic disease, hepatic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and inappropriate secretion of vasopressin; defects in renal tubular transport such as primary Fanconi syndrome and Fanconi syndromes caused by Wilson\u2019s disease, cystinosis, multiple myeloma, and heavy metal toxicity; and isolated congenital defects in the bidirectional transport of uric acid. Hypouricemia can be a familial disorder that is generally"
