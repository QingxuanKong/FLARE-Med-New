The internal jugular vein is preferred because the external jugular vein is valved and not directly in line with the superior vena cava and right atrium. Nevertheless, the external jugular vein has been used to discriminate between high and low central venous pressure (CVP) when tested among medical students, residents, and attending physicians. Precise estimation of the central venous or right atrial pressure from bedside assessment of the jugular venous waveform has proved difficult. Venous pressure traditionally has been measured as the vertical distance between the top of the jugular venous pulsation and the sternal inflection point (angle of Louis). A distance >4.5 cm at 30\u00b0 elevation is considered abnormal. However, the actual distance between the mid-right atrium and the angle of Louis varies considerably as a function of"

The a wave occurs with the rise in pressure caused by atrial contraction. The c wave is caused by impact of the common carotid artery with the adjacent jugular vein and, to some extent, by the abrupt closure of the tricuspid valve in early ventricular systole. The v wave reflects the rise in pressure associated with atrial filling. Except for the c wave, the CHAPTER 16 Elements of Cardiac Function venous pulse curve closely resembles the left atrial pressure curve. At the end of ventricular ejection, a volume of blood approximately equal to that ejected during systole remains in the ventricular cavities. This residual volume is fairly constant in normal hearts. However, residual volume decreases somewhat when the heart rate increases or when peripheral vascular resistance has diminished."

The main limitation of this technique is that it may be impossible to measure pressures in the first and second toes due to preexisting ulceration.Pulse Volume Recording. In patients with noncompressible vessels, segmental plethysmography can be used to determine underlying arterial occlusive disease. Cuffs placed at different levels on the leg detect changes in blood volume and produce a pulse volume recording (PVR) when connected to a plethysmo-graph (Fig. 23-2). To obtain accurate PVR waveforms, the cuff is inflated to 60 to 65 mmHg, so as to detect volume changes without causing arterial occlusion. Pulse volume tracings are suggestive of proximal disease if the upstroke of the pulse is not brisk, the peak of the wave tracing is rounded, and there is disappearance of the dicrotic notch.Although isolated segmental limb pressures and PVR mea-surements are 85% accurate when"

            "content": "Cardiac The jugular venous pulse is often normal in patients with acute myocardial ischemia but may reveal characteristic patterns with pericardial tamponade or acute right ventricular dysfunction (Chaps. 267 and 288). Cardiac auscultation may reveal a third or, more commonly, a fourth heart sound, reflecting myocardial systolic or diastolic dysfunction. Murmurs of mitral regurgitation or a harsh murmur of a ventricular-septal defect may indicate mechanical complications of STEMI. A murmur of aortic insufficiency may be a complication of proximal aortic dissection. Other murmurs may reveal underlying cardiac disorders contributory to ischemia (e.g., aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Pericardial friction rubs reflect pericardial inflammation."

            "content": "venous collapse impedes venous return to the heart. Hence, it limits the maximal value of cardiac output to 7 L/minute in this example (see Fig. 19.3 ), regardless of the capabilities of the pump. Factors That Influence the Vascular Function Curve Dependence of Venous Pressure on Cardiac Output According to experimental and clinical observations, changes in cardiac output do indeed evoke the alterations in Pa and Pv that have been predicted by the simplified model in Fig. 19.2 The vascular function curve is affected by variations in total blood volume. During circulatory standstill (zero cardiac output), mean circulatory pressure depends only on total vascular compliance and blood volume. For a given vascular compliance, mean circulatory pressure is increased when blood volume is expanded (hypervolemia) and is decreased when blood volume is diminished (hypovolemia). This relationship is illustrated by the y-axis intercepts in Fig."

            "content": "The physical examination begins with an assessment of vital signs and oxygen saturation to gauge whether there is evidence of life-threatening bleeding. Tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased oxygen saturation mandate a more expedited evaluation of hemoptysis. A specific focus on respiratory and cardiac examinations is important; these examinations should include inspection of the nares, auscultation of the lungs and heart, assessment of the lower extremities for symmetric or asymmetric edema, and evaluation for jugular venous distention. Clubbing of the digits may suggest underlying lung diseases such as bronchogenic carcinoma or bronchiectasis, which predispose to hemoptysis. Similarly, mucocutaneous telangiectasias should raise the specter of pulmonary arterial-venous malformations."
