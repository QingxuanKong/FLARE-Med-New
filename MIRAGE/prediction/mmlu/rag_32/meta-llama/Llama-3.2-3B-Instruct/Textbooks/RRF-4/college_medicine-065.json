In each case, a bulkier two-ring base (a purine; see Panel 2\u20136, pp. 100\u2013101) is paired with a single-ring base (a pyrimidine): A always pairs with T, and G with C (Figure 4\u20134). This complementary base-pairing enables the base pairs to be packed in the energetically most favorable arrangement in the interior of the double helix. In this arrangement, each base pair is of similar width, thus holding the sugar-phosphate backbones a constant distance apart along the DNA molecule. To maximize the efficiency of base-pair packing, the two sugar-phosphate backbones wind around each other to form a right-handed double helix,"

II. DNA STRUCTURE DNA is a polymer of deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates (dNMP) covalently linked by 3\u2032\u21925\u2032-phosphodiester bonds. With the exception of a few viruses that contain single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), DNA exists as a double-stranded molecule (dsDNA), in which the two strands wind around each other, forming a double helix. [Note: The sequence of the linked dNMP is primary structure, whereas the double helix is secondary structure.] In eukaryotic cells, DNA is found associated with various types of proteins (known collectively as nucleoprotein) present in the nucleus, whereas the protein\u2013DNA complex is present in a non\u2013membrane-bound region known as the nucleoid in prokaryotes.

            "content": "As discussed previously, the DNA double helix is normally very stable: the two DNA strands are locked together firmly by many hydrogen bonds formed between the bases on each strand. To begin DNA replication, the double helix must first be opened up and the two strands separated to expose unpaired bases. As we shall see, the process of DNA replication is begun by special initiator proteins that bind to double-strand DNA and pry the two strands apart, breaking the hydrogen bonds between the bases. leading strand of fork 1 of fork 2 leading strand lagging strand of fork 1 of fork 2 Figure 5\u201323 A replication bubble formed by replication-fork initiation. This diagram outlines the major steps in the initiation of replication forks at replication origins. The structure formed at the last step, in which both strands of the parental DNA helix have been separated from each other and serve as templates for DNA synthesis, is called a replication bubble."

If the sugar is ribose, a ribonucleoside is produced, and if the sugar is 2-deoxyribose, a deoxyribonucleoside is produced (Fig. 22.3A). The ribonucleosides of A, G, C, and U are named adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and uridine, respectively. The deoxyribonucleosides of A, G, C, and T have the added prefix deoxy-(for example, deoxyadenosine).

It is also useful for detecting proteins that contain certain amino acids. Using specific illuminating wavelengths, UV spectrophotometric measurements are commonly made through the UV microscope to determine quantitatively the amount of DNA and RNA in individual cells. As described in the Folder 1.2 on page 7, Feulgen microspectrophoto metry is used clinically to evaluate the degree of ploidy (multiples of normal DNA quantity) in sections of tumors. The polarizing microscope uses the fact that highly ordered molecules or arrays of molecules can rotate the angle of the plane of polarized light. The polarizing microscope is a simple modification of the light microscope in which a polarizing filter (the polarizer) is located between the light source and the specimen, and a second polarizer (the analyzer) is located between the objective lens and the viewer."

In this way, the energetically unfavorable nick-sealing reaction is driven by being coupled to the energetically favorable process of ATP hydrolysis. could unwind the DNA double helix by moving in the 5\u02b9-to-3\u02b9 direction along one 5\u02dc 3\u02dc strand or in the 3\u02b9-to-5\u02b9 direction along the other. In fact, both types of DNA helicase exist. In the best-understood replication systems in bacteria, a helicase moving 5\u02b9 to 3\u02b9 along the lagging-strand template appears to have the predominant role, for reasons that will become clear shortly."

The molecule seemed too simple: a long polymer composed of only four types of nucleotide subunits, which resemble one another chemically. Early in the 1950s, DNA was examined by x-ray diffraction analysis, a technique for determining the three-dimensional atomic structure of a molecule (discussed in Chapter 8). The early x-ray diffraction results indicated that DNA was composed of two strands of the polymer wound into a helix. The observation that DNA was double-stranded provided one of the major clues that led to the Watson\u2013Crick model for DNA structure that, as soon as it was proposed in 1953, made DNA\u2019s potential for replication and information storage apparent.
