    "predict": "After analyzing the provided documents, I've broken down the question into smaller parts to arrive at the correct answer. Here's my step-by-step thinking: 1. **Understanding the concept of a \"fixed action pattern\":** A fixed action pattern is a complex behavior that is automatically executed in response to a specific stimulus, without the need for further input or learning. This concept is mentioned in Document [1] (Title: Neurology_Adams), where it is stated that \"the amygdala of the unanesthetized cat yields a variety of motor and vegetative responses\" to electrical stimulation. 2. **Eliminating options:** Based on the definition of a fixed action pattern, we can eliminate option A, as it implies a learned behavior that is triggered by the correct stimulus at the appropriate time in an animal's life, which is not necessarily a fixed action pattern. 3. **Analyzing option B:** A fixed action pattern is typically triggered by sensory feedback, not in the absence of it. Therefore, option B is incorrect. 4. **Considering option C:** While some motor responses may be terminated spontaneously, this is not a defining characteristic of a fixed action pattern. A fixed action pattern is a complex behavior that is automatically executed in response to a specific stimulus, without the need for further input or termination. 5. **Evaluating option D:** A fixed action pattern is indeed triggered by a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment. This option aligns with the definition of a fixed action pattern, as mentioned in Document [1] (Title: Neurology_Adams). **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A fixed action pattern is a complex behavior that is automatically executed in response to a specific stimulus, without the need for further input or learning. The definition of a fixed action pattern matches option D, which states that it occurs in response to a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

In primitive nervous systems, only simple receptor\u2013effector reflex loops exist to respond to external stimuli. In higher animals and humans, the SNS retains the ability to respond to stimuli from the external environment through the action of effector cells (such as skeletal muscle), but the neuronal responses are infinitely more varied. They range from simple reflexes that require only the spinal cord to complex operations of the brain, including memory and learning. The autonomic part of the nervous system regulates the function of internal organs."

As mentioned in the introductory section, bilateral removal of the amygdaloid nuclei in the macaque greatly reduces the expressions of both fear and anger. Electrical stimulation in or near the amygdala of the unanesthetized cat yields a variety of motor and vegetative responses. One of these has been referred to as the fear or flight response, in which the animal appears frightened, and runs away and hides; another is the anger or defense reaction, characterized by growling, hissing, and piloerection. However, structures other than the amygdaloid nuclei are also involved in these reactions. Lesions in the ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus (which receive abundant input from the amygdaloid nuclei) have been shown to cause aggressive behavior, and bilateral ablation of Brodmann area 24 (rostral cingulate gyrus) has produced the opposite state\u2014tameness and reduced aggressiveness\u2014at least in some species."

Thus modulation of feeding behavior may be just one of several actions used to defend a body weight set point. Evidence for this is that although lesions cause an initial period of dynamic weight gain in which hyperphagia is present, this is followed by a static period in which the higher weight is maintained without hyperphagia. Moreover, animals with a lesion in the ventromedial hypothalamus that are fed a fixed (normal) amount of food to prevent hyperphagia nonetheless become obese, which implies changes in the regulation of other metabolic processes. Last, lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus have been shown to alter levels of energy expenditure."

For example, the force of a mechanical stimulus to the skin can be encoded in the firing rate of the primary afferent neuron that innervates the skin; the greater the force applied to the skin, the larger the resulting receptor potential in the primary afferent neuron will be and, as a consequence, the faster the rate of action potentials triggered by the receptor potential will be. Research has shown many neurons employ rate coding in the sense that the firing rate of a neuron shows a consistent relationship to particular parameters of sensory stimuli, upcoming movements, or other aspects of behavior."

In a mammal\u2019s brain, the region called the hippocampus has a special role in learning. When it is destroyed on both sides of the brain, the ability to form new memories is largely lost, although previous long-established memories remain. Some synapses in the hippocampus show a striking form of synaptic plasticity with repeated use: whereas occasional single action potentials in the presynaptic cells leave no lasting trace, a short burst of repetitive firing causes long-term potentiation (LTP), such that subsequent single action potentials in the presynaptic cells evoke a greatly enhanced response in the postsynaptic cells. The effect lasts hours, days, or weeks, according to the number and intensity of the bursts of repetitive firing. Only the synapses that were activated exhibit LTP; synapses that have remained quiet on the same postsynaptic cell are not affected. However, while"

The orexin system, like the monoamine systems, projects widely throughout the CNS to influence physiology and behavior. In particular, orexin neurons exhibit firing patterns associated with wakefulness and project to and activate monoamine and acetylcholine neurons involved in sleep-wake cycles (see also Chapter 22).

Other systems, like those controlling vision or the metabolic response to some hormones, are highly responsive over a much broader range of signal strengths. We will see that broad dynamic range is often achieved by adaptation mechanisms that adjust the responsiveness of the system according to the prevailing amount of signal. 4. Persistence of a response can vary greatly. A transient response of less than a second is appropriate in some synaptic responses, for example, while a prolonged or even permanent response is required in cell fate decisions during development. Numerous mechanisms, including positive feedback, can be used to alter the duration and reversibility of a response. 5."

This process is called inductive signaling.

The nervous system has other capabilities, so-called integrative or higher functions, that are less directly tied to specific sensory modalities or motor behavior.

For many sensory neurons, the stimulus-response function approximates an exponential curve with an exponent that can be less than, equal to, or greater than 1. Stimulus-response functions with fractional exponents characterize many mechanoreceptors. Thermoreceptors, which detect changes in temperature, have linear stimulus-response curves (exponent of 1). Nociceptors, which detect painful stimuli, may have linear or positively accelerating stimulus-response functions (i.e., the exponent for these curves is 1 or greater).

Although Hox gene expression is initiated in the embryo, it is subsequently maintained by the action of chromatin-binding proteins of the Polycomb and Trithorax group, which stamp the chromatin of the Hox complex with a heritable record of its embryonic state of repression or activation, respectively. Hox complexes homologous to that of Drosophila are found in virtually every type of animal, where they help pattern the A-P axis of the body."

            "content": "The Local Response With regard to the experiment shown in Fig. 5.1, if larger depolarizing current pulses are injected, the voltage response of the membrane no longer resembles that of a passive RC circuit. This is most easily observed with pulses that elicit depolarizations either just below or to the threshold membrane potential for an action potential but fail to evoke an action potential (tracings 0.89 and 1.0; the threshold membrane potential can be defined as the voltage at which the probability of evoking an action potential is 50%). In these cases, the voltage response shape is altered from that of the passive responses because the stimulus has changed the membrane potential sufficiently to cause the opening of significant numbers of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels (described later). Also, note the upward deviation from linearity for the corresponding points in the I-V curve (see"
