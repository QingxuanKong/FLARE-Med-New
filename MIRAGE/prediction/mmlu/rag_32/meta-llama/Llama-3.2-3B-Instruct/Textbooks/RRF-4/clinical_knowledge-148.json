A large goiter can compress surrounding structures such as the trachea, esophagus, and other vital organs, leading to various symptoms. Let's evaluate each option: A) Stridor due to compression of the oesophagus is a possible complication, but it is not the most common symptom. B) Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) is indeed an indication for surgery, but it is not the most specific symptom of a large goiter. C) Hoarseness due to compression of the trachea is a common symptom of a large goiter, especially if the goiter is compressing the recurrent laryngeal nerve. D) A large goiter can lead to a more florid thyrotoxicosis (excessive production of thyroid hormones) than a smaller goiter, but this is not the most direct complication.

The data revealed that 1535 adverse events (14.4%) led to significant negative patient expe-riences (1391 injuries and 144 deaths). Additionally, the abso-lute number of reports increased 32 times since 2006, while in the same time period, the number of cases performed has only increased tenfold.58 Despite the large number of reports con-tained within this database, the extent to which it is a true rep-resentation of the complications associated with robotic surgery is uncertain due to the lack of comprehensive and mandatory reporting.59Despite the numbers and trends reported from this data-base, few prospective, controlled trials exist that examine the risks and benefits of robotic surgery with those of open and laparoscopic surgery.

Failure of medical management may be the indication for surgery if symp-toms persist despite aggressive therapy for several months or if symptoms recur whenever aggressive therapy is tapered.

Growth retardation constitutes an indication for surgery in 30% of children with Crohn\u2019s disease.One of the most common indications for surgical interven-tion is intestinal obstruction.

Each of these neurologic complications can occur in the absence of the characteristic fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy of infectious mononucleosis. The same is true of M. pneumoniae. In these two diseases there is still uncertainty as to whether they are true infectious encephalitides or postinfectious complications, as discussed in Chap. 31. Evidence from PCR testing of spinal fluid is consistent with a direct infection in some cases. Varicella zoster and CMV are other herpes-type viruses that may cause encephalitis. They are discussed in relation to the particular clinical settings in which they occur.

A treatment goal for the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) caused by acute bronchitis is to insure appropriate nutrition without increasing the respiratory quotient (RQ), which is the ratio of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced to oxygen consumed, thereby minimizing the production of CO2. Less CO2 is produced from the metabolism of fat (RQ = 0.7) than from the catabolism of carbohydrate (RQ =1.0). Fat contains fewer oxygen atoms. Fat is calorically denser than is carbohydrate.
