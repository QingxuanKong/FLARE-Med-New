    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option in relation to the provided documents about spastic paraplegia.\\n\\nOption A: Multiple Sclerosis can cause this neurological pattern - This is true. Document [10] states that spastic paraplegic or paraparetic gait is a major manifestation of cerebral diplegia, and this condition can be caused by multiple sclerosis, as well as other diseases such as syringomyelia, chronic meningomyelitis, and spinal cord compression or traumatic injury.\\n\\nOption B: Proprioceptive loss is a common feature - This is not necessarily true. Document [20] states that in peripheral nerve diseases, motor loss tends to involve the distal muscles of the legs more than the proximal ones, and sensory loss is also more prominent in the distal segments of the limbs. However, proprioceptive loss is not explicitly mentioned as a common feature of spastic paraplegia.\\n\\nOption C: Coordination in the legs is affected - This is true. Document [10] states that the spastic paraplegic or paraparetic gait is characterized by a scissor-like gait, where the legs are extended or slightly bent at the knees and the thighs are strongly adducted, indicating coordination problems in the legs.\\n\\nOption D: The tone is normal or flaccid - This is not true. Document [30] states that the typical case of spastic paraplegia begins with stiffness in one leg, then in the other, and is characterized by spasticity predominating over weakness, indicating increased muscle tone.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

A lack of sensory symptoms and signs and sparing of sphincteric function until late in the illness are important diagnostic features. A number of adult cases are \u201ccomplicated\u201d in the sense that the spastic paraplegia is associated with cerebellar ataxia or dementia. By contrast, primary lateral sclerosis, a sporadic form of degenerative disease of the motor system, is characterized by a pure spastic paraplegia and bulbar spastic palsy either initially or with progression, the result of changes that are confined to the corticospinal pathways. These disorders are discussed extensively with the heredodegenerative diseases in Chap. 38, and the myelopathy associated with adrenoleukodystrophy, in Chap. 36."

Exercise-induced weakness is a characteristic symptom of MS. The weakness is of the upper motor neuron type (Chap. 30) and is usually accompanied by other pyramidal signs such as spasticity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski signs. Occasionally a tendon reflex may be lost (simulating a lower motor neuron lesion) if an MS lesion disrupts the afferent reflex fibers in the spinal cord (see Fig. 30-2). Spasticity (Chap. 30) is commonly associated with spontaneous and movement-induced muscle spasms. More than 30% of MS patients have moderate to severe spasticity, especially in the legs. This is often accompanied by painful spasms interfering with ambulation, work, or self-care. Occasionally spasticity provides support for the body weight during ambulation, and in these cases, treatment of spasticity may actually do more harm than good."

Symptoms usually begin in the third or fourth decade, presenting as progressive spastic weakness beginning in the distal lower extremities; however, there are variants with onset so early that the differential diagnosis includes cerebral palsy. FSP typically has a long survival, presumably because respiratory function is spared. Late in the illness, there may be urinary urgency and incontinence and sometimes fecal incontinence; sexual function tends to be preserved. In pure forms of FSP, the spastic leg weakness is often accompanied by posterior column (vibration and position) abnormalities and disturbance of bowel and bladder function.

In 2 of the cases, a sural nerve biopsy revealed a typical hypertrophic polyneuropathy; in a third case there was only a depletion of large myelinated fibers.

The development of paraplegia in flexion (extreme flexion of the hips and knees, as in a fetal position) relates also to the level of the lesion, being seen most often with cervical lesions and progressively less often with more caudal ones. Greatly troubling to the spinal patient are repeated flexor spasms, which are more frequent with higher lesions of the cord, and the ensuing contractures ultimately produce a fixed flexor posture. Furthermore, reduction of flexor spasms by elimination of nociceptive stimuli (infected bladder, decubitus, etc.) favors an extensor posture of the legs (paraplegia in extension). According to Guttmann, the positioning of the limbs during the early stages of paraplegia influences their ultimate posture. Thus, prolonged fixation of"

A meningioma of the foramen magnum, for example, may begin with spastic weakness of one limb, followed by sequential involvement of the other limbs in the above noted \u201caround-the-clock\u201d pattern. There are usually bilateral Babinski signs early in the process, but there may be few sensory findings. We have also seen this pattern in patients with multiple sclerosis and other intrinsic inflammatory and neoplastic lesions.

If hemispheric signs are present, a parasagittal meningioma or chronic hydrocephalus is likely. The absence of spasticity in a long-standing paraparesis suggests a lower motor neuron or myopathic etiology."

The gene mutations found in some of the variant types were summarized by Fink, but\u2014as with all types of uncomplicated and complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia\u2014the mechanisms of neuronal loss are not known. To be separated from these cases are all the congenital nonprogressive types of spastic diplegia and athetosis. The following list includes the best-known entities: 1.

            "content": "The typical case begins insidiously in the fifth or sixth decade with a stiffness in one leg, then in the other; there is a slowing of gait, with spasticity predominating over weakness as the years go on. Walking is still possible with the help of a cane for many years after the onset, but eventually this condition acquires the characteristic features of a severe spastic paraparesis. Over the years, finger movements become slower, the arms become spastic, and, if the illness persists for decades, speech takes on a pseudobulbar lilt. There are no sensory symptoms or signs. The legs are often found to be surprisingly strong, the difficulty in locomotion being attributable to rigid spasticity. About half the patients eventually acquire spasticity of the bladder. Pringle and associates suggest that a diagnostic criterion of the disease is progression for 3 years without evidence of lower motor neuron dysfunction."

            "content": "From time to time we have observed children and young adults with unmistakable progressive spastic paraplegia superimposed on a sensorimotor polyneuropathy of extremely chronic evolution. Sural nerve biopsy in 2 of our cases disclosed a typical \u201chypertrophic\u201d polyneuropathy. In another case, only loss of nerve fibers was found. Cavanaugh and colleagues and Harding and Thomas (1984) reported similar patients. Our patients were severely disabled, being barely able to stand on their atrophic legs. An even more ambiguous form of disease was described by Vucic and colleagues in which there is typical CMT but with brisk reflexes. There were Babinski signs in half the patients and spastic dysphonia in a few others. The mutation is not known."
