If the urine test is positive, it helps direct specific enzyme measurement. If it is negative, it does not exclude a lysosomal storage disorder, and other testing modalities are needed if clinical signs are convincing. In disorders in which specific mutations are known, molecular testing refines the diagnosis. Specific diagnosis, carrier testing, and evaluation of at-risk family members require one of these approaches. Making a specific diagnosis is assuming increasing importance because specific treatment for some lysosomal disorders is very effective."

The diagnosis is confirmed by enzyme assay on cells or tissues from the patients or by DNA testing. The clinical manifestations in many of these conditions can be prevented or mitigated if a diagnosis is achieved early and appropriate treatment (e.g., dietary protein or amino acid restriction or vitamin supplementation) is instituted promptly. For this reason, newborn screening programs seek to identify several of these disorders. Infants with a positive screening test need additional metabolic testing (usually suggested by the newborn screening program) to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. Confirmed cases should be referred to a metabolic center for initiation of therapy. The parents need to be counseled about the recurrence"

Thus, the likelihood that a partner will be a gene carrier is small, unless there is consanguinity or the partner is a member of an at-risk group. Heterozygous carriers are usually undetectable clinically but may have biochemical test abnormalities that can be used for carrier screening. Other recessive conditions can be identified only by molecular genetic testing (Chap. 14, p. 288). Inborn Errors of Metabolism Most of these autosomal recessive diseases result from absence of a crucial enzyme, leading to incomplete metabolism of proteins, lipids, or carbohydrates.

For example, it is common to screen healthy pregnant women (and their partners) for mutations in the CFTR gene, which is mutated in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The goal of this screening is to identify women who are carriers of a CFTR mutation and therefore are at increased risk of having a baby with CF. Because CF is an autosomal recessive disorder, a fetus has a 1:4 chance of being affected if both parents are carriers of disease-causing CFTR mutations. The screening test approach that is commonly used to identify mutations in carriers detects 80\u201385% of all known disease-causing CFTR mutations in Caucasians and up to 97% of mutations among Ashkenazi Jews.

            "content": "At present, if patients have an elevated transferrin saturation or ferritin level, genetic testing should be performed; if they are a C282Y homozygote or a compound heterozygote (C282Y/H63D), the diagnosis is confirmed. If liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) are elevated or the ferritin is >1000 \u03bcg/L, the patient should be considered for liver biopsy because there is an increased frequency of advanced fibrosis in these individuals. If liver biopsy is performed, iron deposition is found in a periportal distribution with a periportal to pericentral gradient; iron is found predominantly in parenchymal cells, and Kupffer cells are spared.

            "content": "B. Excessive pancreatic secretion of insulin in CF commonly results in hypoglycemia. C. Genetic testing for CF may involve the use of a set of probes for the most common mutations, a technique known as restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. D. Some mutations result in premature degradation of the CFTR protein through tagging with ubiquinone followed by proteasome-mediated proteolysis. E. The most common mutation, \u2206F508, results in the loss of a codon for phenylalanine (F) and is classified as a frameshift mutation. Q2. The CFTR protein is an intrinsic plasma membrane glycoprotein. Targeting of proteins destined to function as components of membranes: A. includes transport to and through the Golgi. B. involves an amino-terminal signal sequence that is retained in the functional protein. C. occurs after the protein has been completely synthesized (that is, posttranslationally)."

            "content": "Laboratory Testing Diagnosis of liver disease is greatly aided by the availability of reliable and sensitive tests of liver injury and function. A typical battery of blood tests used for initial assessment of liver disease includes measurement of levels of serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, direct and total serum bilirubin and albumin, and prothrombin time. The pattern of abnormalities generally points to hepatocellular versus cholestatic liver disease and helps determine whether the disease is acute or chronic and whether cirrhosis and hepatic failure are present. On the basis of these results, further testing over time may be necessary. Other laboratory tests may be helpful, such as \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase to define whether alkaline phosphatase elevations are due to liver disease; hepatitis serology to define the type of viral hepatitis; and autoimmune markers to diagnose primary biliary cirrhosis (antimitochondrial antibody), scleros ing"
