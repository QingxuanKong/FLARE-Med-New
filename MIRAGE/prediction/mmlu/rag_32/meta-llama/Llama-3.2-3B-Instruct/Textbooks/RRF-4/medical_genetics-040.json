Let's evaluate each option: Option A, Alpha-thalassaemia, is a genetic disorder that affects the production of the alpha-globin chains of haemoglobin, leading to anaemia. However, it is not typically characterized by severe anaemia at birth. Option B, Beta-thalassaemia, is another genetic disorder affecting the production of the beta-globin chains of haemoglobin, leading to anaemia. Like Alpha-thalassaemia, it is not typically characterized by severe anaemia at birth. Option C, Hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin, is a condition where the fetal haemoglobin persists into adulthood. It is not typically associated with severe anaemia at birth. Option D, Sickle cell disease, is a genetic disorder affecting the production of the beta-globin chains of haemoglobin, leading to anaemia and other complications. Severe anaemia at birth is a feature of sickle cell disease, as the newborn's red blood cells are more prone to destruction, leading to anaemia. Based on the information, the correct answer is Option D, Sickle cell disease. answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Anemia is associated with several adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth (Kidanto, 2009; Kumar, 2013; Rukuni, 2016). Children born to iron-deicient women and without iron supplementation are reported to have lower mental development scores (Drassinower, 2016; Tran, 2014). A seemingly paradoxical inding is that healthy pregnant women with a higher hemoglobin concentration are also at greater risk for adverse perinatal outcomes (Murphy, 1986; von Tempelhof, 2008). This may result from lower than average plasma volume expansion of pregnancy concurrent with normal red cell mass accrual.

When other systemic manifestations occur, they can involve the central nervous system (sometimes entailing severe mental retardation, particularly in the case of triose phosphate isomerase deficiency), the neuromuscular system, or both.

In the third trimester, additional iron is needed to augment maternal hemoglobin and for transport to the fetus. Because the amount of iron diverted to the fetus is similar in a normal and in an iron-deicient mother, the newborn of a severely anemic mother does not sufer from irondeiciency anemia. Neonatal iron stores are related to maternal iron status and to timing of cord clamping. Classic morphological evidence of iron-deiciency anemia is erythrocyte hypochromia and microcytosis (Fig. 56-3). This may be less prominent in the pregnant woman. Serum ferritin levels are lower. And, levels of hepcidin-the master regulator of iron availability-are decreased normally in pregnancy. With iron deiciency, hepcidin levels follow those of serum ferritin (Camaschella, 2015; Koenig, 2014)."

Newborns whose mothers took anticonvulsant drugs are at higher risk because these suppress maternal hepatic synthesis of some of these factors. Classic hemorrhagic disease is usually apparent 2 to 5 days after birth in neonates not given vitamin K prophylaxis at delivery (Busield, 2013). Delayed hemorrhage may occur at 2 to 12 weeks in exclusively breastfed infants because breast milk contains little vitamin K.

Symptoms of anemia are also frequent, including lassitude, weakness, shortness of breath, and a pounding sensation in the ears. Infection is an unusual first symptom in aplastic anemia (unlike in agranulocytosis, where pharyngitis, anorectal infection, or frank sepsis occurs early).

Other disorders arise during pregnancy because of pregnancy-induced demands. Two examples are iron deiciency and megaloblastic anemias. Pregnancy may also unmask underlying hematological disorders. Finally, any hematological disease may irst arise during pregnancy.

            "content": "-J. Whitridge Williams (1903) Little was written of fetal disorders in the first edition of this textbook. General dropsy described above is today known as hydrops etalis (p. 309). Hydrops is perhaps the quintessential fetal disorder, as it can be a manifestation of severe illness from a wide variety of etiologies. Fetal disorders may be acquired-such as alloimmunization, they may be genetic-congenital adrenal hyperplasia or aA-thalassemia, or they may be sporadic developmental abnormalities-like many structural malformations. In this chapter, fetal anemia and thrombocytopenia as well as immune and nonimmune fetal hydrops are reviewed. Fetal structural malformations are reviewed in Chapter 10, genetic abnormalities in Chapters 13 and 14, and conditions amenable to medical and surgical fetal therapies in Chapter 16. Because congenital infections arise as a result of maternal infection or colonization, they are considered in Chapters 64 and 65."

The platelet count is routinely measured in women with any form of gestational hypertension. Decreased platelet concentra tions with eclampsia were described more than 100 years ago."

            "content": "he most fulminant acquired hemolytic anemia encountered during pregnancy is caused by the exotoxin of Clostridium petingens or by group A J-hemolytic streptococcus (Chap. 47, p. 922). Endotoxin of gram-negative bacteria, that is, lipopolysaccharide, may be accompanied by hemolysis and mild-to-moderate anemia (Cox, 1991). For example, anemia often accompanies acute pyelonephritis. With normal erythropoietin production, red cell mass is restored following infection resolution as pregnancy progresses (Cavenee, 1994; Dotters-Katz, 2013)."

            "content": "Hemoglobin H disease (34) results from the compound heterozygous state for .0_ plus .+-thalassemia with deletion of three of four alpha genes (--I-x). With only one functional a-globin gene per diploid genome, the newborn will have abnormal red cells containing a mixture of hemoglobin Bart (14), hemoglobin H (34)' and hemoglobin A. The neonate appears normal but soon develops hemolytic anemia as most of the hemoglobin Bart is replaced by hemoglobin H. In adults, anemia is moderate to severe and usually worsens during pregnancy. Inheritance of all four abnormal a genes causes homozygous a-thalassemia with predominant production of hemoglobin Bart, which has an appreciably increased ainity for oxygen. This is incompatible with extended survival. Hsieh and colleagues (1989) reported that blood obtained by funipuncture from 20 hydropic fetuses contained 65 to 98 percent Bart hemoglobin. These fetuses are stillborn, or they are hydropic and usually die very soon after birth."

It is a small, single-stranded DNA virus that replicates in rapidly proliferating cells such as erythroblast precursors (Brown, 2015). his can lead to anemia, which is its primary fetal efect. Only individuals with the erythrocyte globoside membrane P antigen are susceptible. In women with severe hemolytic anemia-for example, sickle-cell disease-parvovirus infection may cause an aplastic crisis."
