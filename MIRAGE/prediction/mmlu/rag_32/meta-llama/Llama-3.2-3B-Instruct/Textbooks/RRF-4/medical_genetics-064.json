Autosomal dominant (A) inheritance pattern: In this pattern, a single copy of the dominant allele is enough to cause the trait. Both males and females have an equal chance of expressing the trait. However, male-to-male transmission is not a key feature of autosomal dominant inheritance. Autosomal recessive (B) inheritance pattern: In this pattern, two copies of the recessive allele are needed to cause the trait. Carriers of the recessive allele have no symptoms, but they can pass the allele to their offspring. Male-to-male transmission is not a key feature of autosomal recessive inheritance. X-linked dominant (C) inheritance pattern: In this pattern, a single copy of the dominant allele on the X chromosome is enough to cause the trait. Females have two X chromosomes, so they can be either homozygous or heterozygous for the dominant allele. However, male-to-male transmission is not a key feature of X-linked dominant inheritance. X-linked recessive (D) inheritance pattern: In this pattern, two copies of the recessive allele are needed to cause the trait. Males have only one X chromosome, so if they inherit the recessive allele, they will express the trait. Female carriers of the recessive allele have a 50% chance of passing the allele to their sons, who will express the trait, and a 50% chance of passing the allele to their daughters, who will be carriers like their mother. Male-to-male transmission is a key feature of X-linked recessive inheritance, as sons of an affected father will always inherit the recessive allele from their father and express the trait. Therefore, the correct answer is D. X-linked recessive inheritance pattern.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

A son inherits the Y chromosome from his father and one maternal X chromosome. Thus, the characteristic features of X-linked inheritance are (1) the absence of father-to-son transmission, and (2) the fact that all daughters of an affected male are obligate carriers of the mutant allele (Fig. 82-13C). The risk of developing disease due to a mutant X-chromosomal gene differs in the two sexes. Because males have only one X chromosome, they are hemizygous for the mutant allele; thus, they are more likely to develop the mutant phenotype, regardless of whether the mutation is dominant or recessive. A female may be either heterozygous or homozygous for the mutant allele, which may be dominant or recessive. The terms X-linked dominant or X-linked recessive are therefore only applicable to expression of the mutant"

It should be recognized, however, that some individuals acquire a mutated gene from an unaffected parent. De novo germline mutations occur more frequently during later cell divisions in gametogenesis, which explains why siblings are rarely affected. As noted before, new germline mutations occur more frequently in fathers of advanced age. For example, the average age of fathers with new germline mutations that cause Marfan\u2019s syndrome is ~37 years, whereas fathers who transmit the disease by inheritance have an average age of ~30 years."

These so-called \u201cfull mutations\u201d are believed to arise through an intermediate stage of premutations characterized by 52 to 200 CGG repeats. Carrier males and females have premutations. During oogenesis (but not spermatogenesis), the premutations can be converted to full mutations by further amplification of the CGG repeats, which can then be transmitted to both the sons and the daughters of the carrier female.

One complete set of nuclear genes is inherited from the father and one complete set is inherited from the mother. Underlying this law is the accurate parceling out of chromosomes to the germ cells (eggs and sperm) that takes place during meiosis. Thus, when a diploid cell in a parent undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid germ cells, exactly half of the genes distributed among these four cells should be maternal (genes inherited from the mother of this parent) and the other half paternal (genes inherited from the father of this parent). In some organisms (fungi, for example), it is possible to recover and analyze all four of the haploid gametes produced from a single cell by meiosis. Studies in such organisms have revealed rare cases in which the parceling out of genes"

            "content": "Certain threshold traits have a clear male or female predominance. If an individual of the less common gender has the characteristic or defect, the recurrence risk is greater in his or her ofspring (Fig. 13-10). An example is pyloric stenosis, which is approximately four times more common in males (Krogh, 2012). A female with pyloric stenosis has likely inherited more predisposing genetic factors than are necessary to produce the defect in a male, and the recurrence risk for her children or siblings is thus higher than the expected 3 to 5 percent. Her male siblings or male ofspring would have the highest liability because they not only will inherit more than the usual number of predisposing genes but also are the more susceptible gender."

            "content": "The egg-polarity genes have a further special feature: they are all maternal-effect genes, in that it is the mother\u2019s genome rather than the zygote\u2019s genome that is critical. For example, a fly whose chromosomes are mutant in both copies of the Bicoid gene but who is born from a mother carrying one normal copy of Bicoid develops perfectly normally, without any defects in the head pattern. However, if that offspring is a female, she cannot deposit any functional Bicoid mRNA into her own eggs, which will therefore develop into headless embryos, regardless of the father\u2019s genotype. The egg-polarity genes act first in a hierarchy of gene systems that define a progressively more detailed pattern of body parts. In the next few pages, we begin with the molecular mechanisms that pattern the developing Drosophila embryo and larva along the A-P axis, before considering the patterning along the D-V axis."
