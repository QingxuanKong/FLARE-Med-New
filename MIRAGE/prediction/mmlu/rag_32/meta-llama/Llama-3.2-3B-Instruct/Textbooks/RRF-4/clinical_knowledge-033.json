Calcitonin, a hormone produced by the thyroid gland, actually lowers blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclast activity and increasing calcium excretion by the kidneys. This is contrary to what is stated in document [18] (Title: First_Aid_Step1) which mentions that calcitonin opposes the actions of PTH and tones down serum calcium levels.\\n\\nOption B: Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic - This statement is incorrect. Primary hyperparathyroidism can be asymptomatic, but it often presents with symptoms such as bone pain, kidney stones, and neuromuscular symptoms due to hypercalcemia. This is mentioned in document [14] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison).\\n\\nOption C: Vitamin D is secreted by the parathyroid glands - This statement is incorrect. Vitamin D is actually produced in the skin upon exposure to sunlight and is then hydroxylated in the liver and kidneys to form the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The parathyroid glands do play a role in regulating calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone (PTH), but they do not produce vitamin D. This is mentioned in document [24] (Title: Physiology_Levy).\\n\\nOption D: Oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia - This statement is correct. Oliguria, or decreased urine production, can be a symptom of hypercalcemia due to the vasoconstrictive effects of high calcium levels on the kidneys.

Intestinal absorption of ingested calcium involves both active (transcellular) and passive (paracellular) mechanisms. Passive calcium absorption is nonsaturable and approximates 5% of daily calcium intake, whereas active absorption involves apical calcium entry via specific ion channels (TRPV5 and TRPV6), whose expression is controlled principally by 1,25(OH)2D, and normally ranges from 20 to 70%. Active calcium transport occurs mainly in the proximal small bowel (duodenum and proximal jejunum), although some active calcium absorption occurs in most segments of the small intestine.

            "content": "Although free-water clearance is controlled primarily by vasopressin, cortisol and thyroid hormone are also important for facilitating renal tubular responses to vasopressin (Chap. 404). PTH and vitamin D function in an interdependent manner to control calcium metabolism (Chap. 423). PTH stimulates renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which increases calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and enhances PTH action in bone. Increased calcium, along with vitamin D, feeds back to suppress PTH, thus maintaining calcium balance."

            "content": "Cellular processes in which Ca++ plays an important role include bone formation, cell division and growth, blood coagulation, hormone-response coupling, and electrical stimulus-response coupling (e.g., muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release). Nearly 99% of Ca++ is stored in bone and teeth, approximately 1% is found in ICF, and 0.1% in ECF. The total Ca++ concentration ([Ca++]) in plasma is 10 mg/dL (2.5 mM or 5 mEq/L), and its concentration is normally maintained within very narrow limits. Approximately 50% of the Ca++ in plasma is ionized, 40% is bound to plasma proteins (mainly albumin), and 10% is complexed to several anions, including Pi, HCO3 \u2212 , citrate, and SO42\u2212 (Fig. 36.11 ). The pH of plasma influences this distribution ( Fig. 36.12). Acidemia increases the"

            "content": "Hypoglycemia is characterized by low blood glucose accompanied by adrenergic and neuroglycopenic symptoms that are rapidly resolved by the administration of glucose. Insulin-induced, postprandial, and fasting hypoglycemia result in release of glucagon and epinephrine. The rise in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) that accompanies ethanol metabolism inhibits gluconeogenesis, leading to hypoglycemia in individuals with depleted stores. Alcohol consumption also increases the risk for hypoglycemia in patients using insulin. Chronic alcohol consumption can cause fatty liver disease. Choose the ONE best answer. 3.1. Which of the following statements is true for insulin but not for glucagon? A. It is a peptide hormone secreted by pancreatic cells. B. Its actions are mediated by binding to a receptor found on the cell membrane of liver cells. C. Its effects include alterations in gene expression. D. Its secretion is decreased by the catecholamines."

Clinical manifestations include recurrent infections as a consequence of a deficiency in T cells. Which one of the following is an expected clinical consequence of the deficiency in parathyroid hormone? A. Increased bone resorption B. Increased calcium reabsorption in the kidney C. Increased serum calcitriol D. Increased serum phosphate Correct answer = D. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases bone resorption (demineralization) resulting in the release of calcium and phosphate. It also increases the renal reabsorption of calcium, because PTH activates the renal hydroxylase that converts calcidiol to calcitriol. PTH also increases the renal excretion of phosphate. With the hypoparathyroidism of DiGeorge syndrome, all of these activities of PTH are impaired. Consequently, hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia are seen."
