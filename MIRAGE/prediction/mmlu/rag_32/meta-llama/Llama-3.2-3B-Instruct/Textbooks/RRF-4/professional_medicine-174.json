    "question": "A 5-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents for evaluation of recurrent injuries. Her parents say that she started walking at the age of 14 months and since then has always seemed clumsier and had more injuries than other children. She has had increasingly frequent chest pain with exertion since starting a soccer program 3 months ago. She usually has pain or swelling of her knees or ankles after practice. She has been wearing glasses for 2 years. Her 16-year-old brother has required two operations for a severe rotator cuff injury he sustained while taking a shower, and she has a maternal cousin who died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 26 years. Today, the patient walks with a limp. She is at the 99th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. A midsystolic click is heard at the apex. The left ankle is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. The joints of the upper and lower extremities are hypermobile, including 25 degrees of genu recurvatum, thumbs that may be extended to touch the forearms, and flexibility at the waist, with palms easily touching the floor with straight knees. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",

The patient's physical examination findings, such as the midsystolic click, joint hypermobility, and skeletal abnormalities (e.g., genu recurvatum, thumbs that may be extended to touch the forearms), are also consistent with Marfan syndrome. A skeletal survey is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis to assess for any skeletal abnormalities, such as pseudotumor peronei or other skeletal defects that are commonly seen in Marfan syndrome. Echocardiography may also be indicated to evaluate the heart, which is often affected in Marfan syndrome. However, it is not the most immediate next step. Bone scan and MRI of the shoulder may also be useful, but they are not the first line of investigation. Given the clinical presentation and family history, a skeletal survey is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Contractures of the heel cords and iliotibial bands become apparent by age 6 years, when toe walking is associated with a lordotic posture. Loss of muscle strength is progressive, with predilection for proximal limb muscles and the neck flexors; leg involvement is more severe than arm involvement. Between ages 8 and 10 years, walking may require the use of braces; joint contractures and limitations of hip flexion, knee, elbow, and wrist extension are made worse by prolonged sitting.

Irritation of the obturator nerve can cause referred pain in the thigh and knee when the pathology is at the hip. Patients with transient synovitis are often afebrile, walk with a painful limp, and have normal to minimally elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate compared with bacterial diseases of the hip (Table 199-1). Table 197-3 lists the differential diagnosis of a limping child. Anteroposterior and frog-leg radiographs of the hip are usually normal. Ultrasonography may reveal a joint effusion.

Popliteal artery entrapment typically affects young athletic men and women when the gastrocnemius or popliteus muscle compresses the popliteal artery and causes intermittent claudication. Thrombosis, 1647 embolism, or popliteal artery aneurysm may occur. The pulse examination may be normal unless provocative maneuvers such as ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion are performed. The diagnosis is confirmed by duplex ultrasound, CTA, MRA, or conventional angiography. Treatment involves surgical release of the popliteal artery or vascular reconstruction."

            "content": "The clinical picture is that of a gradual development of spastic weakness of the legs with increasing difficulty in walking. The tendon reflexes are hyperactive and the plantar reflexes extensor. In the pure form of the disease, sensory and other nervous functions are entirely intact. If the onset is in childhood, as many cases are, the foot arches become exaggerated, the feet are shortened, and there is a tightening (pseudocontracture) of calf muscles, forcing the child or adolescent to \u201ctoe-walk.\u201d This is a common orthopedic problem and may require surgical correction. In children, the legs appear to be underdeveloped, and in both children and adults they may become quite thin. Sometimes the knees are slightly flexed; at other times the legs are fully extended or hyperextended (genu recurvatum) and adducted. Weakness is variable and difficult to estimate. Sphincteric function is usually retained. Subtle sensory loss in the feet has been reported. The arms are variably involved. In"

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

            "content": "The presentation is variable, based on severity and type of slip. Patients will often report hip or knee pain, limp or inability to ambulate, and decreased hip range of motion. There may or may not be a traumatic event. Any knee pain mandates an examination of the hip, as hip pathology can cause referred pain to the anterior thigh and knee along the obturator nerve. The patient usually holds the affected extremity in external rotation. As the hip is flexed, it will progressively externally rotate. There is usually a limitation of internal rotation, but there may also be a loss of flexion and abduction. If the patient can bear weight, it is typically an antalgic gait with the affected leg in external rotation. It is important to examine both hips to determine bilateral involvement."

These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight.

During the year before presentation, her scholastic performance in school deteriorated, she gained 25 lb, she became increasingly lethargic, and nocturia and polydypsia were noted. Initial evaluation documented low follicle-stimulating hormone, elevated prolactin, and a bone age of 10.5 years. Computed tomography scanning documented a large hypothalamic neoplasm that proved to be an ectopic germinoma. The patient was also documented to be hypothyroid and hypoadrenal and to have diabetes insipidus. Despite the elevated prolactin, she had no galactorrhea because of the minimal breast development.
