Psoriatic arthropathy can occur without skin manifestations, and the presence of arthritis is a key criterion for diagnosis.\\n\\nOption B: There is no specific blood marker that can confirm the diagnosis of psoriatic arthropathy. While some blood tests may be elevated in patients with psoriatic arthropathy, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), these are not specific to this condition.\\n\\nOption C: Tophi can be associated with psoriatic arthritis, particularly in the context of psoriatic arthritis mutilans. However, this is not a universal feature of psoriatic arthropathy.\\n\\nOption D: Nail pitting is a common feature of psoriatic arthropathy, particularly in the distal interphalangeal joints.

In about 15\u201320% of cases, the arthritis precedes the onset of psoriasis and can present a diagnostic challenge. The frequency in men and women is almost equal, although the frequency of disease patterns differs somewhat in the two sexes. The disease can begin in childhood or late in life but typically begins in the fourth or fifth decade, at an average age of 37 years. The spectrum of arthropathy associated with psoriasis is quite broad. Many classification schemes have been proposed. In the original scheme of Wright and Moll, five patterns are described: (1) arthritis of the DIP joints; (2) asymmetric oligoarthritis; (3) symmetric polyarthritis similar to RA; (4) axial involvement (spine and sacroiliac joints); and (5) arthritis mutilans, a highly destructive form of FIGUrE 384-3 Characteristic lesions of psoriatic arthritis."

The association between arthritis and psoriasis was noted in the nineteenth century. In the 1960s, on the basis of epidemiologic and clinical studies, it became clear that unlike RA, the arthritis associated with psoriasis was usually seronegative, often involved the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of the fingers and the spine and sacroiliac joints, had distinctive radiographic features, and showed considerable familial aggregation. In the 1970s, PsA was included in the broader category of the spondyloarthritides because of features similar to those of AS and ReA."

Many of the responding patients had long-standing disease that was resistant to all previous therapy, as well as extensive skin disease. The clinical response is often more dramatic than in RA, and delay of disease progression has been demonstrated radiographically. The potential additive effect of methotrexate to anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents in PsA remains uncertain.

            "content": "An increased risk of metabolic syndrome, including increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular events, has been demonstrated in psoriasis patients. Appropriate screening tests should be performed. The etiology of psoriasis is still poorly understood, but there is clearly a genetic component to the disease. In various studies, 30\u201350% of patients with psoriasis report a positive family history. Psoriatic lesions contain infiltrates of activated T cells that are thought to elaborate cytokines responsible for keratinocyte hyperproliferation, which results in the characteristic clinical findings. Agents inhibiting T cell activation, clonal expansion, or release of proinflammatory cytokines are often effective for the treatment of severe psoriasis (see below)."

            "content": "Seronegative Arthropathies (See also Chap. 384) The seronegative arthropathies, including ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and the arthritides associated with ulcerative colitis and regional enteritis, are all strongly associated with the HLA-B27 histocompatibility antigen and may be accompanied by a pancarditis and proximal aortitis. The aortic inflammation usually is limited to the aortic root but may extend to involve the aortic valve, mitral valve, and ventricular myocardium, resulting in aortic and mitral regurgitation, conduction abnormalities, and ventricular dysfunction. One-tenth of these patients have significant aortic insufficiency, and one-third have conduction disturbances; both are more common in patients with peripheral joint involvement and long-standing disease. Treatment with aortic valve replacement and permanent pacemaker implantation may be required. Occasionally, aortic regurgitation precedes the onset of arthritis, and therefore,"

Synovial histology is similar to that of other SpAs. Enthesitis shows increased vascularity and macrophage infiltration of fibrocartilage. Microscopic histopathologic evidence of inflammation mimicking IBD has routinely been demonstrated in the colon and ileum of patients withpostentericReAand lesscommonly inpostvenereal ReA. The skin lesions of keratoderma blennorrhagica, associated mainly withvenereallyacquired ReA,arehistologically indistinguishable from pustular psoriatic lesions."

            "content": "Psoriasis most frequently affects the skin of the elbows, knees, scalp, lumbosacral areas, intergluteal cleft, glans penis, and vulva. Nail changes on the fingers and toes occur in 30% of cases. In most cases psoriasis is limited in distribution, but it can be widespread and severe. The clinical subtypes are defined by pattern of involvement and severity. Treatment is aimed at preventing the release or actions of inflammatory mediators. Mild disease is treated topically with ointments containing corticosteroids or other immunomodulatory agents, whereas more severe disease is treated with phototherapy (which has immunosuppressive effects) or systemic therapy with immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate or TNF antagonists. http://ebooksmedicine.net"
