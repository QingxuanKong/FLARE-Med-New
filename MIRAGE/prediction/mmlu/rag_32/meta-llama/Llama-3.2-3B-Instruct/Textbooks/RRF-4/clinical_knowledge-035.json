According to the provided documents, the normal respiratory rate for an adult male is not explicitly stated. However, we can look at the provided options and the general knowledge about respiratory rates for adults. The normal respiratory rate for adults is typically around 12-20 breaths per minute. Options A (10-12 breaths per minute) and B (8-10 breaths per minute) are on the lower end of this range, while options C (20-22 breaths per minute) and D (14-16 breaths per minute) are on the higher end. Given the normal range, we can eliminate options A and B. Between options C and D, the average of the range is closer to the typical normal respiratory rate for an adult male. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D. 14-16 breaths per minute.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Newborn resting heart rates are approximately 120 beats/minute, slightly higher in infants 3 to 6 months of age and then gradually declining through adolescence to near 80 beats/minute. The range of normal for any given age is approximately 30 beats/minute above or below the average. Tachycardia may be a manifestation of anemia, dehydration, shock, heart failure, or dysrhythmia. Bradycardia can be a normal finding in patients with high vagal tone (athletes), but may be a manifestation of atrioventricular block. The respiratory rate of infants is best assessed while the infant is quiet. Respiratory rate may be increased when there is a left-to-right shunt or pulmonary venous congestion."

In contrast, the alveoli at the apex are represented closer to the top or flat portion of the pressure-volume curve. They have lower compliance and thus receive proportionately less of the tidal volume. The effect of gravity is less pronounced when a person is supine rather than upright, and it is less pressure-volume curve). Alveolar units with long time constants fill and empty slowly. Thus an alveolar unit with increased airway resistance or increased compliance takes longer to fill and longer to empty. In adults, the normal respiratory rate is approximately 12 breaths per minute, the inspiratory time is approximately 2 seconds, and the expiratory time is approximately 3 seconds. In normal lungs, this time is sufficient to approach volume equilibrium ("

As discussed below, the rate of ventilation is primarily set by the need to eliminate carbon dioxide, and thus ventilation increases during exercise (sometimes by more than twentyfold) and during metabolic acidosis as a compensatory response. Naturally, the work rate required to overcome the elasticity of the respiratory system increases with both the depth and the frequency of tidal breaths, while the work required to overcome the dynamic load increases with total ventilation. A modest increase of ventilation is most efficiently achieved by increasing tidal volume but not respiratory rate, which is the normal ventilatory response to lower-level exercise. At high levels of exercise, deep breathing persists, but respiratory rate also increases. The pattern chosen by the respiratory controller minimizes the"

It reflects the substrate being oxidized for energy (Fig. 27.6).] RMR also can be estimated using equations that include sex and age (RMR reflects lean muscle mass, which is highest in men and the young) as well as height and weight. A commonly used rough estimate is 1 kcal/kg/hour for men and 0.9 kcal/kg/hour for women.

Although the growth rate of the lung slows after adolescence, the body and lung increase in size steadily until adulthood. Improvement in lung function occurs at all stages of growth development; however, once optimal size has been attained in early adulthood (20 to 25 years of age), lung function starts to decline with age. The decrease in lung function with age, estimated at less than 1% per year, appears to begin earlier and proceed faster in individuals who smoke or are exposed to toxic environmental factors.

During sleep, the heart rate decreases by 10 to 20 beats per minute. It may increase during emotional excitement, and during muscular exercise, it may increase to rates well above 150 beats per minute. In well-trained athletes, the usual resting rate is only approximately 50 beats per minute. Both divisions of the autonomic nervous system tonically influence the cardiac pacemaker, which is normally the sinoatrial (SA) node. The sympathetic nervous system enhances automaticity, whereas the parasympathetic nervous system inhibits it. Changes in heart rate usually involve a reciprocal action of these two divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Thus the heart rate ordinarily increases with a combined decrease in parasympathetic activity and increase in sympathetic activity; the heart rate decreases with the opposite changes in autonomic neural activity."

At this volume (called the functional residual capacity [FRC]), the outward recoil of the chest wall is balanced exactly by the inward recoil of the lung. As these recoils are transmitted through the pleural fluid, the lung is pulled both outward and inward simultaneously at FRC, and thus its pressure falls below atmospheric pressure (typically, \u22125 cmH2O)."

The respiratory control center is located in the medulla oblongata of the brainstem and is composed of multiple nuclei that generate and modify the basic ventilatory rhythm. This center consists of two main parts: (1) a ventilatory pattern generator, which sets the rhythmic pattern, and (2) an integrator, which controls generation of the pattern, processes input from higher brain centers and chemoreceptors, and controls the rate and amplitude of the ventilatory pattern. Input to the integrator arises from higher brain centers, including the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, limbic system including the amygdalae, and cerebellum."

The volume of air that is exhaled in the first second during the maneuver is called the FEV1. In normal individuals, 70% to 85% (depending on age) of the FVC can be exhaled in the first second. Thus the normal FEV1/FVC ratio is greater than 70% in healthy adults.

Adults with COPD have a very long time constant as a result when a person is supine rather than prone. This is because the diaphragm is pushed in a cephalad direction when a person is supine, and it affects the size of all of the alveoli. In addition to gravitational effects on the distribution of ventilation, ventilation in alveoli is not uniform. The reason for this is variable airway resistance (R) or compliance (C), and it is described quantitatively by the time constant (\u03c4):"

All lung volumes are subdivisions of total lung capacity (TLC), the total volume of air that is contained in the lung at the point of maximal inspiration. Lung volumes are reported in liters either as volumes or as capacities. A capacity is composed of two or more volumes. Many lung volumes are measured with a spirometer. The patient is asked to first breathe normally into the spirometer, and the volume of air (the tidal volume [VT]) that is moved into and out of the lungs with each quiet breath is measured. The patient then inhales maximally and exhales forcefully and completely, and the volume of exhaled air is measured. The total volume of exhaled air, from a maximal inspiration to a maximal exhalation, is the vital capacity (VC). Residual volume (RV) is the air remaining in the lungs after a complete exhalation. TLC is the sum of VC and RV; it is the total volume of air contained in the lungs at the end of maximal inspiration,"
