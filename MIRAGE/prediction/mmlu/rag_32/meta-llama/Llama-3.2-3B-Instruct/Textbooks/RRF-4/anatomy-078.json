Specifically, Document [0] mentions the reabsorption of potassium and calcium by the distal tubule, while Document [1] lists potassium as one of the major minerals. Additionally, Document [5] discusses the role of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in regulating calcium levels, and Document [10] defines macrominerals, which includes calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, chloride, and potassium. This suggests that calcium, potassium, and sodium are all classified as electrolytes.

Because the equilibrium potential for calcium, like sodium, is very positive, these channels generate a depolarizing inward current. Cardiac calcium channels activate and inactivate in what appears to be a manner similar to sodium channels, but in the case of the most common type of calcium channel (the \u201cL\u201d type), the transitions occur more slowly and at more positive potentials. After activation, these channels eventually inactivate and the permeability to potassium begins to increase, leading to final repolarization (phase 3) of the action potential.

Phases 0\u20134 are the rapid upstroke, early repolarization, plateau, late repolarization, and diastole, respectively. The ionic currents and their respective genes are shown above and below the action potentials. The currents that underlie the action potentials vary in atrial and ventricular myocytes. B. A ventricular action potential with a schematic of the ionic currents flowing during the phases of the action potential. Potassium current (IK1) is the principal current during phase 4 and determines the resting membrane potential of the myocyte. Sodium current generates the upstroke of the action potential (phase 0); activation of Ito with inactivation of the Na current inscribes early repolarization (phase 1). The plateau (phase 2) is generated by a balance of repolarizing potassium currents and depolarizing calcium current. Inactivation of the calcium current with persistent activation of potassium currents"

            "content": "The kidneys are the principal regulator of potassium balance, adjusting excretion based on intake. Factors affecting renal potassium excretion include aldosterone, acid-base status, serum potassium concentration, and renal function. The intracellular potassium concentration is approximately 30 times the extracellular potassium concentration. A variety of conditions alter the distribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments, potentially causing either hypokalemia or hyperkalemia. The plasma concentration does not always reflect the total body potassium content. Available @ StudentConsult.com"

            "content": "Intravenous phosphate administration is probably the fastest and surest way to reduce serum calcium, but it is a hazardous procedure if not done properly. Intravenous phosphate should be used only after other methods of treatment (bisphosphonates, calcitonin, and saline diuresis) have failed to control symptomatic hypercalcemia. Phosphate must be given slowly (50 mmol or 1.5 g elemental phosphorus over 6\u20138 hours) and the patient switched to oral phosphate (1\u20132 g/d elemental phosphorus, as one of the salts indicated below) as soon as symptoms of hypercalcemia have cleared. The risks of intravenous phosphate therapy include sudden hypocalcemia, ectopic calcification, acute renal failure, and hypotension. Oral phosphate can also lead to ectopic calcification and renal failure if serum calcium and phosphate levels are not carefully monitored, but the risk is less and the time of onset much longer. Phosphate is available in oral and intravenous forms as sodium or potassium salts. Amounts"

KOEPPEN AND BRUCE A. STANTON Upon completion of this chapter, the student should be able to answer the following questions: 1. What organelles are found in a typical eukaryotic cell, and what is their function? 2. What is the composition of the plasma membrane? 3. What are the major classes of membrane transport proteins, and how do they transport biologically important molecules and ions across the plasma membrane? 4. What is the electrochemical gradient, and how it is used to determine whether the transport of a molecule or ion across the plasma membrane is active or passive? 5. What are the driving forces for movement of water across cell membrane and the capillary wall?"
