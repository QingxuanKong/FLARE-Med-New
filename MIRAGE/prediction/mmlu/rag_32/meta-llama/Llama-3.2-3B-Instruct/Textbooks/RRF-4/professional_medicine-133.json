The cervix is 7 cm dilated and 100% effaced, which is consistent with the latent phase of labor.\\n3.

In women whose labors do not progress, an intrauterine pressure catheter is placed to assess uterine function.

Two of its components-amniotomy and oxytocinhave been widely used, especially in English-speaking countries outside the United States. With this protocol, labor is diagnosed when painful contractions are accompanied by complete cervical efacement, bloody \"show,\" or ruptured membranes. Women with such indings are committed to delivery within 12 hours. Pelvic examination is performed each hour for the next 3 hours, and thereafter at 2-hour intervals. When dilation has not increased by at least 1 cm/hr, amniotomy is performed. Progress is again assessed at 2 hours, and high-dose oxytocin infusion, described in Chapter 26 (p. 509),"

A woman is not encouraged to push beyond the completion of each contraction. Instead, she and her fetus are allowed to rest and recover. During this period of actively bearing down, the fetal heart rate auscultated during the contraction is likely to be slow but should recover to normal range before the next expulsive efort.

            "content": "During the first stage of labor, the need for subsequent vaginal examinations to monitor cervical change and present ing part position will vary considerably. When the membranes rupture, an examination to exclude cord prolapse is performed expeditiously if the fetal head was not deinitely engaged at the previous examination. he fetal heart rate is also checked immediately and during the next uterine contraction to help detect occult umbilical cord compression. At Parkland Hos pital, periodic pelvic examinations are typically performed at 2-to 3-hour intervals to evaluate labor progress. Evidence implicating the number of vaginal examinations in infection related morbidity is conlicting (Cahill, 2012; Soper, 1989)."

However, if severe, the condition is a common reason for cepha lopelvic disproportion even with an otherwise normal-sized pelvis. Successive fetal head shiting from posterior to anterior asynclitism aids descent. This movement is the first reqUISIte for birth of the newborn. In nulliparas, engagement may take place before the onset oflabor, and further descent may not follow until the onset of the second stage. In multiparas, descent usually begins with engagement. Descent is brought about by one or more of four forces: (1) pressure of the amnionic fluid, (2) direct pressure of the fundus upon the breech with contractions, (3) bearing-down eforts of maternal abdominal muscles, and (4) extension and straightening of the fetal body. 1.Head floating, before engagement 5.Complete extension 2.Engagement, descent, flexion 6.Restitution (external rotation) 3.Further descent, internal rotation 7.Delivery of anterior shoulder"

            "content": "Mechanism of Labor Spontaneous delivery of a fully developed newborn is impossible with a persistent transverse lie. After rupture of the membranes, if labor continues, the fetal shoulder is forced into the pelvis, and the corresponding arm frequently prolapses (Fig. 23-10). After some descent, the shoulder is arrested by the margins of the pelvic inlet. As labor continues, the shoulder is impacted irmly in the upper part of the pelvis. he uterus then contracts vigorously in an unsuccessful attempt to overcome the obstacle. With time, a retraction ring rises increasingly higher and becomes more marked. With this neglected transverse lie, the uterus will eventually rupture. Even without this complication, morbidity is increased because of the frequent association"

Strong contractions are associ-ated with true labor and should prompt consideration of delivery and resuscitation of the neonate. Focused prenatal history-taking should elicit a history of pregnancy-induced hypertension, ges-tational diabetes, congenital heart disease, preterm labor, or placental abnormalities. Asking the patient when the baby first moved and if she is currently experiencing movement of the fetus is important. Determining fetal age is key for consider-ations of viability. Gestational age may be estimated by noting fundal height, with the fundus approximating the umbilicus at 20 weeks and the costal margin at 40 weeks. Discrepancy in dates and size may be due to uterine rupture or hemorrhage.Initial evaluation for abdominopelvic trauma in pregnant patients should proceed in the standard manner. Ultrasound (FAST)"

But, the term originated at a time when the main indication for cesarean delivery was overt pelvic contracture due to rickets (0lah, 1994). Such absolute disproportion is now rare, and most cases result from malposition of the fetal head within the pelvis (asynclitism) or from inefective uterine contractions. True disproportion is a tenuous diagnosis because many women who undergo cesarean delivery for this reason subsequently deliver even larger newborns vaginally in subsequent pregnancies. A second phrase, ailure to progress in either spontaneous or stimulated labor, has become an increasingly popular description of inefectual labor. his term reflects lack of progressive cervical dilation or lack of fetal"

            "content": "Early diferentiation between true and false labor is diicultespecially before demonstrable cervical efacement and dilation. Uterine activity alone can be misleading because of Braxton Hicks contractions. These irregular, nonrhythmical contractions can cause considerable confusion in the diagnosis of true labor. Not infrequently, women who deliver before term have uterine activity that is attributed to Braxton Hicks contractions that prompt an incorrect diagnosis of false labor. Accordingly, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2016b) defines preterm labor to be regular contractions before 37 weeks that are associated with cervical change. In addition to contractions, pelvic pressure, menstrual-like cramps, watery vaginal discharge, and lower back pain have been empirically associated with impending preterm birth. Such complaints are thought by some to be common in normal pregnancy and are therefore often minimized by patients and obstetrical care providers."
