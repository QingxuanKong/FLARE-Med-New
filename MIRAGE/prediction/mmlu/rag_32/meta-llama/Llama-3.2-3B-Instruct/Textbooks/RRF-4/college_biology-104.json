The key piece of information is that it is thermophilic and methanogenic, and has isoprenylglycerol ethers in its membrane instead of phospholipids. Thermophilic prokaryotes are typically found in hot environments, such as hot springs or deep-sea vents. Methanogenic prokaryotes are able to produce methane gas as a byproduct of their metabolism. Isoprenylglycerol ethers are a type of lipid found in some prokaryotic membranes, particularly in thermophilic archaea. This suggests that the prokaryote in question is likely an archaeon, rather than a bacterium. The other options are not consistent with the characteristics described. Proteobacteria are a class of Gram-negative bacteria, spirochetes are a type of bacteria that have a spiral shape, and Chlamydia is a genus of bacteria that are obligate intracellular pathogens. Therefore, the correct answer is D. an archaeon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Like fatty acids (FA), phospholipids are amphipathic in nature. That is, each has a hydrophilic head, which is the phosphate group plus whatever alcohol is attached to it (for example, serine, ethanolamine, and choline; highlighted in blue in Fig. 17.1A), and a long, hydrophobic tail containing FA or FA-derived hydrocarbons (shown in orange in Fig. 17.1A). Phospholipids are the predominant lipids of cell membranes. In membranes, the hydrophobic portion of a phospholipid molecule is associated with the nonpolar portions of other membrane constituents, such as glycolipids, proteins, and cholesterol. The hydrophilic (polar) head of the phospholipid extends outward, interacting with the intracellular or extracellular aqueous environment (see Fig. 17.1A).

The major phospholipid made is phosphatidylcholine, which can be formed in three steps from choline, two fatty acids, and glycerol phosphate (Figure 12\u201353). Each step is catalyzed by enzymes in the ER membrane, which have their active sites facing the cytosol, where all of the required metabolites are found. Thus, phospholipid synthesis occurs exclusively in the cytosolic leaflet of the ER membrane. Because fatty acids are not soluble in water, they are shepherded from their sites of synthesis to the ER by a fatty acid binding protein in the cytosol. After arrival in the ER membrane and activation with CoA, acyl transferases successively add two fatty acids to glycerol phosphate to produce phosphatidic acid.

            "content": "Having considered in general terms how a mitochondrion uses electron transport to generate a proton-motive force, we now turn to the molecular mechanisms that underlie this membrane-based energy-conversion process. In describing the respiratory chain of mitochondria, we accomplish the larger purpose of explaining how an electron-transport process can pump protons across a membrane. As stated at the beginning of this chapter, mitochondria, chloroplasts, archaea, and bacteria use very similar chemiosmotic mechanisms. In fact, these mechanisms underlie the function of all living organisms\u2014including anaerobes that derive all their energy from electron transfers between two inorganic molecules, as we shall see later. We start with some of the basic principles on which all of these processes depend. the redox potential Is a Measure of Electron affinities"

Their derivatives can form larger aggregates held together by hydrophobic forces: Triacylglycerols (triglycerides) can form large spherical fat droplets in the cell cytoplasm. Phospholipids and glycolipids form self-sealing lipid bilayers that are the basis for all cell membranes. 200 nm or more micelle long-chain polymers of isoprene O OTHER LIPIDS Lipids are defned as the water-insoluble molecules in cells that are soluble in organic solvents. Two other common types of lipids are steroids and polyisoprenoids. Both are made from isoprene units. CH3CCHCH2CH2isoprene STEROIDS Steroids have a common multiple-ring structure."

The development of new detergents and new expression systems that produce large quantities of membrane proteins from cDNA clones has led to a rapid increase in the number of three-dimensional structures of membrane proteins and protein complexes that are known, although they are still few compared to the known structures of water-soluble proteins and protein complexes.

The plasma membrane is a lipid bilayer consisting primarily of phospholipid molecules, cholesterol, and protein molecules. The hydrophobic fatty-acid chains of phospholipids face each other to form the inner portion of the membrane, whereas the hydrophilic polar heads of the phospholipids form the extracellular and intracellular surfaces of the membrane. Cholesterol molecules are incorporated within the gaps between phospholipids equally on both sides of the membrane. Note the elevated area of the lipid raft that is characterized by the high concentration of glycosphingolipids and cholesterol. It contains large numbers of integral and peripheral membrane proteins. The raft protrudes above the level of asymmetrically distributed phospholipids in the membrane bilayer (indicated by the different colors of the phospholipid heads). Carbohydrate chains attach to both integral and peripheral membrane proteins to"
