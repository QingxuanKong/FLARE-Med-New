    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step. Step 1: Understand the context of the question The question is about the progression of cells into the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, based on an endometrial biopsy specimen showing regular tubular endometrial glands with abundant mitotic figures in the endometrial glands and stroma. Step 2: Recall the key events of the menstrual cycle The menstrual cycle is regulated by the interplay of estrogen and progesterone. The proliferative phase is characterized by the increase in estrogen levels, which stimulates the growth and proliferation of the endometrium. Step 3: Identify the proteins/enzymes involved in cell cycle progression In the context of the menstrual cycle, the proteins/enzymes involved in cell cycle progression are those that regulate the G1-S transition and the G2-M transition. Among the options provided, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are the most relevant. Step 4: Connect CDKs to the proliferative phase Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly in the G1-S transition. In the context of the menstrual cycle, CDKs are involved in the proliferative phase, where estrogen stimulates the growth and proliferation of the endometrium. Step 5: Eliminate irrelevant options AMP-dependent kinases, hexokinases, and lipid kinases are not directly involved in the regulation of the cell cycle in the context of the menstrual cycle. Step 6: Choose the correct answer Based on the above steps, the correct answer is B. Cyclin-dependent kinases. Here is the final answer in the required json format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the progression of cells into the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, based on an endometrial biopsy specimen showing regular tubular endometrial glands with abundant mitotic figures in the endometrial glands and stroma.

At the end of the menstrual phase, the endometrium consists of a thin band of connective tissue, about 1 mm thick, containing the basal portions of the uterine glands and the lower portions of the spiral arteries (see Fig. 23.15). This layer is the stratum basale; the layer that was sloughed off was the stratum functionale. Under the infuence of estrogens, the proliferative phase is initiated. Stromal, endothelial, and epithelial cells in the stratum basale proliferate rapidly, and the following changes can be seen: \u0081 Epithelial cells in the basal portion of the glands reconstitute the glands and migrate to cover the denuded endometrial surface. \u0081 Stromal cells proliferate and secrete collagen and ground substance. \u0081 Spiral arteries lengthen as the endometrium is reestablished; these arteries are only slightly coiled and do not extend into the upper third of the endometrium."

After menses, the decidua basalis is composed of primordial glands and dense scant stroma in its location adjacent to the myometrium. The proliferative phase is characterized by progressive mitotic growth of the decidua functionalis in preparation for implantation of the embryo in response to rising circulating levels of estrogen (61). At the beginning of the proliferative phase, the endometrium is relatively thin (1\u20132 mm). The predominant change seen during this time is evolution of the initially straight, narrow, and short endometrial glands into longer, tortuous structures (62). Histologically, these proliferating glands have multiple mitotic cells, and their organization changes from a low columnar pattern in the early proliferative period to a pseudostratified pattern before ovulation. Throughout this time, the stroma is a dense compact layer, and vascular structures are infrequently seen."

These changes proceed in an orderly fashion in response to cyclic hormonal production by the ovaries (Fig. 7.9). Histologic cycling of the endometrium can best be viewed in two parts: the endometrial glands and the surrounding stroma. The superficial two-thirds of the endometrium is the zone that proliferates and is ultimately shed with each cycle if pregnancy does not occur. This cycling portion of the endometrium is known as the decidua functionalis and is composed of a deeply situated intermediate zone (stratum spongiosum) and a superficial compact zone (stratum compactum). The decidua basalis is the deepest region of the endometrium. It does not undergo significant monthly proliferation but, instead, is the source of endometrial regeneration after each menses (58)."

Within 48 to 72 hours following ovulation, the onset of progesterone secretion produces a shift in histologic appearance of the endometrium to the secretory phase, so named for the clear presence of eosinophilic protein-rich secretory products in the glandular lumen. In contrast to the proliferative phase, the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle is characterized by the cellular effects of progesterone in addition to estrogen. In general, progesterone\u2019s effects are antagonistic to those of estrogen, and there is a progressive decrease in the endometrial cell\u2019s estrogen receptor concentration. As a result, during the latter half of the cycle, estrogen-induced DNA synthesis and cellular mitosis are antagonized (61)."

Under the infuence of progesterone, dramatic changes occur in the stratum functionale, beginning a day or two after ovulation. The endometrium becomes edematous and may eventually reach a thickness of 5 mm to 6 mm. The glands enlarge and become corkscrew shaped, and their lumina become sacculated as they fill with secretory products (Fig. 23.16b). The mucoid fluid produced by the gland epithelium is rich in nutrients, particularly glycogen, required to support development if implantation occurs. Mitoses are now rare. The growth seen at this stage results from hypertrophy of the epithelial cells, an increase in vascularity, and edema of the endometrium. The spiral arteries, however, lengthen and become more coiled. They extend nearly to the surface of the endometrium (Plate 97, page 882)."

During this phase, the stratum functionale (separated by the dashed line from the stratum basale) greatly thickens. 15. The lower panel shows at higher magnification the endometrial glands that extend from the stratum basale to the surface. 55. b. The upper panel shows the endometrium at the secretory phase of the cycle. The glands have acquired a corkscrew shape as the endometrium increases further in thickness. The stratum basale (below the dashed line) exhibits less dramatic changes in morphology. 20. The lower panel shows uterine glands that have been cut in a plane that is close to their long axes. Note the pronounced corkscrew shape of the glands and mucous secretion (arrows). 60. c. The upper panel shows the stratum functionale (above the dashed line). Much of the stratum functionale has degenerated and sloughed away. 15. The lower panel shows the extravasated blood and necrosis of the stratum"

            "content": "Symptoms Endometrial carcinoma most often occurs in women in the sixth and seventh decades of life, at an average age of 60 years; 75% of cases occur in women older than 50 years of age. About 90% of women with endometrial carcinoma have vaginal bleeding or discharge as their only presenting symptom. Most women recognize the importance of this symptom and seek medical consultation within 3 months. Some women experience pelvic pressure or discomfort indicative of uterine enlargement or extrauterine disease spread. Bleeding may not have occurred because of cervical stenosis, especially in older patients, and may be associated with hematometra or pyometra, causing a purulent vaginal discharge. This finding is often associated with a poor prognosis (69). Less than 5% of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer are asymptomatic. In the absence of symptoms, endometrial cancer usually is detected as the result of investigation of abnormal Pap test results, discovery of cancer in a uterus"

Patient A (blue) has mean blood pressures near the 20th percentile throughout pregnancy. Patient B (red) has a similar pattern with mean pressures at the 25th percentile until approximately 36 weeks when her blood pressure begins to rise. By term, it is substantively higher and in the 75th percentile, but she is still considered \"normotensive.\" 25th percentile until 32 weeks. These begin to rise in patient B, who by term has substantively higher blood pressures. However, her pressures are still < 140/90 mm Hg, and thus she is considered to be \"normotensive.\" We use the term delta hypertension to describe this rather acute rise in blood pressure. Some of these women will go on to have obvious preeclampsia, and some even develop eclamptic seizures or HELLP (hemolysis, devatedliver enzyme levels, low 2latelet count) syndrome while still normotensive."

            "content": "Secondary dysmenorrhea is caused by underlying pelvic pathology. Endometriosis results from the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus. These deposits of ectopic endometrium respond to hormonal stimulation and cause dysmenorrhea, which begins several days before menses. Endometriosis also may be associated with painful intercourse, painful bowel movements, and tender nodules in the uterosacral ligament. Fibrosis and adhesions can produce lateral displacement of the cervix. Transvaginal pelvic ultrasound is part of the initial workup and may detect an endometrioma within the ovary, rectovaginal or bladder nodules, or ureteral involvement. The CA125 level may be increased, but it has low negative predictive value. Definitive diagnosis requires laparoscopy. Symptomatology does not always predict the extent of endometriosis. The prevalence is lower in black and Hispanic women than in Caucasians and Asians. Other secondary causes of dysmenorrhea include adenomyosis, a"

            "content": "The cervical mucosa measures about 2 to 3 mm in thickness and differs dramatically from the rest of the uterine endometrium in that it contains large, branched glands (Fig. 23.19 and Plate 98, page 884). It also lacks spiral arteries. The cervical mucosa undergoes little change in thickness during the menstrual cycle and is not sloughed during the period of menstruation. During each menstrual cycle, however, the cervical glands undergo important functional changes that are related to the transport of spermatozoa within the cervical canal. The amount and properties of the mucus secreted by the gland cells vary during the menstrual cycle under the influence of the ovarian hormones. At midcycle, the amount of mucus produced increases 10-fold. This mucus is less viscous and appears to provide a more favorable environment for sperm migration. The cervical mucus at other times in the cycle restricts the passage of sperm into the uterus. Thus, hormonal mechanisms ensure that ovulation and"
