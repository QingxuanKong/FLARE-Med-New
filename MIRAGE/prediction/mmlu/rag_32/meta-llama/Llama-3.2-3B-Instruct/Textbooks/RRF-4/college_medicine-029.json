    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the anatomy and physiology of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). A VSD is a hole in the septum between the right and left ventricles. This defect allows blood to flow from the left ventricle (higher pressure) to the right ventricle (lower pressure), resulting in left-to-right shunting. As a result, the right ventricle receives more blood and oxygen than usual, leading to right ventricular hypertrophy and increased pulmonary blood flow. The left ventricle, on the other hand, receives less blood and oxygen, leading to left ventricular dilation. The oxygenated blood from the lungs is still returned to the left atrium, but the amount of oxygen in the right atrium and ventricle is lower than normal due to the shunting. The question asks which statement is correct about the oxygen levels in the right ventricle. Based on the anatomy and physiology of VSD, we can determine that the percentage of oxygen in the right ventricle would be lower due to the left-to-right shunting of blood from the left ventricle to the right ventricle. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Failure of septal growth or excessive reabsorption of tissue leads to ASDs (Fig. 143-2). ASDs represent approximately 10% of all congenital heart defects. A secundum defect, with the hole in the region of the foramen ovale, is the most common ASD. A primum ASD, located near the endocardial cushions, may be part of a complete atrioventricular canal defect or may be present with an intact ventricular septum. The least common ASD is the sinus venosus defect, which may be associated with anomalous pulmonary venous return."

This leads to right ventricular hypertrophy, increased pulmonary blood flow, elevated arterial pulmonary pressure, and increased blood volume returning to the left ventricle, causing its dilation. Increased pulmonary pressure in most severe cases may cause pulmonary edema. If large enough and left untreated, VSDs can produce marked clinical problems that might require surgery.

AV canal defects result from failure of fusion of the endocardial cushions in the central portion of the heart, caus-ing a lesion that involves the atrial and the ventricular septum, as well as the anterior mitral and septal tricuspid valve leaf-lets. Defects involving primarily the atrial septum are known as partial AV canal defects and frequently occur in conjunction with a cleft anterior mitral leaflet. Complete AV canal defects have a combined deficiency of the atrial and ventricular sep-tum associated with a common AV orifice rather than"

During ventricular systole, the lateral leaflets of the mitral and triscuspid valves come together in the midline. But the atrioventricular valve plane is abnormal, a common atrium (A) is observed, and there is a visible defect (arrow) in the interventricular septum. B. During diastolic filling, opening of the atrioventricular valves more clearly demonstrates the absence of their medial leaflets. Table 10-9, and examples of nine required gray-scale imaging views are shown in Figure 10-28. Examples of selected cardiac anomalies are reviewed below."

            "content": "This is a family of complex lesions with both atrioventricular valves or a common atrioventricular valve opening to a single ventricular chamber. Associated anomalies include abnormal great artery positional relationships, pulmonic valvular or subvalvular stenosis, and subaortic stenosis. Survival to adulthood depends on a relatively normal pulmonary blood flow, yet normal pulmonary resistance and good ventricular function. Modifications of the Fontan approach are generally applied to carefully selected patients with creation of a pathway(s) from the systemic veins to the pulmonary arteries. This malformation is characterized by atresia of the tricuspid valve; an interatrial communication; and, frequently, hypoplasia of the RV and pulmonary artery. The clinical picture is usually dominated by severe cyanosis due to obligatory admixture of systemic and pulmonary venous blood in the LV. The ECG characteristically shows RA enlargement, left-axis deviation, and LV hypertrophy."
