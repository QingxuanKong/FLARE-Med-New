The submandibular lymph nodes receive lymphatic drainage from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, the anterior two-thirds of the hard palate, the lower lip, the lower anterior teeth, and the anterior part of the mandible. Given this information, the potential infection sites for the enlarged submandibular lymph nodes would be the hard palate, upper lip, and upper central incisor. This is because these areas are directly connected to the submandibular lymph nodes through the lymphatic drainage pathway. Therefore, if there is an infection in these areas, it is likely that the submandibular lymph nodes would become enlarged.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Patients with parotid disease benefit from a superficial or total parotidectomy (with facial nerve preservation) and adjuvant radiotherapy. Sentinel lymph node dissection may be used in high risk cases with clinically negative nodal disease. Radiation therapy is typically reserved as primary therapy for those who are poor surgical candidates, and as adjuvant therapy after surgi-cal resection for large, high-risk tumors. When used as primary"

As previously mentioned, because of the epidemic rise in incidence of oropharyngeal cancers, secondary to HPV-associated tumors, and the high regional metastatic rate for these tumors, the pre-senting symptom is often a nontender cervical lymphadenopa-thy, which should be investigated with a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Approximately 50% of patients have metastases at the time of diagnosis. Bilateral metastases are common in patients with soft palate and base of tongue tumors. Treatment of the neck should include the upper jugulodigastric nodes to which these tumors most commonly metastasize to, followed by levels II, IV, V, and the retropharyngeal lymph nodes.A discussion about oropharyngeal cancer cannot be had without discussing the important prognostic information pro-vided by the HPV status of these tumors. The incidence of oro-pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma has increased significantly over the last four decades secondary"

Important findings include presence or absence of dental disease, oropharyngeal or skin lesions, ocular disease, other nodal enlargement, and any other signs of systemic illness, including hepatosplenomegaly and skin lesions. Acute cervical lymphadenopathy associated with pharyngitis is characterized by small and rubbery lymph nodes in the anterior cervical chain with minimal to moderate tenderness. Suppurative cervical lymphadenitis, frequently caused by S. aureus or group A streptococcus, shows erythema and warmth of the overlying skin with moderate to exquisite tenderness."

It is used as a sclerotherapy agent for lymphatic malformations and has a 94% response rate in macrocystic lesions, a 63% response rate in mixed macromicrocystic lesions, and no response in micro-cystic lesions.60TRAUMA OF THE HEAD AND NECKSoft TissueSoft tissue trauma of the head and neck is managed with the same general surgical principles as any other body subsite with a few particularities. Most lacerations can be closed primarily if there is not soft tissue loss; even some devitalized soft tis-sue should be preserved because of the excellent blood sup-ply to head and neck tissue that allows it to recover at a higher rate. Thus, minimal debridement is usually required. Thor-ough irrigation to remove foreign bodies and clean the tissue is required. This is followed by a careful layered closure. On the face, the deep layers are usually closed with a 3-0 or"

A relatively simple \u201clevel\u201d system of nodal enlargement has been designed that is extremely helpful in evaluating lymph node spread of primary head and neck tumors. Once the number of levels of nodes are determined, and the size of the lymph nodes, the best mode of treatment can be instituted. This may include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The lymph node level also enables a prognosis to be made. The levels are as follows (Fig. 8.199): Level I\u2014from the midline of the submental triangle up to the level of the submandibular gland. Level II\u2014from the skull base to the level of the hyoid bone anteriorly from the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Level III\u2014the inferior aspect of the hyoid bone to the bottom cricoid arch and anterior to the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid up to the midline."
