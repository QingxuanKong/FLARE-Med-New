    "question": "A previously healthy 17-year-old girl comes to the emergency department because of a 5-day history of progressive lower abdominal pain, fever, and malodorous vaginal discharge. Menarche was at the age of 12 years, and her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses a combination contraceptive patch. Her temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows severe lower quadrant tenderness bilaterally. Pelvic examination shows a purulent cervical discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness. Her hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 13,000/mm3 , and platelet count is 345,000/mm3 . A urine pregnancy test is negative.

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step analysis of the question: **Step 1: Assess the patient's symptoms and presentation** The patient is a 17-year-old girl with a 5-day history of progressive lower abdominal pain, fever, and malodorous vaginal discharge. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses a combination contraceptive patch. The symptoms of fever, malodorous discharge, and lower abdominal pain are suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can cause inflammation of the female reproductive organs. **Step 2: Evaluate the patient's risk factors for PID** The patient is sexually active, which increases her risk for PID. She also uses a combination contraceptive patch, which may not provide adequate protection against STIs. The presence of malodorous vaginal discharge further supports the diagnosis of PID. **Step 3: Consider the patient's laboratory results** The patient's laboratory results show a low hemoglobin concentration, elevated leukocyte count, and normal platelet count. These findings are consistent with an acute infection. **Step 4: Evaluate the patient's physical examination findings** The patient's physical examination shows severe lower quadrant tenderness bilaterally, purulent cervical discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness. These findings are consistent with PID. **Step 5: Consider the patient's pregnancy test result** The patient's urine pregnancy test is negative, which reduces the likelihood of ectopic pregnancy as a cause of her symptoms. **Step 6: Choose the most appropriate pharmacotherapy** Based on the patient's symptoms, risk factors, laboratory results, physical examination findings, and pregnancy test result, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for PID is: **D. Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline** Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, which are common causes of PID. Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that is also effective against Chlamydia trachomatis. The combination of ceftriaxone and doxycycline provides broad-spectrum coverage against both gonococcal and chlamydial infections. Here is the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of PID, including fever, malodorous vaginal discharge, and lower abdominal pain. The patient is sexually active and uses a combination contraceptive patch, which increases her risk for PID. The laboratory results and physical examination findings support the diagnosis of PID.

The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for PID is intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline, which provides broad-spectrum coverage against both gonococcal and chlamydial infections.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Such masses may consist of a tubo-ovarian complex (a mass of matted bowel, tube, and ovary), tubo-ovarian abscess (a mass consisting primarily of an abscess cavity within an anatomically defined structure such as the ovary), pyosalpinx, or, chronically, hydrosalpinx. The diagnosis of PID is primarily a clinical one based on the presence of lower abdominal, pelvic, and adnexal tenderness; cervical motion tenderness; a mucopurulent discharge; and elevated temperature, white blood cell count, or sedimentation rate (see Chapter 18). The risk of PID is clearly associated with that of acquiring STDs, and methods of contraception may either decrease the risk (male latex condoms) or increase it (the intrauterine device in the interval immediately after insertion) (122,123)."

Hospitalized patients can be considered for discharge when their fever has lysed (<99.5\u25e6F for more than 24 hours), the white blood cell count has become normal, rebound tenderness is absent, and repeat examination shows marked amelioration of pelvic organ tenderness (42).

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

Diverticulitis is less likely to lead to perforation and peritonitis than is appendicitis. Fever, chills, and constipation typically are present, but anorexia and vomiting are uncommon. Bowel sounds are hypoactive and are substantially decreased with peritonitis related to a ruptured diverticular abscess. Abdominal examination reveals distention with left lower quadrant tenderness on direct palpation and localized rebound tenderness. Abdominal and bimanual rectovaginal examinations may reveal a poorly mobile, doughy in\ufb02ammatory mass in the left lower quadrant. Leukocytosis and fever are common. Stool guaiac may be positive as a result of in\ufb02ammation of the colon or microperforation."

The extent of the physical examination during the gynecologic visit is often dictated by the patient\u2019s primary concerns and symptoms. For example, for healthy teens without symptoms who are requesting oral contraceptives before the initiation of intercourse, a gynecologic examination is not necessarily required. Some aspects of the examination\u2014such as assessment of vital signs and measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, and calculation of a body mass index\u2014 should be performed routinely during most office visits. Typically, examination of the breasts and abdomen and a complete examination of the pelvis are considered to be essential parts of the gynecologic examination. It is often helpful to ask the patient if the gynecologic examination was difficult for her in the past; this"

Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice?
