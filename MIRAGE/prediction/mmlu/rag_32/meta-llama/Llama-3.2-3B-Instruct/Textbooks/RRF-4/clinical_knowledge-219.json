To answer this question, we need to consider the implications of diabetes on the body. Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way the body regulates blood sugar levels. If left unmanaged, diabetes can lead to various complications that can affect multiple organ systems. These complications can be severe and even life-threatening. Therefore, managing diabetes is crucial to prevent or delay the onset of these complications. The correct answer should highlight the significance of diabetes in terms of its impact on the body and the potential consequences of poor management. \\n\\nLet\\u2019s evaluate the options:\\n\\nA. These patients are more likely to bleed. \\n\\nThere is no direct link between diabetes and an increased risk of bleeding. This option does not accurately reflect the importance of diabetes.\\n\\nB. These patients are more likely to get urinary tract infections if their blood sugar is unstable. \\n\\nUnstable blood sugar levels can increase the risk of infections, including urinary tract infections. This option highlights a potential consequence of poor diabetes management.\\n\\nC. These patients are more likely to have clear urine. \\n\\nDiabetes can lead to diabetic nephropathy, which can cause kidney damage and lead to urinary tract problems, including cloudy or foul-smelling urine. This option is incorrect because diabetes is more likely to cause cloudy or foul-smelling urine due to kidney damage.\\n\\nD. These patients are less likely to have catheter encrustation. \\n\\nDiabetes can increase the risk of catheter-related infections, including encrustation.

Powers The goals of therapy for type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) are to (1) eliminate symptoms related to hyperglycemia, (2) reduce or eliminate the long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications of DM (Chap. 419), and (3) allow the patient to achieve as normal a lifestyle as possible. To reach these goals, the physician should identify a target level of glycemic control for each patient, provide the patient with the educational and pharmacologic resources necessary to reach this level, and monitor/treat DM-related complications. Symptoms of diabetes usually resolve when the plasma glucose is <11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), and thus most DM treatment focuses on achieving the second and third goals. This chapter first reviews the ongoing treatment of diabetes in the outpatient setting and then discusses the treatment of severe hyperglycemia, as well as the treatment of diabetes in hospitalized patients."
