    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the role of ATP and phosphocreatine in muscle contraction and their ability to sustain maximal exertion exercise. According to Document [6] (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco), creatine phosphate (phosphocreatine) is a high-energy compound that provides a small but rapidly mobilized reserve of high-energy phosphates that can be reversibly transferred to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to maintain the intracellular level of ATP during the first few minutes of intense muscular contraction. This implies that the energy released from the breakdown of high-energy phosphates, ATP and phosphocreatine, can sustain muscle contraction for a relatively short period. Document [3] (Title: Physiology_Levy) states that the creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise, and that skeletal muscle fatigue during intense exercise is associated with depletion of the creatine phosphate store. Furthermore, Document [13] (Title: Physiology_Levy) indicates that the oxygen debt is approximately equal to the energy consumed during exercise minus that supplied by oxidative metabolism, and that this oxygen debt is much greater with strenuous exercise. Given that the energy released from the breakdown of high-energy phosphates is used to replenish the ATP supply, it is reasonable to conclude that this energy can sustain maximal exertion exercise for a relatively short period, such as 30-40 seconds. This duration is consistent with the idea that the energy released from the breakdown of high-energy phosphates is sufficient to replenish the ATP supply during intense exercise, but not enough to sustain prolonged muscle contraction. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 30-40 seconds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of ATP near the myosin heads during muscle contraction. The phosphate store created, however, is only about five times the size of the ATP store and thus cannot support prolonged periods of contraction (less than a minute of maximal muscle activity).

The efficiency of the heart as a pump is relatively low. During physical exercise, efficiency improves because mean blood pressure does not change appreciably, whereas cardiac output and work increase considerably, without a proportional increase in myocardial O2 consumption. Of interest is that the chemical efficiency of the heart is rather high, as indicated by the estimate of 60% for the efficiency of generating ATP from oxidative phosphorylation.

During a short period of intense exercise, the muscle uses carbohydrate derived from glycogen stores; myophosphorylase is the enzyme that initiates the metabolism of glycogen. With longer aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen stores, energy is provided by oxidation of fatty acids. Thus, muscle failure at a certain phase of exercise is predictive of the type of energy failure.

Regular maximal-strength exercise, such as weightlifting, induces the synthesis of more myofibrils and hence hypertrophy of the active muscle cells. The increased stress also induces the growth of tendons and bones. Endurance exercise does not cause fast motor units to become slow, nor does maximal muscular effort produce a shift from slow to fast motor units.

Myosin next undergoes a conformational change termed \u201cratchet action\u201d that pulls the actin filament toward the center of the sarcomere (state c). Myosin releases adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate during the transition to state c. Binding of ATP to myosin decreases the affinity of myosin for actin, thereby resulting in the release of myosin from the actin filament (state d). Myosin then partially hydrolyzes the ATP, and part of the energy in the ATP is used to recock the head and return to the resting state."

            "content": "Myocardial energy is stored as creatine phosphate (CP), which is in equilibrium with ATP, the immediate source of energy. In states of reduced energy availability, the CP stores decline first. Cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, tachycardia, increased wall tension resulting from ventricular dilation, and increased intracytoplasmic [Ca2+] all contribute to increased myocardial energy needs. When coupled with reduced coronary flow reserve, as occurs with obstruction of coronary arteries or abnormalities of the coronary microcirculation, an imbalance in myocardial ATP production relative to demand may occur, and the resulting ischemia can worsen or cause heart failure."

            "content": "The major circulatory adjustment to prolonged exercise occurs in the vasculature of the active muscles. Local formation of vasoactive metabolites causes marked dilation of the resistance vessels. This dilation progresses with increases in the intensity of exercise. Potassium is one of the vasodilator substances released by the contracting muscle, and this ion may be partly responsible for the initial decrease in vascular resistance in the active muscles. Other contributing factors may be the release of adenosine and a decrease in tissue pH during sustained exercise. The local accumulation of metabolites causes the terminal arterioles to relax, and blood flow through the muscle may increase 15to 20-fold above the resting level. This metabolic vasodilation of the precapillary vessels in active muscles occurs very soon after the onset of exercise. The decrease in TPR enables the heart to pump more blood at a lesser load, and it pumps more efficiently than if TPR were unchanged (see \u2022Fig."

As detailed in Figure 2\u201348, the first enzyme (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) forms a short-lived covalent bond to the aldehyde through a reactive \u2013SH group on the enzyme, and catalyzes its oxidation by NAD+ in this attached state. The reactive enzyme\u2013substrate bond is then displaced by an inorganic phosphate ion to produce a high-energy phosphate intermediate, which is released from the enzyme. This intermediate binds to the second enzyme (phosphoglycerate kinase), which catalyzes the energetically favorable transfer of the high-energy phosphate just created to ADP, forming ATP and completing the process of oxidizing an aldehyde to a carboxylic acid. Note that the C\u2013H bond oxidation energy in step 6 drives the formation of both NADH and a high-energy phosphate bond. The breakage of the high-energy bond then drives ATP formation."
