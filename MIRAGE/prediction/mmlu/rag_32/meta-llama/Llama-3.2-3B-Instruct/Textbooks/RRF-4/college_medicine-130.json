SDS is a detergent that is used to solubilize proteins and separate them based on their size. The correct answer can be inferred by analyzing the purpose of using SDS in SDS-PAGE. The key points to consider are: (1) SDS is used to solubilize proteins, (2) SDS is used to separate proteins based on size, and (3) SDS breaks the intramolecular bonds holding the protein together, generating linear fragments that can be sorted on size. The correct answer can be deduced by analyzing these points and eliminating the incorrect options. Option A is incorrect because SDS does not coat the proteins with a large positive charge. Option B is incorrect because SDS is used to separate proteins based on size, not solely on the length of the primary sequence. Option C is incorrect because SDS is used to break the intramolecular bonds, not to preserve the tertiary structure. Option D is correct because SDS breaks the intramolecular bonds, generating linear fragments that can be sorted on size. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

An electric field applied to a solution containing a protein molecule causes the protein to migrate at a rate that depends on its net charge and on its size and shape. The most popular application of this property is SDS polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). It uses a highly cross-linked gel of polyacrylamide as the inert matrix through which the proteins migrate. The gel is prepared by polymerization of monomers; the pore size of the gel can be adjusted so that it is small enough to retard the migration of the protein molecules of interest. The proteins are dissolved in a solution that includes a powerful negatively charged detergent, sodium dodecyl sulfate, or SDS (Figure 8\u201312).

Each protein molecule binds large numbers of the negatively charged detergent molecules, which mask the protein\u2019s intrinsic charge and cause it to migrate toward the positive electrode when a voltage is applied. Proteins of the same size tend to move through the gel with similar speeds because (1) their native structure is completely unfolded by the SDS, so that their shapes are the same, and (2) they bind the same amount of SDS and therefore have the same amount of negative charge. Larger proteins, with more charge, are subjected to larger electrical forces but also to a larger drag. In free solution, the two effects would cancel out, but, in the mesh of the polyacrylamide gel, which acts as a molecular sieve, large proteins are retarded much more than small ones.

The positions of the by incubating cells with radioactive amino acids (shown here for labeled proteins are determined by autoradiography using X-ray methionine; 35S-Met), or one can label just the cell-surface proteins film. This technique of SDS-PAGE can be used to determine the by using radioactive iodine in a form that cannot cross the cell molecular weight and subunit composition of a protein. Patterns of membrane or by a reaction with the small molecule biotin, detected protein bands observed with metabolic labeling are usually more by its reaction with labeled avidin (not shown).

            "content": "or tissues, respectively.Immunoblotting refers to the process of identifying a pro-tein from a mixture of proteins (Fig. 15-18). It consists of five steps: (a) sample preparation; (b) electrophoresis (separation of a protein mixture by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis); (c) transfer (the electrophoretic transfer of proteins from gel onto membrane support [e.g., nitrocel-lulose, nylon, or polyvinylidene difluoride]); (d) staining (the subsequent immunodetection of target proteins with specific antibody); and (e) development (colorimetric, chemilumines-cent, and recently fluorescent visualization of the antibody-recognized protein). Thus, immunoblotting combines the resolution of gel electrophoresis with the specificity of immu-nochemical detection. Immunoblotting is a powerful tool used to determine a number of important characteristics of proteins. For example, immunoblotting analysis will determine the pres-ence and the quantity of a protein in a given"

            "content": "Fig. A.14 Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of MHC class II molecules. Proteins in mouse spleen cells have been labeled metabolically (see Fig. A.13), precipitated with a monoclonal antibody against the mouse MHC class II molecule H2-A, and separated by isoelectric focusing in one direction and SDS-PAGE in a second direction at right angles to the first (hence the term two-dimensional gel electrophoresis). This allows one to distinguish molecules of the same molecular weight on the basis of their charge. The separated proteins are detected by autoradiography. The MHC class II molecules are composed of two chains, \u03b1 and \u03b2, and in the different MHC class II molecules these have different isoelectric points (compare upper and lower panels). The MHC genotype of mice is indicated by lowercase superscripts (k, p). Actin, a common contaminant, is marked a. Photographs courtesy of J.F. Babich."
