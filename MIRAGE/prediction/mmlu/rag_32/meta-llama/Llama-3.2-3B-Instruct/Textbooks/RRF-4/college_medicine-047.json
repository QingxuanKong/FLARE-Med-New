The spectator makes a generalization about welfare recipients, implying that they are all lazy. This is an example of a thought process that is based on stereotypes and oversimplification. The spectator is likely relying on limited information and not considering individual differences or exceptions. This type of thinking is characteristic of prejudice, which involves making judgments about a group based on preconceived notions or stereotypes. The spectator's statement is not necessarily driven by a desire to discriminate or harm a specific group, but rather by a flawed understanding of the issue. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is prejudice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" ``` The spectator's thought process is an example of prejudice because they are making a generalization about a group (welfare recipients) based on a preconceived notion or stereotype, without considering individual differences or exceptions.",

These assumptions do not hold in medical care, in part because of selection and moral hazard; economists term the result a market failure.

The doctor\u2013patient relationship is inherently unbalanced in the distribution of power. In light of their influence, physicians must always be aware of the potential impact of what they do and say and must always strive to strip away individual biases and preferences to find what is best for the patient. To the extent possible, physicians should also act within their communities to promote health and alleviate suffering. Meeting these goals begins by setting a healthy example and continues in taking action to deliver needed care even when personal financial compensation may not be available. A goal for medicine and its practitioners is to strive to provide the means by which the poor can cease to be unwell."
