    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option in relation to the provided documents about the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).\\n\\nOption A: It has an articular disc of hyaline cartilage. According to Document [0], the temporomandibular joint is formed between the head of the mandible and the articular fossa and articular tubercle of the temporal bone. Unlike most other synovial joints, the articular surfaces of the TMJ are covered by fibrocartilage, not hyaline cartilage.\\n\\nOption B: Its articular surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage. This statement is false, as explained in Option A.\\n\\nOption C: Proprioceptive information is carried by the chorda tympani and deep temporal nerves. The chorda tympani nerve primarily carries taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and is not involved in proprioception. Proprioceptive information is not explicitly mentioned as being carried by the deep temporal nerves in the provided documents.\\n\\nOption D: Proprioceptive information is carried by the masseteric and auriculotemporal nerves. The auriculotemporal nerve does carry sensory information, but it is not primarily responsible for proprioception. The masseteric nerve is primarily a motor nerve, and there is no clear indication that it carries proprioceptive information.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is B. Its articular surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage. This is the only statement that is consistent with the provided documents about the temporomandibular joint.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Each joint is synovial and is formed between the head of the mandible and the articular fossa and articular tubercle of the temporal bone (Fig. 8.138A). Unlike most other synovial joints where the articular surfaces of the bones are covered by a layer of hyaline cartilage, those of the temporomandibular joint are covered by fibrocartilage. In addition, the joint is completely divided by a fibrous articular disc into two parts: The lower part of the joint allows mainly the hinge-like depression and elevation of the mandible. The upper part of the joint allows the head of the mandible to translocate forward (protrusion) onto the articular tubercle and backward (retraction) into the mandibular fossa. Opening the mouth involves both depression and protrusion (Fig. 8.138B)."

Most patients, according to Scrivani and colleagues report deviation of the mandible to the affected side on jaw opening and clicking noises emanating from the joint. Locking of the jaw in either the open or closed position is another feature. The diagnosis is supported by the findings of tenderness over the joint, crepitus on opening the mouth, and limitation of jaw opening.

In most instances, toothache is predictable and proportional to the stimulus applied, and an identifiable condition (e.g., caries, abscess) is found. Local anesthesia eliminates pain originating from dental or periodontal structures, but not referred pains. The most common nondental source of pain is myofascial pain referred from muscles of mastication, which become tender and ache with increased use. Many sufferers exhibit bruxism (grinding of the teeth) secondary to stress and anxiety. Temporomandibular joint disorder is closely related. It affects both sexes, with a higher prevalence among women. Features include pain, limited mandibular movement, and temporomandibular joint sounds. The etiologies are complex; malocclusion does not play the primary role once attributed to it. Osteoarthritis is a common cause of masticatory pain."

The tympanic part of the temporal bone is a flat concave plate of bone that curves inferiorly from the back of the mandibular fossa and forms part of the wall of the external auditory meatus. When viewed from inferiorly, there is a distinct tympanosquamous fissure between the tympanic and squamous parts of the temporal bone. Medially, a small slip of bone from the petrous part of the temporal bone insinuates itself into the fissure and forms a petrotympanic fissure between it and the tympanic part (Fig. 8.136). The chorda tympani nerve exits the skull and enters the infratemporal fossa through the medial end of the petrotympanic fissure."

Movements of the mandible include depression, elevation, protrusion, and retraction (Fig. 8.140): Depression is generated by the digastric, geniohyoid, and mylohyoid muscles on both sides, is normally assisted by gravity, and, because it involves forward movement of the head of the mandible onto the articular tubercle, the lateral pterygoid muscles are also involved.

            "content": "The auriculotemporal nerve passes first between the tensor veli palatini muscle and the upper head of the lateral pterygoid muscle, and then between the sphenomandibular ligament and the neck of the mandible. It curves laterally around the neck of the mandible and then ascends deep to the parotid gland between the temporomandibular joint and ear. The terminal branches of the auriculotemporal nerve carry general sensation from skin over a large area of the temple. In addition, the auriculotemporal nerve contributes to sensory innervation of the external ear, the external auditory meatus, tympanic membrane, and temporomandibular joint. It also delivers postganglionic parasympathetic nerves from the glossopharyngeal nerve [IX] to the parotid gland."

These bear ____ regions that recognize the antigen and ____ regions that dictate the antibody class and isotype. camelids and cartilaginous fish, however, produce ________________ and _______________, respectively, which are forming the basis for single-chain antibody production for clinical applications. 4.6 Multiple Choice: Which of the following statements is not true? A. T-cell receptor \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains pair together, but the \u03b1 chain can be switched out for a \u03b3 or a \u03b4 chain. B. electrostatic interactions (for example, a salt bridge) occur between charged amino acids."

The lateral surface of the squamous part of the temporal bone is marked by two surface features on the medial wall of the temporal fossa: a transversely oriented supramastoid crest, which extends posteriorly from the base of the zygomatic process and marks the posteroinferior border of the temporal fossa; and a vertically oriented groove for the middle temporal artery, a branch of the superficial temporal artery."

Environmental factors rarely contribute to the development of allergic disease. B. The prevalence of atopy has been steadily increasing in the developed world. C. Individuals with variant alleles of GSTP1 and GSTM1 have higher susceptibility to increased airway hyperactivity. D. Children less than 6 months old who are exposed to other children in day care appear to be partially protected against asthma. 14.4 True or False: Like other antibodies, IgE is mainly found in body fluids."
