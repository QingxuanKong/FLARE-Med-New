Cancers are monoclonal in origin, indicating that they have arisen from a single precursor cell with one or several mutations in genes controlling growth (proliferation or apoptosis) and/or differentiation. These acquired somatic mutations are restricted to the tumor and its metastases and are not found in the surrounding normal tissue. The molecular alterations include dominant gain-of-function mutations in oncogenes, recessive loss-offunction mutations in tumor-suppressor genes and DNA repair genes, gene amplification, and chromosome rearrangements. Rarely, a single mutation in certain genes may be sufficient to transform a normal cell into a malignant cell. In most cancers, however, the development of a malignant phenotype requires several genetic alterations for the gradual progression from a normal cell to a cancerous cell, a phenomenon termed"

A significant increase in the mutation frequency would presumably cause a disastrous increase in the incidence of cancer by accelerating the rate at which somatic-cell variants arise. Thus, both for the perpetuation of a species with a large number of genes (germ-cell stability) and for the prevention of cancer resulting from mutations in somatic cells (somatic-cell stability), multicellular organisms like ourselves depend on the remarkably high fidelity with which their DNA sequences are replicated and maintained."

Chromosome numbers such as 3n and 4n are called polyploid. Polyploidy generally results in a spontaneous abortion. Any number that is not an exact multiple of n is called aneuploid. The chief cause of aneuploidy is nondisjunction of a homologous pair of chromosomes at the first meiotic division or a failure of sister chromatids to separate during the second meiotic division. The latter also may occur during mitosis in somatic cells, leading to the production of two aneuploid cells. Failure of pairing of homologous chromosomes followed by random assortment (anaphase lag) also can lead to aneuploidy. When nondisjunction occurs at the time of meiosis, the gametes formed have either an extra chromosome (n + 1) or one less chromosome (n \u2212 1). Fertilization of such gametes by normal gametes would result in two types of zygotes: trisomic, with an extra chromosome (2n"

However, the stimulus also causes a permanent, approximately 180degree phase shift in locomotor rhythm, as can shown from a comparison of the times of contractions before and after the stimulus. The dashed vertical lines indicate the times at which a flexor EMG response would be expected if the stimulus had produced no phase shift from the EMG activity pattern. Before the stimulus, each vertical line is aligned with the onset of a flexor EMG burst, whereas after the stimulus, each vertical line occurs at the end of the flexor burst. Therefore, the stimulus affected the locomotor CPG itself and the FRA interneurons are a critical part of this CPG (see Fig. 9.10C"

The mutant portion of the laminin \u03b3-1 chain is thought to have no other function than to bind nidogen, and does not affect laminin structure or its ability to assemble into the basal lamina. How would you explain these genetic observations, which are summarized in Table Q19\u20131? What would you predict would be the phenotype of a mouse that was homozygous for knockouts of both nidogen genes?"

Some mutations may be lethal, others are less deleterious, and some may confer an evolutionary advantage. Mutations can occur in the germline (sperm or oocytes); these can be transmitted to progeny. Alternatively, mutations can occur during embryogenesis or in somatic tissues. Mutations that occur during development lead to mosaicism, a situation in which tissues are composed of cells with different genetic constitutions. If the germline is mosaic, a mutation can be transmitted to some progeny but not others, which sometimes leads to confusion in assessing the pattern of inheritance. Somatic mutations that do not affect cell survival can sometimes be detected because of variable phenotypic effects in tissues (e.g., pigmented lesions in McCune-Albright syndrome). Other somatic mutations are associated with neoplasia because they confer a growth advantage to cells. Epigenetic events may also influence gene"

The survival rate was 54 percent at 3 years and 40 percent at 7 years. These were significantly greater than had been the case during the period 1965\u20131969. These figures, which were gathered retrospectively, are comparable to more recent ones reported by Bamford and colleagues from patients who had strokes in the 1980s. The mortality rate following cerebral infarcts (no separation being made between thrombotic and embolic types) at the end of 1 month was 19 percent and at the end of 1 year, 23 percent. Of the survivors, 65 percent were capable of an independent existence. In every series, among long-term survivors, heart disease is a more frequent cause of death than additional strokes. It has been repeatedly pointed out that pneumonia as a result of disordered swallowing is a major determinant of survival;"

It is difficult to imagine how such a large amount of genetic material can be effectively packaged into a volume the size of a cell nucleus so that it can be efficiently replicated and its genetic information expressed. To do so requires the interaction of DNA with a large number of proteins, each of which performs a specific function in the ordered packaging of these long molecules of DNA. Eukaryotic DNA is associated with tightly bound basic proteins, called histones. These serve to order the DNA into fundamental structural units, called nucleosomes, which resemble beads on a string. Nucleosomes are further arranged into increasingly more complex structures that organize and condense the long DNA molecules into chromosomes that can be segregated during cell division. [Note: The complex of DNA and protein found inside the nuclei of eukaryotic cells is called chromatin.]"
