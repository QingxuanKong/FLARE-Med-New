The study is conducted to assess the antileukemic activity of a new tyrosine kinase inhibitor in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis. 2. All patients enrolled in the study are informed that they would be treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor. 3. Patients are assigned to successive dose cohorts of 300 to 1000 mg/day of the drug. 4. Six to eight patients are assigned to each dose. 5. Treatment efficacy is determined based on the results of complete blood counts and bone marrow assessments conducted regularly throughout the study. Based on these details, we can conclude that this is a type of clinical trial. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Case-control study: This type of study involves comparing patients with a specific condition (in this case, blast crisis) to patients without the condition to identify potential risk factors. This is not the case here, as the study is focused on evaluating the efficacy of a new treatment. B. Crossover study: In a crossover study, each participant receives all treatment arms (in this case, different dose cohorts of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in a specific order. This is not the case here, as each patient is assigned to a single dose cohort and receives that dose throughout the study. C. Open-labeled clinical trial: In an open-labeled trial, all participants know which treatment they are receiving. This is not the case here, as the patients are not informed of the specific dose they will receive. D. Randomized clinical trial: In a randomized clinical trial, participants are randomly assigned to different treatment groups (in this case, different dose cohorts of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor). This is the correct answer, as patients are randomly assigned to successive dose cohorts. The answer is D. Randomized clinical trial.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, particularly in patients with early disease, induces sustained remissions with manageable toxicity and prevents progression to blast crisis, apparently by suppressing the proliferative drive that leads to the acquisition of additional mutations. When patients on tyrosine kinase inhibitors relapse, their tumors frequently are found to have acquired mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL that prevent the drugs from binding. The selective outgrowth of these cells is explained by the powerful anti-tumor effects of BCR-ABL inhibitors, and indicates that many resistant tumors are still \u201caddicted\u201d to the progrowth signals created by BCR-ABL.

This resistance is usually associated with secondary mutations in the part of the Bcr-Abl gene that encodes the kinase domain, disrupting the ability of imatinib to bind to Bcr-Abl kinase.

It is approved for the treatment of chronicand accelerated-phase CML after failure of two or more TKIs, at 1.25 mg/m2 subcutaneously twice a day for 14 days for induction and for 7 days for consolidation-maintenance. Nilotinib is similar in structure to imatinib but 30 times more potent. Dasatinib and bosutinib are dual SRC-ABL1 TKIs (dasatinib is reported to be 300 times more potent and bosutinib 30\u201350 times more potent than imatinib). Ponatinib is effective against wild-type and mutant BCRABL1 clones. It is unique in being the only currently available BCRABL1 TKI that is active against T315I, a gatekeeper mutant resistant to the other four TKIs (Table 133-2)."

            "content": "After intravenous administration, the drug is cleared rapidly, with most of an administered dose being deaminated to inactive forms. The stoichiometric balance between the level of activation and catabolism of cytarabine is important in determining its eventual cytotoxicity. The clinical activity of cytarabine is highly schedule-dependent and, because of its rapid degradation, it is usually administered via continuous infusion over a 5-to 7-day period. Its activity is limited exclusively to hematologic malignancies, including acute myelogenous leukemia and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. This agent has absolutely no activity in solid tumors. The main adverse effects associated with cytarabine therapy include myelosuppression, mucositis, nausea and vomiting, and neurotoxicity when high-dose therapy is administered."

This allows many patients to undergo allogeneic SCT in a state of minimal CML burden or secondary chronic phase, which are associated with higher cure rates. In CML nonlymphoid blastic phase, anti-AML chemotherapy combined with TKIs results in CR rates of 30\u201350% and median survival times of 9\u201312 months (compared with historical response rates of 20\u201330% and median survival times of 3\u20135 months). In accelerated phase, response to single TKIs is significant in conditions where \u201csofter\u201d accelerated phase criteria are considered (e.g., clonal evolution alone, thrombocytosis alone, significant splenomegaly or resistance to hydroxyurea, but without evidence of high blast and basophil percentages). In accelerated phase, combinations usually include TKIs with low-intensity chemotherapy such as low-dose cytarabine, low-dose"

The single most active agent for AML is cytarabine; however, it is best used in combination with an anthracycline, which leads to complete remissions in about 70% of patients. While there are several anthracyclines that can be effectively combined with cytarabine, idarubicin is preferred."
