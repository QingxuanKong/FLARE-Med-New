    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the available information about informal carers, particularly those providing care to individuals over 65 years old. According to the provided documents, we can look for statistics and statements related to the prevalence and characteristics of informal carers in this demographic.\\n\\nDocument [1] mentions that informal caregivers are usually spouses or children, and as the population ages, the number of caregivers increases. Document [11] states that many countries face dramatic changes in their ratios of working-age individuals to older populations, with a potential drop from 4 to 2 in Western Europe by 2050. However, this information does not directly address the percentage of over 65s providing informal care.\\n\\nDocument [6] does not provide specific statistics on informal carers, but it does discuss the role of informal caregivers in long-term care.\\n\\nDocument [16] discusses the Shortened fatigue questionnaire, which includes a question about the number of hours spent caring for a family member or friend in the last two weeks. However, it does not provide a percentage of caregivers among the over 65 age group.\\n\\nDocument [24] does not mention informal carers specifically, but it discusses glucose transport into cells and the role of insulin in this process.\\n\\nDocument [26] provides information on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 291 diseases and injuries in 21 regions, 1990-2010, but it does not address informal carers.\\n\\nDocument [29] discusses the treatment of Lyme disease and the role of doxycycline, an antibiotic in the tetracycline family, but it does not provide information on informal carers.\\n\\nDocument [30] discusses dependency ratios, which compare the age groups most likely to be in the labor force with those typically dependent on the productive capacity of those working. However, it does not provide specific statistics on informal carers.\\n\\nBased on the available information, we can make an educated guess that the correct answer might be related to the changing demographics and the increasing number of caregivers in the population. Option B, \\\"One in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care,\\\" seems plausible given the context of population aging and the increasing need for long-term care.\\n\\nHowever, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact percentage of over 65s providing informal care. Therefore, the best answer is B. One in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

Although there are many men who provide care, on the population level, informal caregiving is still mainly done by women. Because women live longer than men, lack of a spousal caregiver is especially likely to be a problem for older women. Both men and women have fewer children on whom they can call for informal caregiving, because of the worldwide decline in fertility rates. An increasing proportion of older men in Europe and North America have spent much or all of their adult lives apart from their biological children. Lower fertility"

In the past, it was considered that patients themselves need be told only that they have a condition for which they are to be given rest and treatment. Most physicians (and patients) find this too patronizing; certainly, in the current social environment, patients ask directly if they have Alzheimer disease. To this query, we usually respond that they may, but that more time is required to be certain. Some intelligent patients have insisted on knowing the details and implications of this statement, and we have felt obliged to give as much useful information as required by them."

All of the other statements are true for both insulin and glucagon. 3.2. In which one of the following tissues is glucose transport into the cell insulin dependent? A. Adipose B. Brain C. Liver D. Red blood cells Correct answer = A. The glucose transporter (GLUT-4) in adipose (and muscle) tissue is dependent on insulin. Insulin results in movement of GLUT-4 from intracellular vesicles to the cell membrane. The other tissues in the list contain GLUT that are independent of insulin because they are always located on the cell membrane."

Even though many in some countries do not enter the labor force until significantly older than age 15, retire before age 65, or work past age 65, the ratios do summarize important facts, especially in countries where financial support for the retired comes partially or mainly from those currently in the labor force through either a formal pension system or through informal support from the family. While many countries still have very basic pension systems with incomplete coverage, in Europe public pensions are"
