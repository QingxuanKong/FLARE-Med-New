In these cases, the diagnosis is suggested by cytologic findings in only 33% of cases. Visually suspicious areas in the vagina should be evaluated with a targeted biopsy using the same instruments as those used for cervical biopsies. Careful palpation of the vagina may be helpful in detecting submucosal irregularities. The most common site of vaginal cancer is in the upper one-third of the vagina on the posterior wall. The developing tumor may be missed during initial inspection because of obscured visualization caused by the blades of the speculum (214). Colposcopy is valuable in evaluating patients with abnormal Pap test results, unexplained vaginal bleeding, or ulcerated erythematous patches in the upper vagina. A colposcopically targeted biopsy may not allow a definitive diagnosis,"

Most often, this is postcoital bleeding, but it may occur as irregular or postmenopausal bleeding. Patients with advanced disease may present with a malodorous vaginal discharge, weight loss, or obstructive uropathy. In asymptomatic women, cervical cancer is most commonly identified through evaluation of abnormal cytologic screening tests. The false-negative rate for Pap tests in the presence of invasive cancer is up to 50%, so a negative Pap test should never be relied on in a symptomatic patient (10). Initially, all women suspected of having cervical cancer should have a general physical examination performed to include evaluation of the supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinofemoral lymph Figure 36.1 Gross appearance of cervical cancer on examination."

On pelvic examination, a speculum is inserted into the vagina, and the cervix is inspected for suspicious areas (Fig. 36.1). The vaginal fornices also should be closely inspected. With invasive cancer, the cervix is usually firm and expanded, and these features should be confirmed by digital examination. Rectal examination is important to help establish cervical consistency and size, particularly in patients with endocervical carcinomas. Rectal examination is the only way to determine cervical size if the vaginal fornices have been obliterated by menopausal changes or by the extension of disease. Parametrial extension of disease is best determined by the finding of nodularity beyond the cervix on rectal examination."

Invasive carcinomas often have symptoms or signs including post-coital spotting or intermenstrual cycle bleeding or menometrorrhagia. Foul-smelling or persistent yellow discharge may also be seen. Presentations that include pelvic or sacral pain suggest lateral extension of the tumor into pelvic nerve plexus by either the primary tumor or a pelvic node and are signs of advanced-stage disease. Likewise, flank pain from hydronephrosis from ureteral compression or deep venous thrombosis from iliac vessel compression suggests either extensive nodal disease or direct extension of the primary tumor to the pelvic sidewall.

Occasionally, she may perceive lower abdominal distention, pressure, or pain, such as dyspareunia. Acute symptoms, such as pain secondary to rupture or torsion, are unusual. In advanced-stage disease, patients have symptoms related to the presence of ascites, omental metastases, or bowel metastases. The symptoms include abdominal distention, bloating, constipation, nausea, anorexia, or early satiety. Premenopausal women may report irregular or heavy menses, whereas vaginal bleeding may occur in postmenopausal women (86)."

            "content": "Figure 36.9 Pelvic exenteration specimen. Surgical mortality increases with age, and the operation should rarely be considered in a patient who is older than 70 years. Other medical illnesses should be taken into account. When life expectancy is limited, exenterative surgery is unwise. Anterior Exenteration Candidates for anterior exenteration are those in whom the disease is limited to the cervix and anterior portion of the upper vagina. Proctoscopic examination should be performed because a positive finding would mandate a total exenteration. However, a negative proctoscopic examination finding does not exclude disease in the rectal muscularis, and findings at laparotomy still must be considered. The presence of disease in the posterior vaginal mucosa directly over the rectum mandates removal of the underlying rectum."

            "content": "Diagnosis The diagnostic workup includes a complete history and physical examination, careful speculum examination and palpation of the vagina, and bimanual pelvic and rectal examinations. It is important to rotate the speculum to obtain a careful view of the entire vagina because posterior wall lesions frequently occur and may be overlooked."

A colposcopically targeted biopsy may not allow a definitive diagnosis, and a partial vaginectomy may be necessary to determine invasion. Occult invasive carcinoma may be detected by such an excision, particularly in patients who have a history of prior hysterectomy in whom the vaginal vault closure may bury some of the vaginal epithelium at risk for cancer (215)."

            "content": "A careful inspection of the vulva should be part of every gynecologic examination. On physical examination, vulvar carcinoma is usually raised and may be \ufb02eshy, ulcerated, plaquelike or warty in appearance. It may be pigmented, red or white, and tender or painless. The lesion may be clinically indistinct, especially in the presence of VIN or vulvar dystrophies (12). Any lesion of the vulva warrants a biopsy. Most squamous carcinomas of the vulva occur on the labia majora and minora (60%), but the clitoris (15%) and perineum (10%) may be primary sites. Approximately 10% of the cases are too extensive to determine a site of origin, and about 5% of the cases are multifocal."

            "content": "Pathology Cancer of the vagina spreads most often by direct extension into the pelvic soft tissues and adjacent organs. Metastases to the pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes may occur in advanced disease. Lesions in the lower one-third of the vagina may spread directly to the inguinal femoral lymph nodes and the pelvic nodes (216). Hematogenous dissemination to the lungs, liver, or bone may occur as a late phenomenon. Squamous cell carcinomas are the most common form of vaginal cancer, occurring in 80% to 90% of cases. These tumors most commonly occur in the upper one-third, posterior wall of the vagina. The mean age of patients with squamous cell cancer is 60 years (217,218). Malignant melanoma is the second most common cancer of the vagina, accounting for 2.8% to 5% of all vaginal neoplasms (219\u2013221). Other histologic subtypes include adenocarcinoma and sarcoma."
