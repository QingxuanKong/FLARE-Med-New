Let's evaluate each option given: Option A, the gastric parietal cells, is incorrect because they primarily secrete gastric acid and intrinsic factor, not insulin. Option C, the walls of the large intestine, is also incorrect because the large intestine is primarily involved in water absorption and storage of waste, not hormone secretion. Option D, the autonomic nervous system, is incorrect because while the autonomic nervous system can regulate various bodily functions, it does not secrete insulin. Option B, the pancreas, is correct because the pancreas is an organ that contains islet cells, which include beta cells that secrete insulin. The pancreas is a dual-function gland, with an exocrine function (producing digestive enzymes) and an endocrine function (producing hormones such as insulin and glucagon). Insulin is a key hormone that regulates blood glucose levels, and it is primarily secreted by the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

The relative amounts of glucagon and insulin released are normally regulated such that the rate of hepatic glucose production is kept equal to the use of glucose by peripheral tissues. This maintains blood glucose between 70 and 140 mg/dl. In view of its coordinating role, it is not surprising that the \u03b2 cell responds to a variety of stimuli.

The increase in insulin drives glucose uptake by tissues such as muscle and adipose that have insulin-dependent glucose transporters, resulting in hypoglycemia. However, the hypoglycemia is insufficient to suppress insulin production and secretion. Insulinomas, then, are characterized by increased blood insulin and decreased blood glucose.

            "content": "The endocrine pancreas consists of the islets of Langerhans, which contain four major cell types\u2014beta, alpha, delta, and PP (pancreatic polypeptide) cells. The beta cell produces insulin, which regulates glucose utilization in tissues and reduces blood glucose levels, as will be detailed in the discussion of diabetes; the alpha cell secretes glucagon, which raises glucose levels through its glycogenolytic activity in the liver; delta cells secrete somatostatin, which suppresses both insulin and glucagon release; and PP cells secrete pancreatic polypeptide, which exerts several gastrointestinal effects, such as stimulation of secretion of gastric and intestinal enzymes and inhibition of intestinal motility. The most important disease of the endocrine pancreas is diabetes mellitus, caused by deficient production or action of insulin."

            "content": "The liver and kidney are the two main organs that remove insulin from the circulation. The liver normally clears the blood of approximately 60% of the insulin released from the pancreas by virtue of its location as the terminal site of portal vein blood flow, with the kidney removing 35\u201340% of the endogenous hormone. However, in insulin-treated diabetics receiving subcutaneous insulin injections, this ratio is reversed, with as much as 60% of exogenous insulin being cleared by the kidney and the liver removing no more than 30\u201340%. The half-life of circulating insulin is 3\u20135 minutes. Basal serum insulin values of 5\u201315 \u03bcU/mL (30\u201390 pmol/L) are found in normal humans, with a peak rise to 60\u201390 \u03bcU/mL (360\u2013540 pmol/L) during meals. The Insulin Receptor"

Unextracted insulin enters the FIGURE 417-5 Mechanisms of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and abnormalities in diabetes. Glucose and other nutrients regulate insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta cell. Glucose is transported by a glucose transporter (GLUT1 and/or GLUT2 in humans, GLUT2 in rodents); subsequent glucose metabolism by the beta cell alters ion channel activity, leading to insulin secretion. The SUR receptor is the binding site for some drugs that act as insulin secretagogues. Mutations in the events or proteins underlined are a cause of monogenic forms of diabetes.
