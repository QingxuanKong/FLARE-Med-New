    "question": "A 63-year-old woman is in the hospital recovery room 4 hours after elective left hemicolectomy for colon carcinoma at the splenic flexure. She has a preoperative written directive for no blood products through transfusion for religious reasons. Medical history is significant for hypertension and coronary artery disease. The nurse tells you the patient's blood pressure has progressively declined since the operation. Vital signs now are temperature 35.8\u00b0C (96.4\u00b0F), pulse 130/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses a slightly distended abdomen with an intact incision. ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Urine output has been 10 mL during the past 2 hours. Hematocrit is 30%; preoperative hematocrit was 41%. The patient has received 4 L of intravenous crystalloid in the recovery room. Reported operative blood loss was 200 mL. Drainage from the nasogastric tube is clear. Damage to which of the following structures is most likely responsible for these findings?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and clinical findings in the context of her recent surgery and medical history. The patient has a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease, which may make her more susceptible to hypotension and shock. She has a low hematocrit (30%) and low urine output (10 mL/hour), which suggests hypovolemic shock. The patient has received 4 L of intravenous crystalloid, but her blood pressure has continued to decline. The nasogastric tube drainage is clear, which makes gastrointestinal bleeding less likely. The patient's ECG shows sinus tachycardia, which is consistent with hypovolemic shock. The distended abdomen with an intact incision and the patient's symptoms suggest that the bleeding is likely internal. Given the patient's history of hypertension and coronary artery disease, we need to consider vascular structures that could be responsible for the bleeding. The epigastric artery is a possible source of bleeding, as it is a branch of the superior mesenteric artery that supplies blood to the upper abdominal organs, including the spleen and stomach. The liver and middle colic artery are also possible sources of bleeding, but the patient's symptoms and signs are more consistent with bleeding from a vascular structure rather than a solid organ. The spleen is also a possible source of bleeding, but it is not as likely given the patient's symptoms and signs. Therefore, the most likely structure responsible for the patient's findings is the epigastric artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

In a more stable patient, a chest radiograph may be obtained to look for evidence of hemothorax. Major retroperitoneal hem-orrhage typically occurs in association with pelvic fractures, which is confirmed by pelvic radiography in the resuscitation bay. Intraperitoneal hemorrhage is probably the most common source of blood loss that induces shock. The physical exam for detection of substantial blood loss or injury is insensitive and unreliable; large volumes of intraperitoneal blood may be present before physical examination findings are apparent.

Loss of up to 15% of the circulat-ing volume (700 to 750 mL for a 70-kg patient) may produce little in terms of obvious symptoms, while loss of up to 30% of the circulating volume (1.5 L) may result in mild tachycar-dia, tachypnea, and anxiety.

Vigorous massage is used to force the air bubbles through the coronary arteries; if this is unsuccessful, a tuber-culin syringe is used to aspirate air bubbles from the coronary artery (most common is the right). Once circulation is restored, the patient should be kept in Trendelenburg\u2019s position with the pulmonary hilum clamped until the pulmonary venous injury is controlled operatively.Persistent hypotension due to uncontrolled hemorrhage is associated with high mortality. A rapid search for the source or sources of hemorrhage includes visual inspection with knowledge of the injury mechanism, eFAST, and chest and pelvic radiographs. During diagnostic evaluation, type O RBCs (O-negative for women of childbearing age) and thawed AB plasma should be administered at a ratio of 2:1. Type-specific RBCs should be administered as"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

The cause is unknown, but gallblad-der distention, bile stasis, and ischemia have been implicated as causative factors. After resection, pathologic examination of the gallbladder wall after an episode of acalculous cholecystitis reveals edema of the serosa and muscular layers, with patchy thrombosis of arterioles and venules.65The ability to recognize the symptoms and signs of acalculous cholecystitis can depend on the condition and mental status of the patient, but acalculous cholecystitis can be similar to acute calculous cholecystitis, with right upper quadrant pain and tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis. In the sedated or unconscious patient, the clinical features are often masked, but fever and elevated WBC count, as well as"

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

There are also reports of splenic injuries after endoscopic procedures, such as colonoscopy.Improper traction on the spleen against its peritoneal attachments is the most common mechanism of intraopera-tive injury. Capsular tears are the most common type of injury, but parenchymal lacerations and subcapsular hematomas also occur. The lower pole is more commonly injured, owing to its orientation and the greater concentration of peritoneal attach-ments found here.As with all hemorrhage, prompt temporary control of bleeding should be obtained by direct compression of the spleen itself, packing of the left upper quadrant, compression of the vessels at the splenic hilum, or pressure on the splenic artery at the superior pancreatic margin. The spleen should then be mobi-lized from its peritoneal"

Once the cycle starts, each component magnifies the other, which leads to a down-ward spiral and ultimately a fatal arrhythmia. The purpose of DCS is to limit operative time so that the patient can be returned to the SICU for physiologic restoration and the cycle thereby broken. Indications to limit the initial operation and institute DCS techniques include a combination of refractory hypother-mia (temperature <35\u00b0C), profound acidosis (arterial pH <7.2, base deficit >15 mmol/L), and refractory coagulopathy.56,77 The decision to abbreviate a trauma laparotomy is made intraopera-tively as the patient\u2019s clinical course becomes clearer and labo-ratory values become available.The goal of DCS is to control surgical bleeding and limit GI spillage.

The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"
