The object is resting on a plane with an angle of incline, an acceleration due to gravity (g), and a coefficient of friction (\u00b5) between the object and the plane. The force of gravity acting on the object is Fg = mg sin?, where m is the mass of the object and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The force of friction acting on the object is Ff = \u00b5N, where N is the normal force acting on the object. Since the object is resting on the plane, the normal force is equal to the component of the weight of the object perpendicular to the plane, which is mg cos?. Therefore, the force of friction is Ff = \u00b5mg cos?. The net force acting on the object is the sum of the force of gravity and the force of friction, which is Fnet = Fg - Ff = mg (sin? - \u00b5 cos?). Using Newton's second law of motion, we can write Fnet = ma, where m is the mass of the object and a is its acceleration. Equating the two expressions for Fnet, we get mg (sin? - \u00b5 cos?) = ma. Dividing both sides by m, we get a = g (sin? - \u00b5 cos?).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

They include pelvic tilt in the coronal plane, pelvic rotation in the transverse plane, movement of the knees toward the midline, flexion of the knees, and complex interactions between the hip, knee, and ankle. As a result, during walking, the body\u2019s center of gravity normally fluctuates only 5 cm in both vertical and lateral directions. The bones of the gluteal region and the thigh are the pelvic bone and the femur (Fig. 6.8). The large ball and socket joint between these two bones is the hip joint."

Continuous afferent impulses from the eyes, labyrinths, muscles, and joints inform us of the position of different parts of the body. In response to these impulses, the adaptive movements necessary to maintain equilibrium are carried out. Normally, we are unaware of these adjustments because they operate largely at a reflex level. The most important of the afferent impulses are the following. 1. Visual information from the retinae and possibly proprioceptive impulses from the ocular muscles, enable us to judge the distance of objects from the body. This information is coordinated with sensory information from the labyrinths and neck (see the following text) to stabilize gaze during movements of the head and body. 2."

For example, to make a reaching movement with your arm, you must first identify the target (or goal) and locate it in external space. Next, a limb trajectory must be determined on the basis of an internal representation of your arm and, in particular, your hand in relation to the target. Finally, a set of forces necessary to generate the desired trajectory must be computed. This process is often thought of as a series of transformations between coordinate systems. For example, the location of a visually identified target is measured in a retinotopic space, but its location is perceived in an external or world space (i.e., the position of a nonmoving target is perceived as stable, even when the eye, and thus the target\u2019s image on the retina, changes). Next, calculation of a trajectory would involve a body-or hand-centered system, and finally, forces must ultimately be computed in a muscle-based reference frame."

Tissues are damaged when energy is dissipated at the interface between air and liquid that presents a change in acoustic impedance. The subsequent blast wind is the source of separate injury, throwing people against fixed objects and dispersing projectiles that penetrate the body. Potential modes of conduction of the force of the blast to the cranial contents include the acceleration and deceleration of the head as a wave passes by, which essentially results in concussion; skull deformation which squeezes the brain; the indirect passage of the shock wave through the lungs; and the entry of the wave through the openings in the cranial vault,"

In comparison with the movement that limbs, with their multiple joints and muscles, can perform, eye movement is relatively simple. For example, each eye is controlled by only three agonistantagonist muscle pairs: the medial and lateral recti, the superior and inferior recti, and the superior and inferior oblique muscles. These muscles allow the eye to rotate about three axes. Assuming that the head is in an upright position, the axes are the vertical axis, a horizontal axis that runs left to right, and the torsional axis (which is directed along the axis of sight). The medial and lateral recti control movement about the vertical axis; the other four muscles generate movement about the horizontal and torsional axes. Another simplifying feature is that there are no external loads for which to be compensated. Furthermore, eye movement appears to be separable into a few distinct types, with each type"

The unstable center of gravity that prevails in walking must shift within narrow limits from side to side and forward as the weight is borne first on one foot, then on the other. This is accomplished through the activity of highly sensitive postural and righting reflexes that have both peripheral (stretch reflexes) and central (vestibulocerebellar reflexes) components.

In reality, people are not consciously aware of their center of mass, but everyone (particularly gymnasts, figure skaters, and platform divers, for example) move so as to manage it. Disorders of balance present as difficulty maintaining posture while standing and walking and as a subjective sense of disequilibrium, which is a form of dizziness. The cerebellum and vestibular system organize antigravity responses needed to maintain an upright posture. These responses are physiologically complex, and the anatomic representation they entail is not well understood.

An example of the former occurs when you are sitting in a train and a train on the adjacent track begins moving: Your eyes rotate to keep the image of the neighboring car stable.

            "content": "The mechanics of a typical concussion involve sudden deceleration of the head when hitting a blunt stationary object. This creates an anterior-posterior movement of the brain within the skull due to inertia and rotation of the cerebral hemispheres on the fulcrum of the relatively fixed upper brainstem. Loss of consciousness in concussion is believed to result from a transient electrophysiologic dysfunction of the reticular activating system in the upper midbrain that is at the site of rotation (Chap. 328). The transmission of a wave of kinetic energy throughout the brain is an alternative explanation for the disruption in consciousness."

            "content": "The method is useful in detecting nucleic acids, specifically the purine and pyrimidine bases of the nucleotides. It is also useful for detecting proteins that contain certain amino acids. Using specific illuminating wavelengths, UV spectrophotometric measurements are commonly made through the UV microscope to determine quantitatively the amount of DNA and RNA in individual cells. As described in the Folder 1.2 on page 7, Feulgen microspectrophoto metry is used clinically to evaluate the degree of ploidy (multiples of normal DNA quantity) in sections of tumors. The polarizing microscope uses the fact that highly ordered molecules or arrays of molecules can rotate the angle of the plane of polarized light. The polarizing microscope is a simple modification of the light microscope in which a polarizing filter (the polarizer) is located between the light source and the specimen, and a second polarizer (the analyzer) is located between the objective lens and the viewer."
