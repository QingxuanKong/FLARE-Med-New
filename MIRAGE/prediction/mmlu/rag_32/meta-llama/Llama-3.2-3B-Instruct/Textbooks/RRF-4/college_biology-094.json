Covalent modification Many enzymes are regulated by covalent modification, most often by the addition or removal of phosphate groups from specific serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues of the enzyme. Protein phosphorylation is recognized as one of the primary ways in which cellular processes are regulated. 1. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation: Phosphorylation reactions are catalyzed by a family of enzymes called protein kinases that use ATP as the phosphate donor. Phosphate groups are cleaved from phosphorylated enzymes by the action of phosphoprotein phosphatases (Fig. 5.18). 2."

Correct answer = B. The CYP enzymes hydroxylate hydrophobic compounds, making them more water soluble. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) from the pentose phosphate pathway is the electron donor. Both the CYP enzymes and the nitric oxide synthase isozymes contain heme. 3.4. In male patients who are hemizygous for X-linked glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, pathophysiologic consequences are more apparent in red blood cells (RBC) than in other cells such as in the liver. Which one of the following provides the most reasonable explanation for this different response? A. Excess glucose 6-phosphate in the liver, but not in RBC, can be channeled to glycogen, thereby averting cellular damage."

If the antigen is on the surface of a pathogen or is a soluble macromolecule with two or more identical antigenic determinants (as shown), it cross-links adjacent Bcrs, causing them and their associated invariant chains to cluster, as shown. A Src-like cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (which can be Fyn or Lyn) is associated with the cytosolic tail of Ig\u03b2; it joins the cluster and phosphorylates both the Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 invariant chains (for simplicity, only the phosphorylation on Ig\u03b2 is shown). A transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase called CD45 is also required to remove inactivating phosphates from these Src-like kinases (not shown). The resulting phosphotyrosines on Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 serve as docking sites for another Src-like tyrosine kinase called Syk, which becomes phosphorylated and thereby activated to relay the signal downstream."
