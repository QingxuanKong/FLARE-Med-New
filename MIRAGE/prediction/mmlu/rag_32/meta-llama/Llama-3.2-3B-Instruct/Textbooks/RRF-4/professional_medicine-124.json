    "question": "A 24-year-old recent college graduate comes to the office because of a 3-year history of increased frequency of urination and occasional incontinence whenever she travels. She says the urinary symptoms typically begin a few days before she is going to fly and they stop the day after she arrives at her destination. She says she is anxious about flying and even slightly \"panicky.\" She reports having had similar but milder symptoms prior to examinations before graduating. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Urinalysis and urine culture are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 3-year history of increased frequency of urination and occasional incontinence that occurs before air travel, but resolves after arrival. This pattern is characteristic of stress urinary incontinence, which is often exacerbated by anxiety and stress. Given the patient's history of anxiety and the onset of symptoms before flying, it is likely that her symptoms are related to performance anxiety. The patient's symptoms are not indicative of a urinary tract infection or other underlying medical condition, as evidenced by normal urinalysis and urine culture results. Behavioral therapy is a common treatment approach for stress urinary incontinence, particularly for patients with performance anxiety. This type of therapy can help the patient manage her anxiety and reduce her symptoms. The other options do not directly address the likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

The history should include a review of symptoms, general medical history, review of past surgery, and current medications. The woman\u2019s most troubling symptoms must be ascertained\u2014how often she leaks urine, how much urine she leaks, what provokes urine loss, what improves or worsens the problem, and what treatment (if any) she had in the past. It is essential to keep the patient\u2019s chief symptom at the forefront to avoid inappropriate management. Consider, for example, a woman whose chief concern is that once a month, while leading a business seminar, she has a sudden, overwhelming urge to void followed by complete bladder emptying. She finds this leakage devastating and is considering quitting her job because of her acute embarrassment. On occasion, she leaks a few drops of urine during exercise, but this minor leakage does not bother her. During the evaluation, urodynamics reveal minimal stress"

She has urge incontinence, likely caused by the relatively larger bladder volumes voided at night, which in turn may be related to her greater \ufb02uid, caffeine, and alcohol consumption in the evening."

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a"

            "content": "When confronted with an abnormal urinalysis and elevated serum creatinine, with or without edema or congestive heart failure, one must consider whether the glomerulonephritis is acute or chronic. This assessment is best made by careful history (last known urinalysis or serum creatinine during pregnancy or insurance physical, evidence of infection, or use of medication or recreational drugs); the size of the kidneys on renal ultrasound examination; and how the patient feels at presentation. Chronic glomerular disease often presents with decreased kidney size. Patients who quickly develop renal failure are fatigued and weak and often have uremic symptoms associated with nausea, vomiting, fluid retention, and somnolence. Primary glomerulonephritis presenting with renal failure that has progressed slowly, however, can be remarkably asymptomatic, as are patients with acute glomerulonephritis without much loss in renal function. Once this initial information is collected, selected patients"

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

In particular, the duration, severity, and consistency of the symptoms are important, along with the patient\u2019s estimate of the consequences of the sleep disorder on waking function. Information from a bed partner or family member is often helpful because some patients may be unaware of symptoms such as heavy snoring or may underreport symptoms such as falling asleep at work or while driving. Physicians should inquire about when the patient typically goes to bed, when they fall asleep and wake up, whether they awaken during sleep, whether they feel rested in the morning, and whether they nap during the day. Depending on the primary complaint, it may be useful to ask about snoring, witnessed apneas, restless sensations in the legs, movements during sleep, depression, anxiety, and behaviors around the sleep episode. The physical exam may provide evidence of a small airway, large tonsils, or a neurologic or medical disorder that contributes to the"
