        "A": "Blood smear",

    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking for the given question: **Step 1: Identify the key clinical features of the patient's presentation** The patient is a 14-year-old girl with nausea, intermittent diarrhea, and a 2.2-kg (5-lb) weight loss over the past 4 weeks. She also presents with a migrating serpiginous pruritic perianal rash. **Step 2: Consider the differential diagnosis based on the clinical features** The presence of a serpiginous pruritic perianal rash, along with gastrointestinal symptoms, suggests an infection that involves the perianal region. **Step 3: Evaluate the options for diagnostic tests** - **A. Blood smear**: This test is typically used to diagnose hematological disorders, such as anemia or leukemia. While it may show eosinophilia, it is not specific for diagnosing the condition described. - **B. Bone marrow biopsy**: This test is also used to diagnose hematological disorders and is not directly relevant to the patient's perianal rash and gastrointestinal symptoms. - **C. KOH preparation**: This test is used to diagnose fungal infections, such as ringworm. The presence of a serpiginous pruritic perianal rash is consistent with a fungal infection, specifically pinworm infection. - **D. Microscopic examination of the stool**: While this test can show parasites, it is not the most specific test for diagnosing pinworm infection. **Step 4: Choose the most likely diagnostic test** Based on the clinical presentation of a serpiginous pruritic perianal rash, the most likely diagnosis is pinworm infection. The KOH preparation is the most specific test for diagnosing pinworm infection. The final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient most likely has pinworm infection, which is diagnosed by a KOH preparation. This test is the most specific for diagnosing pinworm infection, which is characterized by a serpiginous pruritic perianal rash and gastrointestinal symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The proglottids are often motile, and patients may experience perianal discomfort when proglottids are discharged. Mild abdominal pain or discomfort, nausea, change in appetite, weakness, and weight loss can occur. Diagnosis The diagnosis is made by the detection of eggs or proglottids in the stool. Eggs may also be present in the perianal area; thus, if proglottids or eggs are not found in the stool, the perianal region should be examined with use of a cellophane-tape swab (as in pinworm infection; Chap. 257). Distinguishing T. saginata or T. asiatica from T. solium requires examination of mature proglottids. All three species can be distinguished by examining the scolex. Available serologic tests are not helpful diagnostically. Eosinophilia and elevated levels of serum IgE may be detected. A single dose of praziquantel (10 mg/kg) is highly effective."

Eosinophilia is practically always present in the peripheral blood (>700 cells/mm3), although the sedimentation rate is often normal. The CK level is moderately elevated. A skin test using Trichinella antigen is available, but it is unreliable. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) blood test is more accurate, but it becomes positive only after 1 or 2 weeks of illness. Biopsy of almost any muscle (usually the deltoid or gastrocnemius), regardless of whether it is painful or tender, is probably the most reliable confirmatory test. More than 500 mg of muscle may be required to demonstrate larvae, but smaller specimens will almost invariably show an inflammatory myopathy. Muscle fibers undergo segmental necrosis, and the interstitial inflammatory infiltrates contain a predominance of eosinophils. This accounts for the edema, pain, and tenderness of heavily infested"

Recurrent urticaria, often 1415 involving the buttocks and wrists, is the most common cutaneous manifestation. Migrating larvae can elicit a pathognomonic serpiginous eruption, larva currens (\u201crunning larva\u201d). This pruritic, raised, erythematous lesion advances as rapidly as 10 cm/h along the course of larval migration. Adult parasites burrow into the duodenojejunal mucosa and can cause abdominal (usually midepigastric) pain, which resembles peptic ulcer pain except that it is aggravated by food ingestion. Nausea, diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, mild chronic colitis, and weight loss can occur. Small-bowel obstruction may develop with early, heavy infection. Pulmonary symptoms are rare in uncomplicated strongyloidiasis. Eosinophilia is common, with levels fluctuating over time."

Heavy infections have been alleged to cause abdominal pain and weight loss. On rare occasions, pinworms invade the female genital tract, causing vulvovaginitis and pelvic or peritoneal granulomas. Eosinophilia is uncommon. Diagnosis Since pinworm eggs are not released in feces, the diagnosis cannot be made by conventional fecal ova and parasite tests. Instead, eggs are detected by the application of clear cellulose acetate tape to the perianal region in the morning.

Extreme eosinophilia suggests a nonallergic disorder such as infections with tissue-invasive parasites, drug reactions, or malignancies (Table 77-3). A classic example of a type IV reaction is the tuberculin skin test. A small amount of purified protein derivative from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is injected intradermally (see Chapter 124). In a previously sensitized individual, a type IV inflammatory reaction (induration) develops over the next 24 to 72 hours."

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms. Of note, he has no other illnesses. What is this patient\u2019s overall prognosis? Based on his prognosis, what"

Small bowel involvement in CD is associated with loss of appetite, crampy postprandial pain, poor growth, delayed puberty, fever, anemia, and lethargy. Some symptoms may be present for some time before the diagnosis is made. Severe CD with fibrosis may cause partial or complete small bowel obstruction. Perineal abnormalities, including skin tags and fistulas, are another feature distinguishing CD from UC. Other extraintestinal manifestations of CD include arthritis, erythema nodosum, and uveitis or iritis. Blood tests should include complete blood count, albumin,erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein(Table 129-2). Anemia and elevated platelet counts are typical. Testing for abnormal serum antibodies can be helpfulin diagnosing IBD and in discriminating between the colitis of CD and UC. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody is found in about 66% of UC patients and in only a few CD"

It is more common in patients with CD4+ T cell counts <200 cells/\u03bcL. Pruritic papular eruption is one of the most common pruritic rashes in patients with HIV infection. It appears as multiple papules on the face, trunk, and extensor surfaces and may improve with cART. Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis is a rare form of folliculitis that is seen with increased frequency in patients with HIV infection. It presents as multiple, urticarial perifollicular papules that may coalesce into plaquelike lesions. Skin biopsy reveals an eosinophilic infiltrate of the hair follicle, which in certain cases has been associated with the presence of a mite. Patients typically have an elevated serum IgE level and may respond to treatment with topical anthelmintics. Pruritus is a common symptom in patients with HIV infection and can lead to prurigo nodularis. Patients with HIV"

The diagnosis of IBS is usually based on history and physical examination, and although suggestive, especially in young women, the findings are not specific. A CBC, thyroid function study, stool sample to test for white cells and occult blood, and sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy or barium enema are usually required, particularly in older individuals and in young individuals who have not responded to initial treatment. The results of these studies are all normal in patients with IBS."

The resulting Rome III criteria are: recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort for at least 3 days per month for 3 months associated with two or more of the following: Improvement with defecation Onset associated with a change in frequency of stool Onset associated with a change in the appearance of the stool IBS should be a diagnosis of exclusion with consideration initially given to other causes for the dominant symptom. If that is diarrhea, considerations of lactose intolerance, infectious etiology, malabsorption, or celiac disease should be entertained. Symptoms that result in weight loss, rectal bleeding, anemia, or that are noctural or progressive could indicate something other than IBS unless proven otherwise."

He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"
