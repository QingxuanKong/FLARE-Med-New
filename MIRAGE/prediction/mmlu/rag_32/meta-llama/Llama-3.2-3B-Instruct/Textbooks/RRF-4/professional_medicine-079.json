    "question": "A 55-year-old man who is a business executive is admitted to the hospital for evaluation of abdominal pain. He is polite to the physician but berates the nurses and other staff. The patient's wife and two of his three adult children arrive for a visit. The patient says with disgust that the missing child is and always has been worthless.

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the behavior of the patient and understand the psychological concepts presented in the options. The patient is polite to the physician but berates the nurses and other staff, which suggests that he is expressing negative feelings towards the people he perceives as being more vulnerable or powerless. The patient also expresses extreme dislike for one of his children, calling them worthless. This behavior is a defense mechanism where the patient redirects his unacceptable feelings towards someone else, in this case, the child. The defense mechanism that best explains this behavior is projection. Projection is a psychological defense mechanism where an individual attributes their unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or motives to someone else. In this case, the patient is projecting his negative feelings towards his child onto the nurses and other staff, and his extreme dislike for the child onto his wife and other family members. The other options, projective identification, reaction formation, and splitting, do not accurately describe the behavior of the patient in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung.

The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast.

Hospitalized patients find themselves surrounded by air jets, buttons, and glaring lights; invaded by tubes and wires; and beset by the numerous members of the health care team\u2014hospitalists, specialists, nurses, nurses\u2019 aides, physicians\u2019 assistants, social workers, technologists, physical therapists, medical students, house officers, attending and consulting physicians, and many others. They may be transported to special laboratories and imaging facilities replete with blinking lights, strange sounds, and unfamiliar personnel; they may be left unattended at times; and they may be obligated to share a room with other patients who have their own health problems. It is little wonder that a patient\u2019s sense of reality may be compromised. Physicians who appreciate the hospital experience from the patient\u2019s perspective and who make an effort to develop a strong relationship"

Although more costly, lurasidone is then prescribed, which, over the course of several weeks of treatment, improves his symptoms and is tolerated by the patient. What signs and symptoms would support an initial diagnosis of schizophrenia? In the treatment of schizophre-nia, what benefits do the second-generation antipsychotic drugs offer over the traditional agents such as haloperidol? In addition to the management of schizophrenia, what other clinical indications warrant consideration of the use of drugs nominally classified as antipsychotics?

He destroyed a TV because he felt the TV was sending harassing messages to him. In addition, he reports hearing voices telling him that fam-ily members are trying to poison his food.

The physiologic stability of the patient may be abnormal with acute blood loss and acute hemolysis, manifesting as tachycardia, blood pressure changes, and, most ominously, an altered state of consciousness. The presence of jaundice suggests hemolysis. Petechiae and purpura indicate a coagulopathy. Hepatosplenomegaly and adenopathy suggest infiltrative disorders. Growth failure or poor weight gain suggests an anemia of chronic disease. An essential element of the physical examination is the investigation of the stool for the presence of occult blood."

A treatment goal for the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) caused by acute bronchitis is to insure appropriate nutrition without increasing the respiratory quotient (RQ), which is the ratio of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced to oxygen consumed, thereby minimizing the production of CO2. Less CO2 is produced from the metabolism of fat (RQ = 0.7) than from the catabolism of carbohydrate (RQ =1.0). Fat contains fewer oxygen atoms. Fat is calorically denser than is carbohydrate.

If asked whether the paralyzed arm has been moved, the patient may say \u201cyes.\u201d If the fact that the arm has not been moved is pointed out, the patient may admit that the arm is slightly weak. If told it is paralyzed, the patient may deny that this is so or offer an excuse: \u201cMy shoulder hurts.\u201d If asked why the paralysis went unnoticed, the response may be, \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor.\u201d Some patients report that they feel as though their left side had disappeared, and when shown the paralyzed arm, they deny it is theirs and assert that it belongs to someone else or even take hold of it and fling it aside. The mildest form of anosognosia is reflected by an imperfect and reduced appreciation of the degree of weakness. On the other extreme of the conceptual negation of paralysis are instances of self-mutilation of the paralyzed limb (apotemnophilia). It should be pointed"
