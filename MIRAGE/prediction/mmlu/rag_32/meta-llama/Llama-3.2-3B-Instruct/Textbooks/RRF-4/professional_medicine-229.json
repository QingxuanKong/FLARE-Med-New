    "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician because of easy bruising for 4 months. She has a history of lung cancer treated with radiation therapy 6 months ago. She has a 2-year history of hypertension treated with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no abnormalities except for multiple ecchymoses. Her hemoglobin concentration is 13 g/dL, leukocyte count is 5000/mm3 , and platelet count is 35,000/mm3 . A serum antiplatelet antibody assay is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with easy bruising, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and a history of lung cancer treated with radiation therapy. The presence of antiplatelet antibodies is negative, making autoimmune thrombocytopenia less likely. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a bleeding disorder, and the history of lung cancer treated with radiation therapy raises the suspicion of T-cell lymphoma with thrombocytopenia, also known as TTP-like syndrome. The patient's age and history of cancer treatment also make T-cell lymphoma a consideration. A CT scan of the abdomen is the most appropriate next step to evaluate for lymphoma in the abdomen, which is a common site for lymphoma involvement. This is followed by a CT scan of the chest to evaluate for mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which is also a common site for lymphoma. Bronchoscopy and bone marrow aspiration may also be considered, but they are not the next best steps in this scenario. A CT scan of the abdomen is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The overall health of the patient and whether he or she is receiving drug treatment will influence the differential diagnosis. A healthy young adult with thrombocytopenia will have a much more limited differential diagnosis than an ill hospitalized patient who is receiving multiple medications. Except in unusual inherited disorders, decreased platelet production usually results from bone marrow disorders that also affect red blood cell (RBC) and/or white blood cell (WBC) production. Because myelodysplasia can present with isolated thrombocytopenia, the bone marrow should be examined in patients presenting with isolated thrombocytopenia who are older than 60 years of age. While inherited thrombocytopenia is rare, any prior platelet counts should be retrieved and a family history regarding"

His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic.

            "content": "low birth weight, and preexisting renal injury. Kidney biopsies in patients with hypertension, microhematuria, and moderate proteinuria demonstrate arteriolosclerosis, chronic nephrosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis in the absence of immune deposits (see Fig. 62e-21). Today, based on a careful history, physical examination, urinalysis, and some serologic testing, the diagnosis of chronic nephrosclerosis is usually inferred without a biopsy. Treating hypertension is the best way to avoid progressive renal failure; most guidelines recommend lowering blood pressure to <130/80 mmHg if there is preexisting diabetes or kidney disease. In the presence of kidney disease, most patients begin antihypertensive therapy with two drugs, classically a thiazide diuretic and an ACE inhibitor; most will require three drugs. There is strong evidence in African Americans with hypertensive nephrosclerosis that therapy initiated with an ACE inhibitor can slow the rate of decline in renal function"

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

Renal function should be evaluated and urinalysis conducted because of the possibility of pulmonary-renal syndromes presenting with hemoptysis. The documentation of acute renal insufficiency or the detection of red blood cells or their casts on urinalysis should elevate suspicion of small-vessel vasculitis, and studies such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, antiglomerular basement membrane antibody, and antinuclear antibody should be considered. If a patient is producing sputum, Gram\u2019s and acid-fast staining as well as culture should be undertaken. If all of these studies are unrevealing, bronchoscopy should be considered. In any patient with a history of cigarette smoking, airway inspection should be part of the evaluation of new-onset hemoptysis as endobronchial lesions are not reliably visualized on CT."
