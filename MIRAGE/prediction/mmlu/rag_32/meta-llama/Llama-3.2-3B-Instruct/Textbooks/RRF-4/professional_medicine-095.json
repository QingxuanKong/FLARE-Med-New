    "question": "A 49-year-old man, who is recovering in the hospital 2 days after uncomplicated left femoral-popliteal bypass grafting for claudication, has now developed increasing pain in his left foot. Until now, the patient's postoperative course had been unremarkable and he has been treated with low-dose morphine for pain control. Medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin and diet. Vital signs now are temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse 80/min and regular, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 150/92 mm Hg. The surgical incision appears clean and well approximated without abnormal erythema or swelling. The left lower extremity and foot appear pale. Palpation of the left lower extremity discloses a strong femoral pulse, a weak popliteal pulse, and a cool, pulseless foot. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?",

The patient now presents with increasing pain in the left foot, which is a new symptom. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which can lead to peripheral artery disease (PAD) and compromise blood flow to the extremities. The patient's symptoms of pain and cool, pulseless foot suggest acute limb ischemia (ALI). The patient's vital signs are stable, but the left lower extremity and foot appear pale, indicating poor perfusion. The strong femoral pulse and weak popliteal pulse suggest a distal obstruction. Given the patient's recent surgery and symptoms of ALI, it is essential to quickly diagnose the cause of the obstruction to restore blood flow to the affected limb. Bedside compartment pressure measurements (A) can help diagnose compartment syndrome, but it is not the most appropriate initial step in this scenario. Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity (B) can help evaluate blood flow, but it may not be able to visualize the popliteal artery. Intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy (C) is a treatment for acute limb ischemia, but it is typically reserved for cases where revascularization is not possible. Intraoperative angiography (D) is the most appropriate initial step to visualize the popliteal artery and determine the cause of the obstruction, which can then guide further management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

On the contrary, in a patient with no history suggestive of prior vascular disease, the etiology is most likely embolic, and simple thrombectomy is more likely to be successful.Absent bilateral femoral pulses in a patient with bilateral lower extremity ischemia is most likely due to saddle embolus to the aortic bifurcation. A palpable femoral pulse and absent popliteal and distal pulses may either be due to distal common femoral embolus (the pulse being palpable above the level of occlusion) or embolus to the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries.

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

The abdomen should be palpated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm, detected as an expansile pulse above the level of the umbilicus. It should also be examined for the presence of bruits. Because the aorta typically divides at the level of the umbilicus, an aortic aneurysm is most frequently palpable in the epigastrium. In thin individuals, a normal aortic pulsation is palpable, while in obese patients, even large aor-tic aneurysms may not be detectable. Suspicion of a clinically enlarged aorta should lead to the performance of an ultrasound scan for a more accurate definition of aortic diameter.The carotids should be auscultated for the presence of bruits, although there is a higher correlation with coronary artery disease than underlying carotid stenosis.

Although busy trauma centers continue to debate this issue, the surgeon who is obliged to treat the occasional injured patient may be better served by performing CTA in selected patients with soft signs. In patients with hard signs of vascular injury, on-table angi-ography may be useful to localize the arterial injury and thus, limit tissue dissection. For example, a patient with an absent popliteal pulse and femoral shaft fracture due to a bullet that entered the lateral hip and exited below the medial knee could have injured either the femoral or popliteal artery anywhere along its course (Fig. 7-31).GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENTOver the past 25 years there has been a remarkable change in management practices and operative approach for the injured patient.

This patient had no long-standing neurological deficit. A 65-year-old man was examined by a surgical intern because he had a history of buttock pain and impotence. On examination he had a reduced peripheral pulse on the left foot compared to the right. On direct questioning, the patient revealed that he experienced severe left-sided buttock pain after walking 100 yards. After a short period of rest, he could walk another 100 yards before the same symptoms recurred. He also noticed that over the past year he was unable to obtain an erection. He smoked heavily and was on no other drugs or treatment."

While the instances of acute leg ischemia caused by emboli have decreased due to more effective treatment of rheumatic fever and atrial fibrillation, the incidence of thrombotic acute leg ischemia has increased. Even with the extensive use of newer endovascular techniques including thrombolysis, most published series report a 10% to 30% 30-day amputation rate.115 The short-term mortal-ity of patients presenting with acute ischemia is 15% to 20%. The most common etiologies of ALI include embolism, native vessel thrombosis, reconstruction thrombosis, trauma, and com-plications of peripheral aneurysm. Most cases of lower extrem-ity ALI are the result of thrombosis of a prosthetic conduit. This stems from increased use of prosthetic conduits to address CLI.Presenting symptoms in ALI are pain and loss of sensory or motor function.
