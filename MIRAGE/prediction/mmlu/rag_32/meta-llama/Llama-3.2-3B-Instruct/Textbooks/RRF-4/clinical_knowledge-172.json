    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the functions of the frontal lobe as described in the provided documents. The frontal lobe is involved in various higher-order cognitive processes such as decision making, planning, problem-solving, motor control, and executive functions. It is also involved in personality and emotional behavior. The frontal lobe is subdivided into motor-premotor, dorsolateral prefrontal, medial prefrontal, and orbitofrontal components. The dorsolateral prefrontal, medial prefrontal, and orbitofrontal areas, along with the subcortical structures with which they are interconnected, collectively make up a large-scale network that coordinates complex aspects of human cognition and behavior. Given the options, let's evaluate each one: A. The sleep/wake cycle is more closely related to the reticular formation and other brainstem structures. B. The ability to draw shapes is more closely related to the occipital lobe and the parietal lobe. C. Understanding others' speech is more closely related to the temporal lobe, specifically Wernicke's area. D. Visual perception is more closely related to the occipital lobe. Considering the functions of the frontal lobe, option D is the least likely correct answer. However, the frontal lobe is involved in higher-order cognitive processes such as decision making and planning, which could be related to option A. But the sleep/wake cycle is not a direct function of the frontal lobe. Options B and C are not directly related to the frontal lobe. Between options A and D, option A is the most plausible answer because the frontal lobe is involved in executive functions such as decision making and planning, which could be related to the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle. However, the sleep/wake cycle is not a direct function of the frontal lobe. Therefore, the best answer is not explicitly stated in the provided documents, but based on the information given, we can eliminate options B, C, and D. The frontal lobe is involved in executive functions, which could be related to option A, but it is not a direct function of the frontal lobe. Given the options, the best answer is not explicitly stated in the provided documents, but based on the information given, option A is the most plausible answer. However, it is essential to note that the sleep/wake cycle is not a direct function of the frontal lobe. \", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

There is no doubt that the mind is greatly altered by disease of the prefrontal parts of the frontal lobes, but often it is difficult to say exactly how it is changed. Perhaps at present it is best to regard the frontal lobes as the part of the brain that quickly and effectively orients and drives the individual, with all the percepts and concepts formed from past life experiences, toward action that is projected into the future."

This folding greatly increases the surface area of cortex that can be fit into the limited and fixed volume within the skull. Indeed, most of the cortex cannot be seen from the brain surface because of this folding. The cerebral cortex can be divided into the left and right hemispheres and subdivided into a number of lobes (Fig. 10.1 Fig. 4.7 ), including the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes.

This was aptly summarized by Luria (1966 and 1973) as \u201cgoal-directed behavior.\u201d Of necessity in such a scheme, there must also be inhibitory mechanisms that control or modulate behavior. Thus, aside from the overt abnormalities of motor, speech, and voluntary movement, lesions of the frontal lobes give rise to a loss of drive, impairment of consecutive planning, an inability to maintain serial relationships of events, and to shift easily from one mental activity to another. These are combined with sucking, grasping, and groping reflexes and other obligate behaviors. In the emotional sphere, frontal lobe lesions may cause anhedonia (lack of pleasure), apathy, loss of self-control, disinhibited social behavior, and euphoria, as described further on."

            "content": "The frontal lobes lie anterior to the central or rolandic sulcus and superior to the sylvian fissure (Fig. 21-1). They are larger in humans (30 percent of the cerebrum) than in any other primate (9 percent in the macaque). Several systems of neurons are located here, and they subserve different functions. Brodmann areas 4, 6, 8, and 44 relate specifically to motor activities. The primary motor cortex, that is, area 4, is directly connected with somatosensory neurons of the anterior part of the postcentral gyrus as well as with other parietal areas, thalamic and red nuclei, and the reticular formation of the brainstem. The supplementary motor cortex, a portion of area 6, shares most of these connections. As pointed out in earlier chapters, all motor activity requires sensory guidance, and this comes from the somesthetic, visual, and auditory cortices and from the cerebellum via the ventral tier of thalamic nuclei."

            "content": "From these remarks, it follows that subdivision of the cerebrum into frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes is somewhat of an abstraction in terms of landmarks and cerebral function. Some of these delineations were made long before our first glimmer of knowledge about the function of the cerebrum. Even when neurohistologists began parceling the neocortex, they found that their areas did not fall neatly within zones bounded by sulci and fissures. Therefore, when the terms frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital are used, it is largely to provide the clinician with familiar and manageable anatomic landmarks for localization (Fig. 21-1)."
