The inner membrane is further divided into the intermembrane space and the cristae space, which is enclosed by the cristae. The thylakoid membrane is a separate compartment that is surrounded by the thylakoid space. Therefore, the correct sequence should be: the innermost membrane is the thylakoid membrane, followed by the inner membrane, and then the outer membrane.

Like the precursors of some mitochondrial proteins, the precursors of these proteins are translocated from the cytosol to their final destination in two steps. First, they pass across the double membrane into the matrix space (called the stroma in chloroplasts), and then they either integrate into the thylakoid membrane or translocate into the thylakoid space (Figure 12\u201326A). The precursors of these proteins have a hydrophobic thylakoid signal sequence following the N-terminal chloroplast signal sequence.

In eukaryotic cells, most of the ATP that powers life processes is produced by specialized, membrane-enclosed, energy-converting organelles. These are of two types. Mitochondria, which occur in virtually all cells of animals, plants, and fungi, burn food molecules to produce ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Chloroplasts, which occur only in plants and green algae, harness solar energy to produce ATP by photosynthesis. In electron micrographs, the most striking features of both mitochondria and chloroplasts are their extensive internal membrane systems.

            "content": "The mechanisms by which chloroplasts and bacteria divide are also similar. Both utilize FtsZ proteins, which are self-assembling GTPases related to tubulins (see Chapter 16). Bacterial FtsZ is a soluble protein that assembles into a dynamic ring of membrane-attached protofilaments beneath the plasma membrane in the middle of the dividing cell. The FtsZ ring acts as a scaffold for recruitment of other cell-division proteins and generates a contractile force that results in membrane constriction and eventually in cell division. Presumably, chloroplasts divide in very much the same way. Although both employ membrane-interacting GTPases, the mechanisms by which mitochondria and chloroplasts divide are fundamentally different. The machinery for chloroplast division acts from the inside, as in bacteria, while the dynamin-like GTPases divide mitochondria from the outside (see Figure 14\u201363).

Both processes occur post-translationally, use separate translocation complexes in each membrane, require energy, and use amphiphilic N-terminal signal sequences that are removed after use. With the exception of some of the chaperone molecules, however, the protein components that form the translocation complexes differ. Moreover, whereas mitochondria harness the electrochemical H+ gradient across their inner membrane to drive transport, chloroplasts, which have an electrochemical H+ gradient across their thylakoid membrane but not their inner membrane, use GTP and ATP hydrolysis to power import across their double membrane. The functional similarities may thus result from convergent evolution, reflecting the common requirements for translocation across a double membrane."

In Chapter 14, we discuss how such photosynthetic complexes function to capture light energy and use it to pump H+ across the membrane. Many of the membrane protein complexes involved in photosynthesis, proton pumping, and electron transport are even larger than the photosynthetic reaction center. The enormous photosystem II complex from cyanobacteria, for example, contains 19 protein subunits and well over 60 transmembrane helices (see Figure 14\u201349).

In vitro studies suggest that the ATP synthase needs a proton gradient of about 2 pH units to produce ATP at the rate required by the cell, irrespective of the membrane potential. The H+ gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane is only 0.5 to 0.6 pH units. The cristae thus seem to work as proton traps that enable the ATP synthase to make efficient use of the protons pumped out of the mitochondrial matrix.

            "content": "In another transport route to the inner membrane or intermembrane space, the TIM23 complex initially translocates the entire protein into the matrix space (Figure 12\u201325B). A matrix signal peptidase then removes the N-terminal signal sequence, exposing a hydrophobic sequence at the new N-terminus. This signal sequence guides the protein to the OXA complex, which inserts the protein into the inner membrane. As mentioned earlier, the OXA complex is primarily used to insert proteins that are encoded and translated in the mitochondrion into the inner membrane, and only a few imported proteins use this pathway. Translocators that are closely related to the OXA complex are found in the plasma membrane of bacteria and in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts, where they insert membrane proteins by a similar mechanism."

            "content": "In the electron microscope, the mitochondrial ATP synthase complexes can be seen to project like lollipops on the matrix side of cristae membranes. Recent studies by cryoelectron microscopy and tomography have shown that this large complex is not distributed randomly in the membrane, but forms long rows of dimers along the cristae ridges (Figure 14\u201332). The dimer rows induce or stabilize these regions of high membrane curvature, which are otherwise energetically unfavorable. Indeed, the formation of ATP synthase dimers and their assembly into rows are required for cristae formation and have far-reaching consequences for cellular fitness. By contrast with bacterial or chloroplast ATP synthases, which do not form dimers, the mitochondrial complex contains additional subunits, located mostly near the membrane end of the stator stalk. Several of these subunits are found to be dimer-specific. If these subunits are mutated in yeast, the ATP synthase in the membrane remains monomeric, the"
