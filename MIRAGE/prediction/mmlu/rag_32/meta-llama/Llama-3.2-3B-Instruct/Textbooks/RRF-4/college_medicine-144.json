The great majority are serine/threonine kinases, which phosphorylate the hydroxyl groups of serines and threonines in their targets. Others are tyrosine kinases, which phosphorylate proteins on tyrosines. The two types of protein kinase are closely related members of a large family, differing primarily in the structure of their protein substrate binding sites. Many intracellular signaling proteins controlled by phosphorylation are themselves protein kinases, and these are often organized into kinase cascades. In such a cascade, one protein kinase, activated by phosphorylation, phosphorylates the next protein kinase in the sequence, and so on, relaying the signal onward and, in some cases, amplifying it or spreading it to other signaling pathways."

As resistance mechanisms become better defined, rational strategies to overcome resistance will emerge.

The various family members contain different amino acid sequences on either end of the kinase sequence (for example, see Figure 3\u201310), and often have short amino acid sequences inserted into loops within it. Some of these additional amino acid sequences enable each kinase to recognize the specific set of proteins it phosphorylates, or to bind to structures that localize it in specific regions of the cell. Other parts of the protein regulate the activity of each kinase, so it can be turned on and off in response to different specific signals, as described below."

            "content": "Almost all second messenger signaling involves reversible phosphorylation, which performs two principal functions in signaling: amplification and flexible regulation. In amplification, rather like GTP bound to a G protein, the attachment of a phosphoryl group to a serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue powerfully amplifies the initial regulatory signal by recording a molecular memory that the pathway has been activated; dephosphorylation erases the memory, taking a longer time to do so than is required for dissociation of an allosteric ligand. In flexible regulation, differing substrate specificities of the multiple protein kinases regulated by second messengers provide branch points in signaling pathways that may be independently regulated. In this way, cAMP, Ca2+, or other second messengers can use the presence or absence of particular kinases or kinase substrates to produce quite different effects in different cell types. Inhibitors of protein kinases have great potential as"

Tyrosine kinase is closely associated with focal adhesion molecules, so the area where focal adhesions are formed is labeled red. Note the relationship of focal adhesions and actin filaments at the periphery of the cell. 3,000. (Courtesy of Dr. Keith Burridge.)"
