    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the question: 1. The question states that a technician is trying to determine whether CMV DNA is present in the blood of a bone marrow transplant recipient. 2. The technician has purified DNA from the leukocytes of the patient and reacted it in a mixture containing oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides. 3. The reaction involves repetitive cycles of heating and cooling, and the reaction product is detected by gel electrophoresis. 4. This process is a common method for amplifying specific DNA sequences. Considering these points, we can rule out the following options: * Northern blotting (A) is a method for detecting specific RNA sequences, not DNA. * Reverse transcription (C) is a process that converts RNA into DNA, which is not relevant to this scenario. * Southern blotting (D) is a method for detecting specific DNA sequences, but it typically involves digestion of DNA with restriction enzymes and separation of the fragments by gel electrophoresis, which is not described in the scenario. This leaves us with the following option: * Polymerase chain reaction (B) The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a laboratory technique used to amplify specific DNA sequences. The description of the reaction mixture and the use of oligonucleotides, thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides matches the process of PCR. Therefore, the technician most likely used polymerase chain reaction to detect CMV DNA in the patient's blood. Here is the output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The technician used PCR to detect CMV DNA in the patient's blood.

Isolation of CMV or detection of its antigens or DNA in appropriate clinical specimens is the preferred approach. The most common method of detection is quantitative nucleic acid testing (QNAT) for CMV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, for which blood or other specimens can be used; some centers use a CMV antigenemia test, an immunofluorescence assay that detects CMV antigens (pp65) in peripheral-blood leukocytes. Such assays may yield a positive result several days earlier than culture methods. QNAT may predict the risk for disease progression, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. CMV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid is useful in the diagnosis of CMV encephalitis or polyradiculopathy. Considerable variation exists among assays and laboratories; a recently introduced international testing standard should help reduce variation in PCR test results."

In late adolescence and young adulthood, CMV is often transmitted sexually, and asymptomatic carriage in semen or cervical secretions is common. Antibody to CMV is present at detectable levels in a high proportion of sexually active men and women, who may harbor several strains simultaneously. Transfusion of blood products containing viable leukocytes may transmit CMV, with a frequency of 0.14\u201310% per unit transfused. Transfusion of leukocyte-reduced or CMV-seronegative blood significantly decreases the risk of CMV transmission."

Urine output should be monitored and adequate hydration maintained to prevent precipitation of hemo-globin within the tubules. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reac-tions do not usually require specific intervention.Transmission of Disease. Malaria, Chagas\u2019 disease, brucel-losis, and, very rarely, syphilis are among the diseases that have been transmitted by transfusion. Malaria can be transmitted by all blood components. The species most commonly implicated is Plasmodium malariae. The incubation period ranges from 8 to 100 days; the initial manifestations are shaking chills and spiking fever. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection resembling infectious mononucleosis also has occurred.Transmission of hepatitis C and"

During this period, this infection may represent primary disease (in the case of a seronegative recipient of a kidney from a seropositive donor) or may represent reactivation disease or superinfection. Patients may have atypical lymphocytosis. Unlike immunocompetent patients, however, they rarely have lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly. Therefore, clinical suspicion and laboratory confirmation are necessary for diagnosis. The clinical syndrome may be accompanied by bone marrow suppression (particularly leukopenia). CMV also causes glomerulopathy and is associated with an increased incidence of other opportunistic infections. Because of the frequency and severity of disease, a considerable effort has been made to prevent and treat CMV infection in renal transplant recipients. An immune globulin preparation enriched with antibodies to CMV was used by many centers in the past in an effort to protect the group at"

Following intravenous infusion, CSF concentrations range from 15 to 100% of coincident plasma levels. The usual dose for serious CMV-related neurologic illness is 60 mg/kg every 8 h administered by constant infusion over 1 h. Induction therapy for 14\u201321 days is followed by maintenance therapy (60\u2013120 mg/kg per day). Induction therapy may need to be extended in patients who fail to show a decline in CSF pleocytosis and a reduction in CSF CMV DNA copy number on quantitative PCR tests (where available). Approximately one-third of patients develop renal impairment during treatment, which is reversible following discontinuation of therapy in most, but not all, cases. This is often associated with elevations in serum creatinine and proteinuria and is less frequent in patients who are adequately hydrated. Many patients experience fatigue and nausea.
