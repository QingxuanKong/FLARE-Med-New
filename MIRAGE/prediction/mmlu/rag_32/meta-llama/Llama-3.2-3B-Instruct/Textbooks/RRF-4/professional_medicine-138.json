    "question": "A previously healthy 27-year-old man comes to the physician 4 weeks after noticing three nontender lesions on his penis. He says they have not changed in size. He is sexually active with multiple male and female partners and uses condoms inconsistently. He takes no medications. He drinks two to five beers on social occasions. He occasionally smokes marijuana. His temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F). There is no lymphadenopathy. Examination shows three sessile, flesh-colored lesions on the shaft of the penis that are 10 mm in diameter. On application of a dilute solution of acetic acid, the lesions turn white. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with three nontender lesions on his penis, which have not changed in size over 4 weeks. The lesions are described as sessile, flesh-colored, and 10 mm in diameter, and turn white on application of a dilute solution of acetic acid. This presentation is highly suggestive of condyloma acuminata, also known as genital warts. The patient's sexual history of multiple male and female partners and inconsistent condom use increases his risk for sexually transmitted infections, including human papillomavirus (HPV), which is the primary cause of condyloma acuminata. The appropriate next step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis and consider treatment options. The lesions can be confirmed with a biopsy, but given the clinical presentation, it is likely that the patient has condyloma acuminata. Treatment options for condyloma acuminata include cryotherapy, which is a common and effective treatment for genital warts. Oral acyclovir therapy is typically used for herpes simplex virus infections, not HPV. Oral doxycycline therapy is used for chlamydia and gonorrhea infections, not HPV. Intramuscular penicillin therapy is used for syphilis, not HPV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Multiple primary lesions are seen in a minority of patients. In heterosexual men the chancre is usually located on the penis (Fig. 206-2; see also Fig. 25e-17), whereas in MSM it may be found in the anal canal or rectum, in the mouth, or on the external genitalia. Oral sex has been identified as the source of infection in some MSM. In women, common primary sites are the cervix and labia. Consequently, primary syphilis goes unrecognized in women and homosexual men more often than in heterosexual men. FIGuRE 206-2 Primary syphilis with a firm, nontender chancre."

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Persistence of symptoms after a course of therapy for epididymitis suggests the possibility of testicular tumor or of a chronic granulomatous disease, such as tuberculosis. In sexually active men under age 35, acute epididymitis is caused most frequently by C. trachomatis and less commonly by N. gonorrhoeae and is usually associated with overt or subclinical urethritis. Acute epididymitis occurring in older men or following urinary tract instrumentation is usually caused by urinary pathogens. Similarly, epididymitis in men who have practiced insertive rectal intercourse is often caused by Enterobacteriaceae. These older men usually have no urethritis but do have bacteriuria."

Painless, nontender, indurated ulcers with firm, nontender inguinal adenopathy suggest primary syphilis. If results of dark-field examination and a rapid serologic test for syphilis are initially negative, presumptive therapy should be provided on the basis of the individual\u2019s risk. For example, with increasing rates of syphilis among MSM in the United States, most experts would not withhold therapy for this infection pending watchful waiting and/or subsequent detection of seroconversion.

He saw his PCP for evaluation of low back pain. X-rays of the spine showed some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine plus several wedge deformities in the thoracic spine. The patient is a long-time smoker (up to two packs per day) and has two to four glasses of wine with dinner, more on the weekends. He has chronic bronchitis, presumably from smoking, and has been treated on numerous occasions with oral prednisone for exacerba-tions of bronchitis. He is currently on 10 mg/d prednisone. Examination shows kyphosis of the thoracic spine, with some tenderness to fist percussion over the thoracic spine. The dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measure-ment of the lumbar spine is \u201cwithin the normal limits,\u201d but the radiologist noted that the reading may be misleading because of degenerative changes. The hip measurement shows a T score (number of standard"

A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."

Although digital examination of the prostate gland seldom contributes to the evaluation of sexually active young men with urethritis, men with dysuria who lack evidence of urethritis as well as sexually inactive men with urethritis should undergo prostate palpation, urinalysis, and urine culture to exclude bacterial prostatitis and cystitis. 3."
