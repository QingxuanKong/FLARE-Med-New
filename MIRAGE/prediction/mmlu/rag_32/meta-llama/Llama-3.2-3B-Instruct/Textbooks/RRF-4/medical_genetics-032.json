According to Document [0], familial hypercholesterolemia is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the LDL receptor. The LDL receptor is involved in the transport and metabolism of cholesterol. In Document [1], it is mentioned that FDB (familial defective apoB-100) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding apoB-100, specifically in the LDL receptor-binding domain of apoB-100. In Document [2], it is mentioned that mutations in the LDL receptor protein impair the intracellular transport and catabolism of LDL, resulting in accumulation of LDL cholesterol in the plasma. In Document [3], it is mentioned that the LDL receptor gene has more than 900 different mutations that can cause familial hypercholesterolemia, which can be divided into five categories. Class II mutations are the most prevalent type, and they are associated with impaired transport of the receptor protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. In Document [7], it is mentioned that FDB (familial defective apoB-100) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding apoB-100, specifically in the LDL receptor-binding domain of apoB-100. In Document [8], it is mentioned that familial hypercholesterolemia is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the LDL receptor.

As a consequence of receptor abnormalities there is a loss of feedback control that normally holds cholesterol synthesis in check. The resulting elevated levels of cholesterol induce premature atherosclerosis and greatly increase the risk of myocardial infarction. Familial hypercholesterolemia is among the most common of mendelian disorders; the frequency of the heterozygous condition is 1 in 500 in the general population. Approximately 7% of the body\u2019s cholesterol circulates in the plasma, predominantly in the form of LDL. As might be expected, the amount of plasma cholesterol is influenced by its synthesis and catabolism, and the liver plays a crucial role in both these processes, as described later.

The mutation results in a reduction in the affinity of LDL binding to the LDL receptor, so LDL is removed from the circulation at a reduced rate. FDB is less common than FH but is more prevalent in individuals of central European descent; the Lancaster County (United States) Amish are a founder population in which the prevalence of FDB is as high as 1 in 10 individuals.

In addition, the absence of LDL receptors on liver cells impairs the transport of IDL into the liver, so a greater proportion of plasma IDL is converted into LDL. Thus, patients with familial hypercholesterolemia develop excessive levels of serum cholesterol as a result of the combined effects of reduced catabolism and excessive biosynthesis ( Fig. 7.1 ). This leads to a marked increase of cholesterol uptake by the monocyte-macrophages and vascular walls through the scavenger receptor. This accounts for the appearance of skin xanthomas and premature atherosclerosis."

Families with activating mutations of the gene PCSK9, which codes for the enzyme, have many features similar to classic familial hypercholesterolemia.

Genetic defects in lipoprotein uptake and metabolism that cause hyperlipoproteinemia are associated with accelerated atherosclerosis. Thus, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, caused by defective LDL receptors and inadequate hepatic LDL uptake, can lead to myocardial infarction by 20 years of age. Other genetic or acquired disorders (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism) that cause hypercholesterolemia lead to premature atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic analyses (e.g., the Framingham study) demonstrate a significant correlation between the levels of total plasma cholesterol or LDL and the severity of atherosclerosis. Lowering serum cholesterol by diet or drugs slows the rate of progression of atherosclerosis, causes regression of some plaques, and reduces the risk for cardiovascular events."

PCSK9 is a secreted protein that binds to the LDL receptor, targeting it for degradation. Normally, after LDL binds to the LDL receptor, it is internalized along with the receptor, and in the low pH of the endosome, the LDL receptor dissociates from the LDL and recycles to the cell surface. When PCSK9 binds the receptor, the complex is internalized and the receptor is directed to the lysosome, rather than to the cell surface.

ApoC-II deficiency is also recessive in inheritance pattern and is even less common than LPL deficiency. Multiple different mutations in the LPL and APOC2 genes cause these diseases. Obligate LPL heterozygotes often have mild-to-moderate elevations in plasma TG levels, whereas individuals heterozygous for mutation in apoC-II do not have hypertriglyceridemia."

This gene encodes an inward rectifier potassium channel, and the mutations affected amino acids in or close to the chan-nel\u2019s selectivity filter. Somatic gain of function mutations are found in up to 40% of aldosterone-producing adenomas (APA). Familial hyperaldosteronism type II refers to families in which two first-degree relatives have been diagnosed with primary hyperaldosteronism (adenoma or hyperplasia) and in whom types I and III have been excluded. Other genes mutated in (APA) include CACNA1D (encodes a voltage-gated L-type calcium channel), ATP1A1 (encodes part of the Na+-K+-ATPase), ATP2B3 (encodes the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase), CACNA1H (encodes the \u03b11 subunit of the T-type voltage calcium channel), and CTNNB1 (\u03b2-catenin).97Symptoms and Signs Patients typically present with hyperten-sion, which is long-standing, moderate to"

The molecular etiology of this condition remains poorly understood, and no single gene has been identified in which mutations cause this disorder. It is likely that defects in a combination of genes can cause the condition, suggesting that a more appropriate term for the disorder might be polygenic combined hyperlipidemia."

            "content": "familial dySBetalipoproteinemia (fdBl) FDBL (also known as type III hyperlipoproteinemia) is usually a recessive disorder characterized by a mixed hyperlipidemia (elevated cholesterol and TGs) due to the accumulation of remnant lipoprotein particles (chylomicron remnants and VLDL remnants, or IDL). ApoE is present in multiple copies on chylomicron remnants and IDL, and mediates their removal via hepatic lipoprotein receptors (Fig. 421-2). FDBL is due to genetic variants of apoE, most commonly apoE2, that result in an apoE protein with reduced ability to bind lipoprotein receptors. The APOE gene is polymorphic in sequence, resulting in the expression of three common isoforms: apoE3, which is the most common; and apoE2 and apoE4, which both differ from apoE3 by a single amino acid. Although associated with slightly higher LDL-C levels and increased CHD risk, the apoE4 allele is not associated with FDBL. Individuals who carry one or two apoE4 alleles have an increased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s"
