She had a normal Pap smear 3 months ago and saw her ophthalmologist 6 months ago. Her 67-year-old grandmother has breast cancer. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 20 kg/m2 . Her hemoglobin A1c is 6.2%, and fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 118 mg/dL.

She also has a normal Pap smear and had a mammogram 6 months ago. Her grandmother has breast cancer, but this is not a direct concern for her.\\n\\nGiven her age and medical history, the most appropriate health maintenance recommendation would be to consider human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. HPV testing is recommended for women between the ages of 21 and 29 years, and it is also recommended for women who have a weakened immune system or who have had a previous Pap smear showing high-grade dysplasia or cancer.\\n\\nDietary modification for weight loss is not necessary given her normal weight and BMI. Mammography is not recommended for women under the age of 40, so this is not a suitable option. Influenza virus vaccine is recommended for all adults 50 years and older, but not for someone under 50.\\n\\nTherefore, the most appropriate health maintenance recommendation for this patient is HPV testing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Case 3: Hyperglycemia and Hyperketonemia Patient Presentation: MW, a 40-year-old woman, was brought to the hospital in a disoriented, confused state by her husband. Focused History: As noted on her medical alert bracelet, MW has had type 1 diabetes (T1D) for the last 24 years. Her husband reports that this is her first medical emergency in 2 years. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): MW displayed signs of dehydration (such as dry mucous membranes and skin, poor skin turgor, and low blood pressure) and acidosis (such as deep, rapid breathing [Kussmaul respiration]). Her breath had a faintly fruity odor. Her temperature was normal."

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."
