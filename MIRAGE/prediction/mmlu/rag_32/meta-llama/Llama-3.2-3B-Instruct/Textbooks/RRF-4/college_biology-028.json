These selectively neutral mutations can also spread and become fixed in a population, and they make a large contribution to evolutionary change in genomes. For example, as we saw earlier, they account for most of the DNA sequence differences between apes and humans. The spread of neutral mutations is not as rapid as the spread of the rare strongly advantageous mutations. It depends on a random variation in the number of mutation-bearing progeny produced by each mutation-bearing individual, causing changes in the relative frequency of the mutant allele in the population. Through a sort of \u201crandom walk\u201d process, the mutant allele may eventually become extinct, or it may become commonplace. This can be modeled mathematically for an idealized interbreeding population, on the assumption of constant population size and random mating, as well as selective neutrality for the mutations.

If the mutation has a significantly deleterious effect, it will simply be eliminated by purifying selection and will not become fixed. (In the most extreme case, the individual carrying the mutation will die without producing progeny.) Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population. Because humans reproduce sexually and genetic recombination occurs each time a gamete is formed (discussed in Chapter 5), the genome of each individual who has inherited the mutation will be a unique recombinational mosaic of segments inherited from a large number of ancestors. The selected mutation along with a modest amount of neighboring sequence\u2014ultimately inherited from the individual in which the mutation occurred\u2014will simply be one piece of this huge mosaic."

This is because there are 2N copies of the gene in the diploid population, and each of them has an equal chance of becoming the predominant version in the long run. For those mutations that do become fixed, the mathematics shows that the average time to fixation is approximately 4N generations. Detailed analyses of data on human genetic variation have suggested an ancestral population size of approximately 10,000 at the time when the current pattern of genetic variation was largely established. With a population that has reached this size, the probability that a new, selectively neutral mutation would become fixed is small (1/20,000), while the average time to fixation would be on the order of 800,000 years (assuming a 20-year generation time).

Commonly, the transferred cells are \u2018marked\u2019 with an allelic variant of an abundant cell-surface receptor, such as CD45 (Fig. A.41). When the donor lymphocytes express one allelic variant of CD45 and the recipient cells express a different variant, the transferred cells can easily be distinguished from the host cells by staining with an antibody that binds to one variant of CD45, but not the other. When two strains of mice are genetically identical with the exception of a single gene, they are said to be congenic. In the example above, the donor strain and the recipient strain are referred to as \u2018CD45 congenics\u2019; it should be noted, however, that in the case where one strain is a T-cell receptor or B-cell receptor transgenic line, this terminology is not completely accurate, as the presence of the transgenic DNA as a genetic difference is conveniently ignored. Such adoptive transfer studies are a cornerstone in the study of the intact immune system. They"
