To use a peak flow meter, a child should be standing with the indicator placed at the bottom of the scale. The child must inhale deeply, place the device in the mouth, seal the lips around the mouthpiece, and blow out forcefully and rapidly. The indicator moves up the numeric scale. The PEFR is the highest number achieved. The test is repeated three times to obtain the best possible effort. Peak flow meters are available as low range (<300 L/sec) and high range (<700 L/sec). It is important to provide the appropriate range meter so that accurate measurements can be obtained and children do not become discouraged because their exhalations barely move the indicator."

However, the flow rates at lower lung volumes converge; this indicates that with modest effort, maximal expiratory flow is achieved. No amount of effort will increase the flow rates as lung volume decreases. For this reason, expiratory flow rates at lower lung volumes are said to be effort independent and flow limited because maximal flow is achieved with modest effort, and no amount of additional effort can increase the flow rate beyond this limit. In contrast, events early in the expiratory maneuver are said to be effort dependent; that is, increasing effort generates increasing flow rates.

This results in a reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio, and peak expiratory flow (PEF), as well as an increase in airway resistance. Early closure of peripheral airway results in lung hyperinflation (air trapping) and increased residual volume, particularly during acute exacerbations and in severe persistent asthma. In more severe asthma, reduced ventilation and increased pulmonary blood flow result in mismatching of ventilation and perfusion and in bronchial hyperemia. Ventilatory failure is very uncommon, even in patients with severe asthma, and arterial PCO2 tends to be low due to increased ventilation."

            "content": "Respiratory system mechanics can be measured in patients during mechanical ventilation (Chap. 323). When volume-controlled modes of mechanical ventilation are used, accompanying airway pressures can easily be measured as long as the patient is passive. The peak airway pressure is determined by two variables: airway resistance and respiratory system compliance. At the end of inspiration, inspiratory flow can be stopped transiently. This end-inspiratory pause (plateau pressure) is a static measurement, affected only by respiratory system compliance and not by airway resistance. Therefore, during volume-controlled ventilation, the difference between the peak (airway resistance + respiratory system compliance) and plateau (respiratory system compliance only) airway pressures provides a quantitative assessment of airway resistance. Accordingly, during volume-controlled ventilation, patients with increases in airway resistance typically have increased peak airway pressures as well as"

The peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) can be obtained with a simple handheld deviceand may be useful for home monitoring of older childrenwith asthma. However, it is highly dependent on patienteffort, and values must be interpreted with caution. Inhalation challenge tests using methacholine, histamine, or cold, dry air are used to assess airway hyperreactivity, but require sophisticated equipment and special expertise and should be performed only in a pulmonary function laboratory with experienced technicians."

            "content": "The pressure-flow characteristics of laminar flow were first described by the French physician Poiseuille and apply to both liquids and air. In straight circular tubes the flow rate (V\u0307 ) is defined by the following equation: Equation 22.1 where P is the driving pressure, r is the radius of the tube, \u03b7 is the viscosity of the fluid, and l is the length of the tube. It can be seen that driving pressure (P) is proportional to the flow rate (V\u0307 ); thus the greater the pressure, the greater the flow. The flow resistance (R) across a set of tubes is defined as the change in driving pressure (\u0394P) divided by the flow rate, or: Equation 22.2"

Table 25-2 shows the normal values for these components of the 24-hour record at the whole-number pH threshold derived from 50 normal asymptom-atic subjects. The upper limits of normal were established at the 95th percentile. Most centers use pH 4 as the threshold.Based on these studies and extensive clinical experience, 48-hour esophageal pH monitoring is considered to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of GERD.The Bravo pH Capsule (Medtronics, Minneapolis, MN) measures pH levels in the esophagus and transmits continuous Brunicardi_Ch25_p1009-p1098.indd 102901/03/19 6:03 PM 1030SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONSPART II210:0012:0014:0016:0018:0047pH218:0020:0022:0000:0002:0047202:0004:0006:0008:0010:0047pH probe5 cmabove5"
