    "question": "A 50-year-old woman comes to the office for the first time because of recurrent abdominal pain. Review of her extensive medical chart, which she has brought with her, discloses that she has a long history of varying physical symptoms. Definitive causes for these symptoms have not been found despite extensive diagnostic studies, consultations with many physicians, and several surgical explorations. She gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her present and past symptoms, and she makes conflicting statements about her history. She has been hospitalized at least 23 times since age 18 years. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

IBS is one of the most common causes of abdominal pain and must always be kept in mind (Chap. 352). The location of the pain can assist in narrowing the differential diagnosis (Table 20-3); however, the chronological sequence of events in the patient\u2019s history is often more important than the pain\u2019s location. If the examiner is sufficiently open-minded and unhurried, asks the proper questions, and listens, the patient will usually provide the diagnosis. Careful attention should be paid to the extraabdominal regions. Narcotics or analgesics should not be withheld until a definitive diagnosis or a definitive plan has been formulated; obfuscation of the diagnosis by adequate analgesia is unlikely."

Few clinical situations require greater judgment, because the most catastrophic of events may be forecast by the subtlest of symptoms and signs. In every instance, the clinician must distinguish those conditions 20 that require urgent intervention from those that do not and can best be managed nonoperatively. A meticulously executed, detailed history and physical examination are critically important for focusing the differential diagnosis, where necessary, and allowing the diagnostic evaluation to proceed expeditiously (Table 20-1). The etiologic classification in Table 20-2, although not complete, provides a useful framework for evaluating patients with abdominal pain."

The senior physician realized that a potential cause of the abdominal pain was a pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). The patient was rushed for an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed no fetus or sac in the uterus. She was also noted to have a positive pregnancy test. The patient underwent surgery and was found to have a ruptured fallopian tube caused by an ectopic pregnancy. Whenever a patient has apparent pelvic pain, it is important to consider the gender-related anatomical differences. Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age."

Hematuria, pyuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness point to a GU etiology. If associated with meals, consider mesenteric ischemia, PUD, biliary disease, pancreatitis, or bowel pathology. A family history of abdominal pain may indicate familial Mediterranean fever or acute intermittent porphyria."

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

The American Gastroenterological Association has delineated factors to be considered when determining the aggressiveness of the diagnostic evaluation. These include the duration of symptoms, the change in symptoms over time, the age and sex of the patient, the referral status of the patient, prior diagnostic studies, a family history of colorectal malignancy, and the degree of psychosocial dysfunction. Thus, a younger individual with mild symptoms requires a minimal diagnostic evaluation, while an older person or an individual with rapidly progressive symptoms should undergo a more thorough exclusion of organic disease. Most patients should have a complete blood count and sigmoidoscopic examination; in addition, stool specimens should be examined for ova and parasites in those who have diarrhea. In patients with persistent diarrhea not"

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

The technique used in taking the history of the present illness varies with the patient, the patient\u2019s problem, and the physician. Allow the patient to talk about her chief symptom. Although this symptom may or may not represent the real problem (depending on subsequent evaluation), it is usually uppermost in the patient\u2019s mind and most often constitutes the basis for the visit to the physician. During the phase of the interview, establish the temporal relation of the chief symptom to the total duration of the illness. Questions such as, \u201cThen up to the time of this symptom, you felt perfectly well?\u201d may elicit other symptoms that may antedate the chief one by days, months, or years. In this manner, the patient may recall the date of the first appearance of illness. Encourage the patient to talk freely and spontaneously about her illness from the established date of onset. Do not interrupt the patient\u2019s account,"
