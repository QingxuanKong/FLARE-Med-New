The patient presents with fever, chills, malaise, and pain of the vulva, which suggests a systemic infection. The key findings are a vulvar pustule that has ulcerated and formed multiple satellite lesions, and palpable inguinal and femoral lymphadenopathy. Chlamydia trachomatis (A) is a common cause of genital ulcers, but it is not typically associated with systemic symptoms like fever and chills. Chlamydia trachomatis infections usually present with a single, painless ulcer. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (C) can cause genital ulcers, but it is also typically associated with other symptoms like dysuria and purulent discharge. Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections usually present with a single, painless ulcer. Streptococcus pyogenes (D) can cause skin infections, including pharyngitis and impetigo, but it is not typically associated with genital ulcers or systemic symptoms like fever and chills. Haemophilus ducreyi (B) is the causative agent of chancroid, a sexually transmitted infection characterized by painful genital ulcers and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. The presence of fever, chills, and malaise, along with a painful vulvar ulcer and satellite lesions, is consistent with chancroid. The systemic symptoms and the presence of tender inguinal lymphadenopathy further support this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely causal organism is Haemophilus ducreyi.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",

Over the course of several days, the surface of the primary lesion erodes to produce an irregular ulcer, which is more likely to be painful in males than in females. The regional lymph nodes, particularly in the inguinal region, become enlarged and tender in about 50% of cases within 1 to 2 weeks of the primary inoculation. In untreated cases, the inflamed and enlarged nodes (buboes) may erode the overlying skin to produce chronic, draining ulcers.

A careful sexual history is essential, as is a careful examination of the vulvar area and vagina. Vulvodynia is the term used to describe unexplained vulvar pain, sexual dysfunction, and the resultant psychological disability (240,241). The term vulvar vestibulitis was previously used to describe a situation in which there is pain during intercourse or when attempting to insert an object into the vagina; pain on pressure to the vestibule on examination and vestibular erythema (known as Friedrich\u2019s triad); this entity is now described as localized provoked vulvodynia in the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD) (240\u2013243) (see Chapter 16). A number of recent studies failed to demonstrate a consistent relationship with any genital infectious organism, including C."

            "content": "In postmenarchal individuals, vulvar symptoms are most often related to a primary vaginitis and a secondary vulvitis. The mere presence of vaginal discharge can lead to vulvar irritative symptoms, or candidal vulvitis may be present (Fig. 14.17). The causes of vaginitis and cervicitis are covered in Chapter 18. Adult women describe vulvar symptoms using a variety of terms (itching, pain, discharge, discomfort, burning, external dysuria, soreness, pain with intercourse or sexual activity). Burning with urination from noninfectious causes may be difficult to distinguish from a urinary tract infection, although some women can distinguish pain when the urine hits the vulvar area (an external dysuria) from burning pain (often suprapubic in location) during urination. Itching is a very common vulvar symptom. A variety of vulvar conditions and lesions can present with pruritus. As in adolescents, vulvovaginal symptoms may be caused by STDs, nonsexually transmitted vaginitis, or UTIs. The"

They are spread by direct skin contact, and present on the vulva, as well as abdomen, trunk, arms, and thighs. Lesions typically clear in several months, but they can be treated with cryotherapy, curettage, or cantharidin, a topical blistering agent.Genital Ulcers. The frequency of the infectious etiologies of genital ulcers varies by geographic location. The most common causes of sexually transmitted genital ulcers in young adults in the United States are, in descending order of prevalence, herpes simplex virus (HSV), syphilis, and chancroid.15 Other infec-tious causes of genital ulcers include lymphogranuloma vene-reum and granuloma inguinale. Noninfectious etiologies include Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, neoplasms, and trauma. Table 41-3 outlines a rational approach to their evaluation and diagnosis.3Brunicardi_Ch41_p1783-p1826.indd 179118/02/19 4:34 PM"

VIN III: Carcinoma in situ. Precancerous lesions: Reduce irritative or other predisposing causes. Topical corticosteroids (e.g., betamethasone, clobetasol) and crotamiton are particularly effective for pruritus. High-grade VIN: Topical chemotherapy, laser ablation, wide local excision, skinning vulvectomy, and simple vulvectomy.

Enlarged, fluctuant lymph nodes should be aspirated for culture or PCR to detect H. ducreyi as well as for Gram\u2019s staining and culture to rule out the presence of other pyogenic bacteria."

            "content": "The presence of vulvar symptoms such as itching or burning may prompt a patient to seek care; however, this anatomic site is not one that is easily inspected by the patient. Thus, vulvar lesions may be found on examination that were not noticed by the patient. Vulvar self-examination should be encouraged and could potentially result in the earlier diagnosis of vulvar lesions such as melanoma. Adolescents presenting with vulvar itching may have lichen sclerosus; this condition can be relatively asymptomatic, even when an examination reveals loss of anatomic structures and scarring (11) (Fig. 14.4)."

Vulvar ulcerations in the absence of sexual activity or infectious etiology are described as vulvar aphthosis (46) (Fig. 14.10). The possibility of sexual abuse, incest, or involuntary intercourse should be considered for young adolescents with vulvovaginal symptoms, STDs, or pregnancy."
