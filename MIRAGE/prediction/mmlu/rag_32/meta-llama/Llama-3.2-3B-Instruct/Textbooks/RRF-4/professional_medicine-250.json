    "question": "After being severely beaten and sustaining a gunshot wound to the abdomen, a 42-year-old woman undergoes resection of a perforated small bowel. During the operation, plastic reconstruction of facial fractures, and open reduction and internal fixation of the left femur are also done. Thirty-six hours postoperatively, she is awake but not completely alert. She is receiving intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled pump. She says that she needs the morphine to treat her pain, but she is worried that she is becoming addicted. She has no history of substance use disorder. She drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly. Which of the following initial actions by the physician is most appropriate?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a post-surgical patient who has undergone multiple procedures, including resection of a perforated small bowel, plastic reconstruction of facial fractures, and open reduction and internal fixation of the left femur. She is currently receiving intravenous morphine for pain management. The patient is concerned about the potential for addiction to narcotics. The physician should consider the patient's concerns and take steps to minimize the risk of addiction while ensuring adequate pain management. Reassurance alone may not be sufficient, as the patient is a post-surgical patient who may be more susceptible to the risks of opioid addiction. Switching to oral acetaminophen or intramuscular lorazepam may not be appropriate, as these alternatives may not provide adequate pain relief for the patient's current level of pain. Periodic administration of intravenous naloxone may not be practical in a patient-controlled analgesia setting. Therefore, the most appropriate initial action is to educate the patient about the risks of opioid addiction and the benefits of the medication, while also monitoring her pain levels and adjusting the medication as needed. The patient-controlled analgesia pump should be set to provide a minimum dose to minimize the risk of addiction, and the physician should regularly assess the patient's pain levels and adjust the dose accordingly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

She visits her gynecologist, who obtains plasma levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, both of which are moderately elevated. She is diagnosed with premature ovarian failure, and estrogen and pro-gesterone replacement therapy is recommended. A dual-energy absorptiometry scan (DEXA) reveals a bone density t-score of <2.5 SD, ie, frank osteoporosis. How should the ovarian hormones she lacks be replaced? What extra mea-sures should she take for her osteoporosis while receiving treatment? \u25a0 THE OVARY (ESTROGENS, PROGESTINS, OTHER OVARIAN HORMONES, ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES, INHIBITORS & ANTAGONISTS, & OVULATIONINDUCING AGENTS)"

The nerve to this muscle was damaged. During the surgery on the axilla, the long thoracic nerve was damaged as it passed down the lateral thoracic wall on the external surface of the serratus anterior, just deep to the skin and subcutaneous fascia. Because the nerve was transected, it is unlikely that the patient will improve, but she was happy that she had an adequate explanation for the spike. A 25-year-old woman was involved in a motor vehicle accident and thrown from her motorcycle. When she was admitted to the emergency room, she was unconscious. A series of tests and investigations were performed, one of which included chest radiography. The attending physician noted a complex fracture of the first rib on the left. Many important structures that supply the upper limb pass over rib I."

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

A 33-year-old man was playing cricket for his local Sunday team. As the new bowler pitched the ball short, it bounced higher than he anticipated and hit him on the side of his head. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious, but after about 30 seconds he was helped to his feet and felt otherwise well. It was noted he had some bruising around his temple. He decided not to continue playing and went to watch the match from the side. Over the next hour he became extremely sleepy and was eventually unrousable. He was rushed to hospital. When he was admitted to hospital, the patient\u2019s breathing was shallow and irregular and it was necessary to intubate him. A skull radiograph demonstrated a fracture in the region of the pterion. No other abnormality was demonstrated other than minor soft tissue bruising over the left temporal fossa. A CT scan was performed."

Pain is a striking and consistent symptom and strongly suggests that an esophageal rupture has occurred, particularly if located in the cervical area following instrumentation of the esophagus, or sub-sternally in a patient with a history of resisting vomiting. If sub-cutaneous emphysema is present, the diagnosis is almost certain.Spontaneous rupture of the esophagus is associated with a high mortality rate because of the delay in recognition and treat-ment. Although there usually is a history of resisting vomiting, in a small number of patients, the injury occurs silently, without any antecedent history. When the chest radiogram of a patient with an esophageal perforation shows air or an effusion in the pleural space, the condition is often misdiagnosed as a pneumo-thorax or pancreatitis. An elevated pleural amylase caused by the extrusion of saliva through the perforation may fix"
