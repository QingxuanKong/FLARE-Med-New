There is no specific information provided about the duration for which a cannula can remain in situ, but we can look for related information in the documents. For example, document [5] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) mentions that fluid may be disseminated into the peritoneal cavity through wide-caliber arthroscopy or cystoscopy tubing using gravity pressure and an infusion cuff or a high-pressure mechanical pump. Document [8] (Title: Surgery_Schwartz) states that for CPB, heparin is given to increase the activated clotting time (ACT) to greater than 450 seconds, but it does not mention the duration for which the cannula can remain in situ. Document [9] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) mentions that complications associated with ECMO increase after 14 days, but it does not provide information on the duration for which a cannula can remain in situ. Document [21] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) mentions that vascular access sheaths are removed once the procedure is completed, but it does not specify the duration for which the cannula can remain in situ. Document [26] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) provides a list of scenarios for enteral nutrition, but it does not mention the duration for which a cannula can remain in situ. Document [30] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) mentions that insertion of the insufflation needle and primary cannula is aided by an understanding of the normal underlying anatomy, but it does not provide information on the duration for which the cannula can remain in situ. Document [31] (Title: Surgery_Schwartz) mentions that Petco2 can be persistently low during hyperventilation or with an increase in dead space, but it does not provide information on the duration for which a cannula can remain in situ. Based on the provided information, there is no clear answer to the question of how long a cannula can remain in situ. However, we can look for information on the duration of use for specific types of cannulas. For example, document [5] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) mentions that larger-diameter cannulas (8 to 15 mm) may be fitted with adapters or specialized valves that allow the insertion of smaller-diameter instruments without loss of intraperitoneal pressure. Document [9] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) mentions that small-caliber cannulas are more likely to cause injury, and document [18] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) mentions that using small-caliber cannulas can prevent inadvertent incorporation of the intestine into the wound. However, there is no information on the maximum duration for which a cannula can remain in situ. Based on the available information, we can only speculate that a cannula can remain in situ for a maximum of 24 hours, as this is a common duration for various medical procedures, but this is not a definitive answer. The correct answer cannot be determined with the provided information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

For diagnostic laparoscopy, the most useful and cosmetically acceptable site for insertion of an ancillary cannula is in the midline of the lower abdomen, about 2 to 4 cm above the symphysis. The ancillary cannula should not be inserted too close to the symphysis because it limits the mobility of the ancillary instruments and access to the cul-de-sac.

After placement of the cannulas, the pressure should be dropped to 10 to 15 mm Hg, which reduces the risk of subcutaneous insuf\ufb02ation leading to crepitus and essentially eliminates hypercarbia or decreased venous return of blood to the heart (84,86,87)."

            "content": "of intra-arterial catheterization. The incidence of thrombosis is increased when larger-caliber catheters are employed and when catheters are left in place for an extended period of time. The incidence of thrombosis can be minimized by using a 20-gauge (or smaller) catheter in the radial artery and removing the catheter as soon as feasible. The risk of distal ischemic injury can be reduced by ensuring that adequate collateral flow is present prior to catheter insertion. At the wrist, adequate collateral flow can be documented by performing a modified version of the Allen test, wherein the artery to be cannulated is digitally compressed while using a Doppler stethoscope to listen for perfusion in the palmar arch vessels.Another potential complication of intra-arterial monitor-ing is retrograde embolization of air bubbles or thrombi into the intracranial circulation. In order to minimize this risk care should be taken to avoid flushing arterial lines when air is pres-ent in the system,"

A retrograde cardioplegia catheter is a balloon-cuffed catheter that is placed through the right atrium into the coro-nary sinus and is used to perfuse the coronary circulation in the opposite direction through the venous circulation. This has the advantage of more uniform distribution in patients with diffuse coronary artery disease and is not dependent on a competent aortic valve for delivery.There is continued debate regarding the best method (ante-grade vs. retrograde vs. both), type (crystalloid vs. blood), tem-perature (cold vs. warm vs. tepid), and interval (continuous vs. intermittent) of cardioplegia delivery. The optimal combination is beyond the scope of this text. However, most cardiac surgeons in the United States favor cold blood potassium cardioplegia.CORONARY ARTERY DISEASEHistoryAortocoronary bypass for myocardial ischemia was first pro-posed and performed in laboratory animals by Carrel in 1910.26 The Vineberg operation, one of the"

            "content": "Insertion of the insuf\ufb02ation needle and primary cannula is aided by an understanding of the normal underlying anatomy, especially the location of the larger retroperitoneal vessels (Fig. 23.3). A \u201csafety zone\u201d exists inferior to the sacral promontory in the area bounded cephalad by the bifurcation of the aorta, posteriorly by the sacrum, and laterally by the iliac vessels (79). In women placed in the Trendelenburg position, the great vessels are oriented more cephalad and anterior, making them more vulnerable to injury unless appropriate adjustments are made in the angle of insertion (Fig. 23.4) (80). Therefore, positioning of the insuf\ufb02ation needle and the primary cannula is best accomplished with the patient in an unaltered supine (horizontal) position. This approach facilitates the evaluation of the upper abdomen, which is limited if the intraperitoneal contents are shifted cephalad by the head-down (Trendelenburg) position."

If the airway is connected and patent and the ventilator is functioning prop-erly, then a sudden decrease in Petco2 should prompt efforts to rule out cardiac arrest, massive pulmonary embolism, or cardio-genic shock. Petco2 can be persistently low during hyperven-tilation or with an increase in dead space such as occurs with pulmonary embolization (even in the absence of a change in QT). Causes of an increase in Petco2 include reduced minute ventilation or increased metabolic rate.RENAL MONITORINGUrine OutputBladder catheterization with an indwelling catheter allows the monitoring of urine output, usually recorded hourly by the nurs-ing staff. With a patent Foley catheter, urine output is a gross indicator of renal perfusion. The generally accepted normal urine output is 0.5 mL/kg per hour for adults and"
