    "question": "A 17-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after being stung by a bee. She has mild lightheadedness but no difficulty swallowing. Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no urticaria. Bilateral wheezing is heard on auscultation of the chest. Which of the following types of drugs is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "\u03b11-Adrenergic agonist",
        "B": "\u03b12-Adrenergic agonist",
        "C": "\u03b11-Adrenergic antagonist",
        "D": "\u03b22-Adrenergic agonist"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the scenario step by step. Step 1: Identify the key symptoms and signs presented by the patient after being stung by a bee. - Mild lightheadedness - No difficulty swallowing - Mild fever (37.1\u00b0C or 98.8\u00b0F) - Tachycardia (100/min) - Tachypnea (30/min) - Bilateral wheezing on chest auscultation - No urticaria Step 2: Analyze the symptoms and signs to determine the most likely diagnosis. - The patient's symptoms suggest an allergic reaction to the bee sting, which is consistent with anaphylaxis, a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that requires immediate medical attention. - The absence of urticaria does not rule out anaphylaxis, as not all patients exhibit urticaria in this condition. Step 3: Determine the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for anaphylaxis. - Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment with epinephrine (adrenaline) as the first-line treatment. Epinephrine works by constricting blood vessels, improving breathing, and increasing heart rate and blood pressure. Step 4: Match the most appropriate pharmacotherapy with the given options. - The options provided are \u03b11-Adrenergic agonist, \u03b12-Adrenergic agonist, \u03b11-Adrenergic antagonist, and \u03b22-Adrenergic agonist. - None of these options directly correspond to epinephrine, which is the standard treatment for anaphylaxis. - However, we need to find a drug that can help in a similar way. Epinephrine primarily acts on adrenergic receptors, with a preference for \u03b21 and \u03b11 receptors. Step 5: Choose the closest match based on the mechanism of action of the options provided. - \u03b22-Adrenergic agonists, such as albuterol, are used for bronchodilation in asthma and COPD but can also be used in anaphylaxis for their bronchodilatory effects and to help increase heart rate and blood pressure. - Although not a direct match, \u03b22-Adrenergic agonists can help alleviate some symptoms of anaphylaxis. Step 6: Select the best option from the given choices. - Given the options, the best choice is the \u03b22-Adrenergic agonist, as it can help with bronchodilation, increase heart rate, and improve blood pressure, which are all beneficial in anaphylaxis. The final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing anaphylaxis after being stung by a bee. The best choice for immediate treatment is a \u03b22-Adrenergic agonist, which can help with bronchodilation, increase heart rate, and improve blood pressure, all of which are beneficial in anaphylaxis. However, the direct treatment for anaphylaxis is epinephrine, which is not listed among the options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

A hypoxemic poisoning syndrome seen in patients who have been exposed to automobile exhaust, smoke inhalation, barbecues, or old appliances in poorly ventilated locations. Presents with hypoxemia, cherry-red skin (rare), confusion, and headaches. Coma or seizures occur in severe cases. Chronic low-level exposure may cause \ufb02 ulike symptoms with generalized myalgias, nausea, and headaches. Ask about symptoms in others living in the same house. Suspect smoke inhalation in the presence of singed nose hairs, facial burns, hoarseness, wheezing, or carbonaceous sputum. Check an ABG and serum carboxyhemoglobin level (normal is < 5% in nonsmokers and < 10% in smokers). Check an ECG in the elderly and in patients with a history of cardiac disease."

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

The patient has signs of imminent respiratory failure, including her refusal to lie down, her fear, and her tachycardia, which can-not be attributed to her minimal treatment with albuterol. Critically important immediate steps are to administer high-flow oxygen and to start albuterol by nebulization. Adding ipratropium (Atrovent) to the nebulized solution is recom-mended. A corticosteroid (0.5\u20131.0 mg/kg of methylpred-nisolone) should be administered intravenously. It is also advisable to alert the intensive care unit, because a patient with severe bronchospasm who tires can slip into respiratory failure quickly, and intubation can be difficult. Fortunately, most patients treated in hospital emergency departments do well. Asthma mortality is rare (fewer than 4000 deaths"

Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice?
