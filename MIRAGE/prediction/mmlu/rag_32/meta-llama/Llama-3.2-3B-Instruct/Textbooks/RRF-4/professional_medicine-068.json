To determine the most appropriate next step in treatment, we need to consider the pathophysiology of ankylosing spondylitis and the mechanisms of action of various drugs used to treat this condition. Ankylosing spondylitis is characterized by inflammation of the sacroiliac joints, enthesitis, and axial skeletal involvement. The disease is associated with an abnormal immune response, particularly the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1). Given the patient's lack of response to conventional treatments, we need to consider biologic agents that target specific pathways involved in the inflammatory process. TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors are a class of biologic agents that have been shown to be effective in treating ankylosing spondylitis by blocking the action of TNF-\u03b1, a key pro-inflammatory cytokine. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in treatment would be to administer a drug that inhibits TNF-\u03b1.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

It is asymmetric, polyarticular, and migratory and most often affects large joints of the upper and lower extremities. Treatment is directed at reducing bowel inflammation. In severe UC, colectomy frequently cures the arthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) occurs in about 10% of IBD patients and is more common in CD than UC. About two-thirds of IBD patients with AS express the HLA-B27 antigen. The AS activity is not related to bowel activity and does not remit with glucocorticoids or colectomy. It most often affects the spine and pelvis, producing symptoms of diffuse low-back pain, buttock pain, and morning stiffness. The course is continuous and progressive, leading to permanent skeletal damage and deformity. Anti-TNF therapy reduces spinal inflammation and improves functional status and quality of life."

Methotrexate is the DMARD of choice for the treatment of RA and is the anchor drug for most combination therapies. It was approved for the treatment of RA in 1986 and remains the benchmark for the efficacy and safety of new disease-modifying therapies. At the dosages used for the treatment of RA, methotrexate has been shown to stimulate adenosine release from cells, producing an anti-inflammatory effect. The clinical efficacy of leflunomide, an inhibitor of pyrimidine synthesis, appears similar to that of methotrexate; it has been shown in well-designed trials to be effective for the treatment of RA as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate and other DMARDs."

Biologic agents that inhibit TNF-\u03b1 and block the inflammatory cascade, including etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab, are effective in the treatment of JIA.

Aminosalicylates are associated with minimal toxicity and are available in a variety of formulations that allow for their delivery to specific regions of the alimentary tract. Thus, many continue to recommend use of mesalamine as an initial step in management of mild symptoms in patients with small bowel Crohn\u2019s disease.Orally administered glucocorticoids are used to treat patients with mild disease that does not respond to aminosalicy-lates, or as initial treatment of patients with moderate disease.

            "content": "Sulfasalazine has a high incidence of adverse effects, most of which are attributable to systemic effects of the sulfapyridine molecule. Slow acetylators of sulfapyridine have more frequent and more severe adverse effects than fast acetylators. Up to 40% of patients cannot tolerate therapeutic doses of sulfasalazine. The most common problems are dose-related and include nausea, gastrointestinal upset, headaches, arthralgias, myalgias, bone marrow suppression, and malaise. Hypersensitivity to sulfapyridine (or, rarely, 5-ASA) can result in fever, exfoliative dermatitis, pancreatitis, pneumonitis, hemolytic anemia, pericarditis, or hepatitis. Sulfasalazine has also been associated with oligospermia, which reverses upon discontinuation of the drug. Sulfasalazine impairs folate absorption and processing; hence, dietary supplementation with 1 mg/d folic acid is recommended."

The sulfapyridine is probably the active moiety when treating RA (unlike inflammatory bowel disease; see Chapter 62). Some authorities believe that the parent compound, sulfasalazine, also has an effect. Suppression of T-cell responses to concanavalin and inhibition of in vitro B-cell proliferation are documented. In vitro, sulfasalazine or its metabolites inhibit the release of inflammatory cytokines produced by monocytes or macrophages\u2014eg, IL-1, -6, and -12, and TNF-\u03b1. 2."

Nevertheless, the procedure is still widely used and some patients report relief, which is difficult to separate from the natural course of the process. A series of cases of meningitis that resulted from contaminated drug obtained wide attention but is less likely to occur in the future. Various physical therapy maneuvers and exercises may be helpful in the short run but none has been validated in comparison to others. Insofar as lumbar stenosis can cause a cauda equina syndrome, its differential diagnosis is also considered in Chap. 42 on diseases of the spinal cord. Degenerative Osteoarthritis of the Spine"
