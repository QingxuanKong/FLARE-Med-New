She does not use condoms or other contraception. The mother is concerned about her behavior. The patient's parents separated 3 months ago. She had been an honor student and excelled in sports and leadership positions at school before the separation. Since the separation, however, she has become sullen, defiant, and rebellious. She has begun smoking cigarettes, disobeying her curfew, and being truant from school. This patient is most likely using which of the following defense mechanisms?",

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the defense mechanism being used by the 14-year-old girl, let's analyze the situation step by step. The girl's behavior has changed significantly since her parents separated, becoming sullen, defiant, and rebellious. She has also started engaging in riskier behaviors such as smoking cigarettes, disobeying her curfew, and truancy from school. These changes in behavior can be seen as a way to cope with the emotional distress caused by the separation of her parents. The girl's actions can be interpreted as a way to assert her independence and autonomy, which is a common defense mechanism in adolescents during times of significant change and uncertainty. Acting out is a defense mechanism where an individual expresses unacceptable feelings or impulses in a way that is socially unacceptable, often as a way to cope with pent-up emotions. In this case, the girl's behavior can be seen as a form of acting out, as she is expressing her emotions and asserting her independence in ways that are not socially acceptable. The other options, displacement, projection, and reaction formation, do not fit as well with the context of the situation. Displacement refers to redirecting feelings or impulses from one target to another, which is not evident in this case. Projection involves attributing one's unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else, which is also not apparent in this scenario. Reaction formation involves expressing a feeling or behavior that is opposite of what one really feels, which does not fit with the girl's behavior of engaging in riskier behaviors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Perpetrators are more often male than female and include parents, relatives, teachers, family friends, members of the clergy, and other individuals who have access to children.

            "content": "Dating violence and date rape are common. It is estimated that 15% to 40% of adolescents have experienced violence in a dating relationship. Adolescent women experience higher rates of sexual assault than any other age group. An acquaintance or partner of the victim perpetrates most adolescent sexual assaults. Risk factors for date rape include initiating dating at a young age, initiating early sexual activity, and having a history of past sexual abuse or victimization. A history of child abuse by parents or siblings increases the risk of dating violence. Adolescent boys who believe that it is appropriate to strike a girl if she insults or embarrasses him or intentionally tries to make him jealous are at risk for becoming perpetrators. Date-specific factors put some teens at risk for date rape, including who initiated the date, the date activities, which person drove, and who paid."

The patient had no significant adverse effects from this dosage. At age 21, she had a second tonic-clonic seizure while in college; further discussion with her room-mate at that time revealed a history of two recent episodes of 1\u20132 minutes of altered consciousness with lip smacking (focal impaired awareness seizure, formerly complex partial seizure). A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid. Four days later, electroencephalography (EEG)"
