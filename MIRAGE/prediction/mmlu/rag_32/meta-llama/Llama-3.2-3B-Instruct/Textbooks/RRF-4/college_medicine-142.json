The use of horse-derived antibodies is a common method for providing passive immunity in emergency situations where time is of the essence. This is in contrast to active immunity, which is achieved by the body producing its own antibodies through vaccination or infection.

In Western Europe and the United States, the most common rabid species are raccoons, skunks, foxes, and bats among wild animals and dogs and cats among domestic ones. Because rabid animals commonly bite without provocation, the nature of the attack should be determined. Also, the prevalence of animal rabies virus varies widely in the United States, and local presence of the disease is useful in assessing risk. Rare cases have been caused by inhalation of the virus shed by bats; a history of spelunking suggests this mode of acquiring the infection. In a few cases the source of the infection may not be identifiable. The epidemiology and public health aspects of rabies have been reviewed by Fishbein and Robinson."

The disease manifests initially with nonspecific symptoms of malaise, headache, and fever. As the infection advances, the patient shows extraordinary CNS excitability; the slightest touch is painful, with violent motor responses progressing to convulsions. Contracture of the pharyngeal musculature may create an aversion to swallowing even water (hydrophobia). Periods of mania and stupor progress to coma and eventually death, typically from respiratory failure."

            "content": "The same risk factors for systemic infection following dog-bite wounds apply to cat-bite wounds. Pasteurella infections tend to advance rapidly, often within hours, causing severe inflammation accompanied by purulent drainage; Pasteurella may also be spread by respiratory droplets from animals, resulting in pneumonia or bacteremia. Like dog-bite wounds, cat-bite wounds may result in the transmission of rabies or in the development of tetanus. Infection with Bartonella henselae causes cat-scratch disease (Chap. 197) and is an important late consequence of cat bites and scratches. Tularemia (Chap. 195) also has been reported to follow cat bites."

            "content": "has reduced the doses needed to just 5 (from the 23 needed with DEV); these are given as 1-mL injections on the day of exposure and then on days 3, 7, 14, and 28 after the first dose. The HDCV vaccine has increased the rate of antibody response and reduced even further the allergic reactions by practically eliminating foreign protein. A thorough trial of the new antiviral agents in patients already symptomatic has not been undertaken. Persons at risk for rabies, such as animal handlers and laboratory workers, should receive preexposure vaccination with HDCV. A preventative DNA rabies vaccine has been genetically engineered and is being tested for use in animal handlers and others at high risk."
