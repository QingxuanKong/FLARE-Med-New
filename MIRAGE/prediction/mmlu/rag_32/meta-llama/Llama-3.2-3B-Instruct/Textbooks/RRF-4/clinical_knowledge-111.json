It is interesting that anaerobes inhabit many areas of the body that are exposed to air: skin, nose, mouth, and throat. Anaerobes are thought to reside in the portions of these sites that are relatively well protected from oxygen, such as gingival crevices. New technologies based on analyses of microbial DNA have expanded our knowledge of these bacterial populations. For example, in an analysis of 13,555 prokaryotic ribosomal RNA gene sequences from the colon, most bacteria identified were considered uncultivated and novel microorganisms.

These are also called commensal microorganisms, since they can have a symbiotic relationship with the host. Indeed, some commensal organisms perform important functions, as in the case of the bacteria that aid in cellulose digestion in the stomachs of ruminants. The difference between commensal organisms and pathogens lies in whether they induce damage. Even enormous numbers of microbes in the intestinal microbiome normally cause no damage and are confined within the intestinal lumen by a protective layer of mucus, whereas pathogenic bacteria can penetrate this barrier, injure intestinal epithelial cells, and spread into the underlying tissues."

These mechanisms provide a basis for understanding why patients who have received broad-spectrum antibiotics, which temporarily disrupt the colonic microbiota, are susceptible to overgrowth of pathogenic organisms and associated intestinal and systemic infections.

With progression, periodontitis may result in destruction of periodontal ligament and alveolar bone and eventual tooth loss. Periodontitis is associated with poor oral hygiene that affects the composition of gingival bacteria. Facultative Gram-positive organisms are found at healthy sites, while anaerobic and microaerophilic Gram-negative bacteria colonize plaque within areas of active periodontitis. Although about 300 bacterial species reside within the oral cavity, periodontitis is most closely associated with Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia. \u2022Cariesisthemostcommoncauseoftoothlossinindividualsyoungerthan35yearsofage.Theprimarycauseisdestructionoftoothstructurebyacidendproductsofsugarfermentationbybacteria."

Subgingival plaque is associated with periodontal infections (e.g., gingivitis, periodontitis, and periodontal abscess) that can further disseminate to adjacent structures such as the mandible, causing osteomyelitis of the maxillary sinuses. Periodontitis may also result in spreading infection that can involve adjacent bone or soft tissues. In the healthy periodontium, the sparse microbiota consists mainly of gram-positive organisms such as Streptococcus sanguinis and Actinomyces species. In the presence of gingivitis, there is a shift to a greater proportion of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli in the subgingival microbiota, with predominance of Prevotella intermedia. In well-established periodontitis, the complexity of the microbiota increases further. The predominant isolates are"

            "content": "A large number of microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi, are inhaled daily by every individual. In many cases, the microbes are inhaled in dust or aerosol particles. The distance these particles travel into the respiratory system is inversely proportional to their size. Large particles are trapped in the mucociliary blanket that lines the nose and the upper respiratory tract. Microorganisms trapped in the mucus secreted by goblet cells are transported by ciliary action to the back of the throat, where they are swallowed or coughed out. Particles smaller than 5 \u00b5m travel directly to the alveoli, where they are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages or by neutrophils recruited to the lung by cytokines."
