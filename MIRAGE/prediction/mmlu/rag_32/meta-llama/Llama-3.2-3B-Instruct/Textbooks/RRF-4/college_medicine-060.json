    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the concept of metabolism and how it is regulated. Metabolism is the sum of all the chemical changes occurring in a cell, a tissue, or the body. It involves the breakdown and synthesis of molecules, and it is controlled by various mechanisms such as allosteric regulation, covalent modification, and induction-repression of enzyme synthesis. The question asks what determines metabolism. Let's evaluate each option: Option A: size of proteins in the cell. The size of proteins in the cell does not directly determine metabolism. While proteins are essential for metabolic reactions, their size alone does not dictate the metabolic processes. Option B: availability of amino acids. The availability of amino acids is important for protein synthesis and can influence metabolic pathways, but it is not the primary determinant of metabolism. Option C: proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material. The proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material are essential for metabolic reactions, but the specific proteins formed do not determine metabolism. Option D: amino acid composition of the ribonucleic acids. The amino acid composition of ribonucleic acids (RNAs) is crucial for protein synthesis, which is a critical aspect of metabolism. However, the specific amino acid composition of RNAs does not directly determine metabolism. Considering the above points, the correct answer is not explicitly mentioned in the options. However, based on the context of the question and the general understanding of metabolism, the most relevant factor that is not listed is the genetic information encoded in the DNA, which dictates the expression of proteins involved in metabolic pathways. But since this option is not available, we have to choose the best option from the given choices. Among the options, the availability of amino acids (B) is the closest to being relevant to metabolism, but it is still not the primary determinant. Given the options, the best answer is B, but with the understanding that it is not the most accurate answer. However, since the question does not provide an option that directly addresses the genetic information or the overall metabolic processes, we are left with no choice but to select the closest relevant option.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

It represents the energy required to carry out the normal body functions, such as respiration, blood flow, and ion transport. RMR can be determined by measuring oxygen (O2) consumed or carbon dioxide (CO2) produced (indirect calorimetry). [Note: The ratio of CO2 to O2 is the respiratory quotient (RQ). It reflects the substrate being oxidized for energy (Fig. 27.6).] RMR also can be estimated using equations that include sex and age (RMR reflects lean muscle mass, which is highest in men and the young) as well as height and weight. A commonly used rough estimate is 1 kcal/kg/hour for men and 0.9 kcal/kg/hour for women. [Note: A basal metabolic rate (BMR) can be determined if more stringent environmental conditions are used, but it is not routinely done.

Ketone bodies, especially acetoacetate, are readily oxidized by the heart, and they are a major source of energy in diabetic acidosis. As is true of carbohydrate substrates, use of a specific noncarbohydrate is influenced by the presence of other substrates, whether noncarbohydrate or carbohydrate. Therefore, within certain limits, the heart preferentially uses the substrate that is available in the largest concentration. The oxidation of amino acids makes a small contribution to myocardial energy expenditure. Normally, the heart derives its energy by oxidative phosphorylation, in which each mole of glucose yields 36 mol of ATP.

All fuel originates from the diet, but humans do not eat in a nonstop manner all day long.

Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis in cells with mitochondria and an adequate supply of O2. This series of ten reactions is called aerobic glycolysis because O2 is required to reoxidize the NADH formed during the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Fig. 8.9B). Aerobic glycolysis sets the stage for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, a major fuel of the TCA cycle.

            "content": "VIII. ENZYME REGULATION The regulation of the reaction velocity of enzymes is essential if an organism is to coordinate its numerous metabolic processes. The rates of most enzymes are responsive to changes in substrate concentration, because the intracellular level of many substrates is in the range of the Km. Thus, an increase in substrate concentration prompts an increase in reaction rate, which tends to return the concentration of substrate toward normal. In addition, some enzymes with specialized regulatory functions respond to allosteric effectors and/or covalent modification or they show altered rates of enzyme synthesis (or degradation) when physiologic conditions are changed.

During the digestive phase, absorbed fuels are partitioned and used for different purposes. Insulin (discussed in detail later) regulates essentially every aspect of metabolism during the digestive phase. Glucose is the primary fuel used for energy (i.e., ATP production) during the digestive phase ( Fig. 39.3A ). Glucose is considered a universal fuel in that most cells can perform the following: 1. 2. \u201ctrap\u201d and \u201cactivate\u201d imported glucose by converting glucose into glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) through the activity of one or more hexokinases. G6P cannot pass through GLUT transporters (\u201ctrapping\u201d) and is now a substrate for several enzymatic pathways (\u201cactivation\u201d). 3."
