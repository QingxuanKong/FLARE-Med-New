    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to understand the functions of the glossopharyngeal nerve and the effects of damaging this nerve. The glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) is responsible for several functions, including taste sensation from the posterior third of the tongue, sensation of the posterior wall of the pharynx, and motor functions such as swallowing. The question asks about the effects of a malignant tumor damaging the glossopharyngeal nerve. Let's evaluate each option given in the context of the functions of the glossopharyngeal nerve. Option A: Loss of taste over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is incorrect because the glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for taste sensation from the posterior third of the tongue, not the anterior two-thirds. This function is carried by the facial nerve (VII) via the chorda tympani nerve. Option B: Loss of somesthetic sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is also incorrect for the same reason as option A. The glossopharyngeal nerve carries sensation to the posterior third of the tongue, not the anterior two-thirds. Option C: Loss of taste and somesthetic sensation over the posterior third of the tongue is correct because the glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for carrying taste sensation from the posterior third of the tongue and sensation of the posterior wall of the pharynx. A malignant tumor damaging the glossopharyngeal nerve would likely result in the loss of these functions. Option D: Paralysis of the muscles of the tongue is incorrect because the glossopharyngeal nerve does not primarily control the muscles of the tongue. The hypoglossal nerve (XII) controls tongue movement, and the facial nerve (VII) controls muscles of facial expression, among other functions. The glossopharyngeal nerve's primary role is not in motor functions of the tongue. Therefore, the correct answer is C, as it accurately reflects the functions of the glossopharyngeal nerve and the expected effects of damaging this nerve by a malignant tumor.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",

A similar high rate of success has been achieved by others. If syncope is associated with the pain, it can be expected to cease with abolition of the attacks of pain.

Hoarseness as a result of vocal cord paralysis, some difficulty in swallowing, deviation of the soft palate to the sound side, anesthesia of the posterior wall of the pharynx, and weakness of the upper trapezius and sternomastoid muscles make up the clinical picture (see Table 44-1, jugular foramen syndrome).

However, an isolated lesion of the ninth cranial nerve is a rarity and therefore the effects are not fully known. In one personally observed case of bilateral surgical interruption of the ninth nerves, verified at autopsy, there had been no demonstrable loss of taste or other sensory or motor impairment. This suggests that the tenth nerve may be responsible for these functions, at least in some individuals. The role of the ninth nerve in the reflex control of blood pressure and ventilation has been alluded to earlier but referable clinical manifestations from damage of this cranial nerve are infrequent except perhaps for syncope as noted below."

Often the episodes are unpredictable, but some patients find that turning the head stimulates an attack. The mechanism in one of our patients with cervical adenopathy was primarily a vasodepressor response; patients with prominent bradycardia have generally had tumors that directly surrounded or infiltrated the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves (Frank et al; see also MacDonald et al). If the tumor can be safely removed from the carotid region, the syncope often abates; in many cases, however, intracranial section of the ninth and upper rootlets of the tenth nerves on the side of the mass is necessary."

It is far less common than trigeminal neuralgia. Sometimes the pain overlaps the vagal territory beneath the angle of the jaw and external auditory meatus. It may be triggered by coughing, sneezing, swallowing, and pressure on the tragus of the ear. Temporary blocking of the pain by anesthetizing the tonsillar fauces and posterior pharynx with 10 percent lidocaine spray is diagnostic. Rarely, herpes zoster may involve the glossopharyngeal nerve. Fainting as a manifestation of vagoglossopharyngeal neuralgia is described in Chap. 9."

A full head and neck examination including inspection and palpation is critical for nearly all head and neck cancers. Oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers should be palpated when possible to provide additional tactile informa-tion regarding depth of invasion, mobility, and invasion into adjacent structures.

In the pediatric population, there can be neurologic causes, the most common of which is the Arnold-Chiari malformation.51 Overall, the left vocal cord is more commonly involved secondary to the longer course of the RLN on that side. Other rare etiologies include trauma, intu-bation injury, atypical infections, and neurotoxic medications. Patients typically present with a weak breathy voice and may have aspiration secondary to diminished supraglottic sensa-tion if the proximal vagal nerve or superior laryngeal nerve is involved. RLN injury is also associated with delayed relaxation Figure 18-14.
