A nucleosome is a basic unit of chromatin structure that consists of a protein core made up of eight histone proteins (two molecules each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) and a length of DNA that is wrapped around the core. The DNA is typically 147 nucleotide pairs long and is known as linker DNA. The histone proteins are not directly digested by DNase, but rather the linker DNA is digested. This is because DNase is an enzyme that breaks down DNA, and the linker DNA is the part of the nucleosome that is exposed and can be accessed by DNase. The histone proteins, on the other hand, are part of the nucleosome core and are not directly digested by DNase. Therefore, the correct answer is the linker DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

After digestion for a short period, the exposed DNA between the nucleosome core particles, the linker DNA, is degraded. Each individual nucleosome core particle consists of a complex of eight histone proteins\u2014two molecules each of histones H2A, Figure 4\u201320 Chromatin. As illustrated, chromatin consists of DNA bound to both histone and non-histone proteins. The mass of histone protein present is about equal to the total mass of non-histone protein, but\u2014as schematically indicated here\u2014the latter class is composed of an enormous number of different species. In total, a chromosome is about one-third DNA and two-thirds protein by mass."

In biochemical experiments, the nucleosome core particle can be released from isolated chromatin by digestion of the linker DNA with a nuclease, an enzyme that breaks down DNA. (The nuclease can degrade the exposed linker DNA but cannot attack the DNA wound tightly around the nucleosome core.) After dissociation of the isolated nucleosome into its protein core and DNA, the length of the DNA that was wound around the core can be determined. This length of 147 nucleotide pairs is sufficient to wrap 1.7 times around the histone core."

Some bound proteins favor the formation of a nucleosome adjacent to them. Others create obstacles that force the nucleosomes to move elsewhere. The exact positions of nucleosomes along a stretch of DNA therefore depend mainly on the presence and nature of other proteins bound to the DNA. And due to the presence of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, the arrangement of nucleosomes on DNA can be highly dynamic, changing rapidly according to the needs of the cell."

The nucleosome is composed of an octameric core of histone proteins around which the DNA double helix is wrapped. Nucleosomes are spaced at intervals of about 200 nucleotide pairs, and they are usually packed together (with the aid of histone H1 molecules) into quasi-regular arrays to form a 30-nm chromatin fiber. Even though compact, the structure of chromatin must be highly dynamic to allow access to the DNA. There is some spontaneous DNA unwrapping and rewrapping in the nucleosome itself; however, the general strategy for reversibly changing local chromatin structure features ATP-driven chromatin remodeling complexes. Cells contain a large set of such complexes, which are targeted to specific regions of chromatin at appropriate times.

If true, this would pose problems for genetic readout mechanisms, which in principle require easy access to many specific DNA sequences. It would also hinder the rapid passage of the DNA transcription and replication machinery through chromatin. But kinetic experiments show that the DNA in an isolated nucleosome unwraps from each end at a rate of about four times per second, remaining exposed for 10 to 50 milliseconds before the partially unwrapped structure recloses. Thus, most of the DNA in an isolated nucleosome is in principle available for binding other proteins."

These complexes include a subunit that hydrolyzes ATP (an ATPase evolutionarily related to the DNA helicases discussed in Chapter 5). This subunit binds both to the protein core of the nucleosome and to the double-stranded DNA that winds around it. By using the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move this DNA relative to the core, the protein complex changes the structure of a nucleosome temporarily, making the DNA less tightly bound to the histone core. Through repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis that pull the nucleosome core along the DNA double helix, the remodeling complexes can catalyze nucleosome sliding. In this way, they can reposition nucleosomes to expose specific regions of DNA, thereby making them available to other proteins in the cell (Figure 4\u201326).

The reestablishment of nucleosomes behind a moving fork occurs in an intriguing way. When a nucleosome is traversed by a replication fork, the histone octamer appears to be broken into an H3-H4 tetramer and two H2A-H2B dimers (discussed in Chapter 4). The H3-H4 tetramer remains loosely associated with DNA and is distributed at random to one or the other daughter duplex, but the H2A-H2B dimers are released completely from DNA.

All four of the histones that make up the core of the nucleosome are relatively small proteins (102\u2013135 amino acids), and they share a structural motif, known as the histone fold, formed from three \u03b1 helices connected by two loops (Figure 4\u201324). In assembling a nucleosome, the histone folds first bind to each other to form H3\u2013H4 and H2A\u2013H2B dimers, and the H3\u2013H4 dimers combine to form tetramers.

Active chromatin contains histone proteins that have been covalently modified at their amino terminal ends by reversible methylation, acetylation, or phosphorylation (see p. 438 for a discussion of histone acetylation/deacetylation by histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase). Such modifications decrease the positive charge of these basic proteins, thereby decreasing the strength of their association with negatively charged DNA.

The chromatin of eukaryotes gets decondensed (relaxed) for replication. Relaxation can be accomplished, for example, by acetylation via histone acetyltransferases. Prokaryotes have more than one DNA pol. For example, pol III extends the RNA primer with DNA, and pol I removes the primer and replaces it with DNA. Replication is initiated at specific locations (one in prokaryotes, many in eukaryotes) that are recognized by proteins (for example, DnaA in prokaryotes).

            "content": "The production of chromatin proteins increases during S phase to provide the raw materials needed to package the newly synthesized DNA. Most importantly, S-Cdks stimulate a large increase in the synthesis of the four histone subunits that form the histone octamers at the core of each nucleosome. These subunits are assembled into nucleosomes on the DNA by nucleosome assembly factors, which typically associate with the replication fork and distribute nucleosomes on both strands of the DNA as they emerge from the DNA synthesis machinery."

            "content": "The association of DNA with histones to form nucleosomes (see p. 425) affects the ability of the transcription machinery to access the DNA to be transcribed. Most actively transcribed genes are found in a relatively decondensed form of chromatin called euchromatin, whereas most inactive segments of DNA are found in highly condensed heterochromatin. The interconversion of these forms is called chromatin remodeling. A major component of chromatin remodeling is the covalent modification of histones (for example, the acetylation of lysine residues at the amino terminus of histone proteins), as shown in Figure 31.11. Acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferases (HAT), eliminates the positive charge on the lysine, thereby decreasing the interaction of the histone with the negatively charged DNA. Removal of the acetyl group by histone deacetylases (HDAC) restores the positive charge and fosters stronger interactions between histones and DNA. [Note: The ATP-dependent repositioning of"

            "content": "The smallest units of chromatin structure are macromolecular complexes of DNA and histones called nucleosomes. Nucleosomes are found in both euchromatin and heterochromatin and in chromosomes. These 10-nm-diameter particles represent the first level of chromatin folding and are formed by the coiling of the DNA molecule around a protein core. This step shortens the DNA molecule by approximately sevenfold relative to the unfolded DNA molecule. The core of the nucleosome consists of eight histone molecules (called an octamer). Two loops of DNA (approximately 146 nucleotide pairs) are wrapped around the core octomer. The DNA extends between each particle as a 2-nm filament that joins adjacent nucleosomes. When chromatin is extracted from the nucleus, the nucleosomal substructure of chromatin is visible in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and is often described as \u201cbeads on a string\u201d (Fig. 3.2a)."
