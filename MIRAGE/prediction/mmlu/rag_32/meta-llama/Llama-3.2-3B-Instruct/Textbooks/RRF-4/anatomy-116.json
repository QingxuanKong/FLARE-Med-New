Sog encodes another secreted protein that is produced by the neurogenic ectoderm (which gives rise to the nervous system) and acts as an antagonist of Dpp protein. The opposing diffusion gradients of these two signal proteins create a steep gradient of Dpp activity: the highest Dpp activity levels, in combination with certain other factors, cause development of the most dorsal tissue of all\u2014an extraembryonic membrane.

Fusion of the tube starts at the midpoint and extends cranially and caudally so that the tube is fully formed by the fourth week. Continued proliferation of the cells at the cephalic end cause the neural tube to dilate and form the three primary brain vesicles (eFig. 9.4): the prosencephalon (forebrain), mesencephalon (midbrain), and rhombencephalon (hindbrain), which later give rise to the structures of the brain.

Then, when the neural crest cells migrate away from the neural tube, these cadherins become scarcely detectable, and another cadherin (cadherin 7) appears that helps hold the migrating cells together as loosely associated cell groups (Figure 19\u20138C).

            "content": "The frog\u2019s dorsal signaling system uses a different set of secreted signals from that of the vegetal signaling system to subdivide the germ-layer territories according to location along the D-V axis of the embryo. It exerts its influence by secreting two inhibitory signal proteins, called Chordin and Noggin. These antagonize the action of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs; members of yet another subclass of the TGF\u03b2 family), which themselves are secreted throughout the embryo. In this way, Chordin and Noggin form a dorsal-to-ventral gradient that blocks BMP signaling on the dorsal side but allows it to remain high on the ventral side (Figure 21\u201330B). Ectodermal cells that experience high levels of BMP signaling are driven to epidermal fates, whereas cells that experience little or no BMP signaling remain neural."

If ES or iPS cells are implanted directly into an embryo at a later stage or into an adult tissue, however, they fail to receive the appropriate sequence of cues; their differentiation then is not properly controlled, and they will often give rise to a tumor of the type known as a teratoma, containing a mixture of cell types inappropriate to the site in the body."

The neural canal forms the cavities of the ventricular system in the brain and central canal of the spinal cord (eTable 9.1). The peripheral nervous system consists of cranial nerves, spinal nerves, spinal ganglia, the enteric system, and autonomic ganglia. The peripheral nervous system is formed by nerve fibers that extend out of the central nervous system and by neurons and their fibers that develop from migratory neural crest cells (eFig. 9.4A). Like the neural tube, neural crest cells originate from surface ectoderm and initially lie on each side of the developing CNS."

It is singled out by lateral inhibition and emerges from the basal (internal) face of the ectoderm. It then goes through repeated division cycles, dividing asymmetrically to generate a series of ganglion mother cells. each ganglion mother cell divides just once to give a pair of differentiated daughters (typically a neuron plus a glial cell). freshwater sticklebacks have lost this expression as a result of a change at the Pitx1 locus. These changes do not lie in the coding sequence. Instead, each is a small deletion of a block of adjacent regulatory DNA that controls Pitx1 expression specifically in the pelvic cells (Figure 21\u201337)."
