    "question": "A 27-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 12 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit. She feels well. Pregnancy and delivery of her first child were uncomplicated. Medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), and blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 12-week gestation. Urine dipstick shows leukocyte esterase; urinalysis shows WBCs and rare gram-negative rods. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "A": "Recommend drinking 8 oz of cranberry juice daily",

        "D": "Intravenous cefazolin therapy"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is at 12 weeks' gestation and presents with a urinalysis showing WBCs and rare gram-negative rods, which suggests a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is asymptomatic, but the presence of leukocyte esterase on the dipstick test indicates the presence of an infection. The next step in management should be to initiate antibiotic therapy to treat the UTI and prevent potential complications. The choice of antibiotic should cover the likely causative organisms, which in this case are gram-negative rods. Oral amoxicillin-clavulanate is a commonly used antibiotic for UTIs, but in pregnancy, it is recommended to use a different antibiotic to minimize the risk of allergic reactions. Oral metronidazole is not typically used for UTIs in pregnancy. Intravenous cefazolin is typically used for surgical prophylaxis, not for treating UTIs. Cranberry juice is not an effective treatment for UTIs. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends oral amoxicillin-clavulanate as a first-line treatment for UTIs in pregnancy, but due to the risk of allergic reactions, the recommended alternative is oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. However, since this option is not available, the next best option is oral amoxicillin-clavulanate, but with caution and monitoring for potential allergic reactions. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is oral amoxicillin-clavulanate therapy with caution and monitoring.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Early morphological changes usually include neutrophils that are hypersegmented and newly formed erythrocytes that are macrocytic. With preexisting iron deiciency, macrocytic erythrocytes cannot be detected by measurement of the mean corpuscular volume. Careful examination of a peripheral blood smear, however, usually demonstrates some macrocytes. As the anemia becomes more intense, peripheral nucleated erythrocytes appear, and bone marrow examination discloses megaloblastic erythropoiesis.

            "content": "Other than bacterial vaginosis, the most common bacterial infections during pregnancy involve the urinary tract (Chap. 162). Many pregnant women have asymptomatic bacteriuria, most likely due to stasis caused by progestational effects on ureteral and bladder smooth muscle and later in pregnancy due to compression effects of the enlarging uterus. In itself, this condition is not associated with an adverse outcome of pregnancy. However, if asymptomatic bacteriuria is left untreated, symptomatic pyelonephritis may occur. Indeed, ~75% of pregnancy-associated pyelonephritis cases are the result of untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria. All pregnant women should be screened with a urine culture for asymptomatic bacteriuria at the first prenatal visit. Subsequent screening with nitrite/leukocyte esterase strips is indicated for high-risk women, such as those with sickle cell trait or a history of urinary tract infections. All women with positive screens should be treated. Pregnant women who"

Because the initial 1 to 2 mL of fluid aspirate may be contaminated with maternal cells, it is generally discarded. Approximately 20 to 30 mL of fluid is then collected for either fetal CMA or karyotyping before removing the needle.

A urine culture is recommended by most because treating bacteruria signiicantly reduces the likelihood of developing symptomatic urinary tract infections in pregnancy (Chap. 53, p. 1026)."
