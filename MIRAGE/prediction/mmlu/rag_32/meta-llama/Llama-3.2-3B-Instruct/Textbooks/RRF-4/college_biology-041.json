Low-speed centrifugation is typically used to separate components based on density differences. The key is to identify which organelles have distinct densities that would allow them to separate when centrifuged at low speed. Let's evaluate each option: Option A: DNA and mRNA - Both DNA and mRNA are relatively dense, but they are not distinct enough in density to be separated by low-speed centrifugation. Option B: Nuclei and secretory vesicles - Nuclei are dense due to the high concentration of DNA, but secretory vesicles are also relatively dense. They are not distinct enough in density to be separated by low-speed centrifugation. Option C: Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum - The Golgi apparatus is generally less dense than the endoplasmic reticulum, which is composed of membranous tubules and cisternae. The endoplasmic reticulum is less dense due to its membranous structure. Option D: Lysosomes and endosomes - Both lysosomes and endosomes are relatively dense organelles, but they are not distinct enough in density to be separated by low-speed centrifugation. Considering the properties of each organelle, the most suitable pair for separation by low-speed centrifugation is the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, as the endoplasmic reticulum is less dense than the Golgi apparatus. answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

(A) In velocity sedimentation, subcellular components sediment at different speeds according to their size and shape when layered over a solution containing sucrose. To stabilize the sedimenting bands against convective mixing caused by small differences in temperature or solute concentration, the tube contains a continuous shallow gradient of sucrose, which increases in concentration toward the bottom of the tube (typically from 5% to 20% sucrose). After centrifugation, the different components can be collected individually, most simply by puncturing the plastic centrifuge tube with a needle and collecting drops from the bottom, as illustrated here."

A finer degree of separation can be achieved by layering the homogenate in a thin band on top of a salt solution that fills a centrifuge tube. When centrifuged, the various components in the mixture move as a series of distinct bands through the solution, each at a different rate, in a process called velocity sedimentation (Figure 8\u20137A). For the procedure to work effectively, the bands must be protected from convective mixing, which would normally occur whenever a denser solution (for example, one containing organelles) finds itself on top of a lighter one (the salt solution). This is achieved by augmenting the solution in the tube with a shallow gradient of sucrose prepared by a special mixing device. The resulting density gradient\u2014with the dense end at the bottom of the tube\u2014keeps each region of the solution denser than any solution above it, and it thereby prevents"

Such cell fractionations became possible only after the commercial development in the early 1940s of an instrument known as the preparative ultracentrifuge, which rotates extracts of broken cells at high speeds (Figure 8\u20135). This treatment separates cell components by size and density: in general, the largest objects experience the largest centrifugal force and move the most rapidly. At relatively low speed, large components such as nuclei sediment to form a pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube; at slightly higher speed, a pellet of mitochondria is deposited; and at even higher speeds and with longer periods of centrifugation, first the small closed vesicles and then the ribosomes can be collected (Figure 8\u20136). All of these fractions are impure, but many of the contaminants can be removed by resuspending the pellet and repeating the centrifugation procedure several times."

Rapid rotation of the rotor generates enormous centrifugal forces, which cause particles in the sample to sediment against the bottom sides of the sample tubes, as shown here. The vacuum reduces friction, preventing heating of the rotor and allowing the refrigeration system to maintain the sample at 4\u00b0C. (B) Some fractionation methods require a different type of rotor called a swinging-bucket rotor. In this case, the sample tubes are placed in metal tubes on hinges that allow the tubes to swing outward when the rotor spins. Sample tubes are therefore horizontal during spinning, and samples are sedimented toward the bottom, not the sides, of the tube, providing better separation of differently sized components (see Figures 8\u20136 and 8\u20137)."

This method, called equilibrium sedimentation, is so sensitive that it can separate macromolecules that have incorporated heavy isotopes, such as 13C or 15N, from the same macromolecules that contain the lighter, common isotopes (12C or 14N). In fact, the cesium-chloride method was developed in 1957 to separate the labeled from the unlabeled DNA produced after exposure of a growing population of bacteria to nucleotide precursors containing 15N; this classic experiment provided direct evidence for the semiconservative replication of DNA (see Figure 5\u20135)."

Every protein has a characteristic isoelectric point, the pH at which the protein has no net charge and therefore does not migrate in an electric field.

A complementary approach relies on the hydrodynamic properties of a complex; that is, its behavior as it moves through a liquid medium. Usually, two separate measurements are made. One measure is the velocity of a complex as it moves under the influence of a centrifugal field produced by an ultracentrifuge (see Figure 8\u20137A).

            "content": "Molecular weight can also be determined more directly by using an analytical ultracentrifuge, a complex device that allows protein absorbance measurements to be made on a sample while it is subjected to centrifugal forces. In this approach, the sample is centrifuged until it reaches equilibrium, where the centrifugal force on a protein complex exactly balances its tendency to diffuse away. Because this balancing point is dependent on a complex\u2019s molecular weight but not on its particular shape, the molecular weight can be directly calculated."

            "content": "Cultures prepared directly from the tissues of an organism are called primary cultures. These can be made with or without an initial fractionation step to separate different cell types. In most cases, cells in primary cultures can be removed from the culture dish and recultured repeatedly in so-called secondary cultures; in this way, they can be repeatedly subcultured (passaged) for weeks or months. Such cells often display many of the differentiated properties appropriate to their Figure 8\u20132 A fluorescence-activated cell sorter. A cell passing through the laser beam is monitored for fluorescence. Droplets containing single cells are given a negative or positive charge, depending on whether the cell is fluorescent or not. The droplets are then deflected by an electric field into collection tubes according to their charge. Note that the cell concentration must be adjusted so that most droplets contain no cells and flow to a waste container together with any cell clumps."

The proteins were first separated on the basis of their isoelectric points by isoelectric focusing in the horizontal dimension. They were then further fractionated according to their molecular mass by electrophoresis from top to bottom in the presence of SDS. Note that different proteins are present in very different amounts. The bacteria were fed with a mixture of radioisotope-labeled amino acids so that all of their proteins were radioactive and could be detected by autoradiography.

Placing the membrane over the gel and driving the proteins out of the gel with a strong electric current transfers the protein onto the membrane. The membrane is then soaked in a solution of labeled antibody to reveal the protein of interest. This method of detecting proteins"

In this example, a homogenate of cells was first fractionated by allowing it to percolate through an ion-exchange resin packed into a column (A). The column was washed to remove all unbound contaminants, and the bound proteins were then eluted by pouring a solution containing a gradually increasing concentration of salt onto the top of the column. Proteins with the lowest affinity for the ion-exchange resin passed directly through the column and were collected in the earliest fractions eluted from the bottom of the column. The remaining proteins were eluted in sequence according to their affinity for the resin\u2014those proteins binding most tightly to the resin requiring the highest concentration of salt to remove them. The protein of interest was eluted in several fractions and was detected by its enzymatic activity. The"
