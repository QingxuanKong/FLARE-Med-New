The extradural space is located between the skull bones and the dura mater. The dura mater is a thick, fibrous membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.

The extradural space is the space between the dura mater and the innermost layer, the pia mater.

High-risk patients include those with persistent depressed or decreasing level of consciousness, focal neurologic signs, penetrating skull injury, depressed skull fractures, or worsening symptoms. Because patients with intracranial hemorrhage may progressively deteriorate and require immediate neurosurgical care, these patients warrant care in a skilled trauma center. The Glasgow Coma Scale is a valuable tool for monitoring the course of patients after trauma for signs of deterioration (Chapter 42). Management includes ensuring an appropriate airway, breathing, and circulation. Neuroimaging with CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and skull and cervical spine radiographs are obtained emergently. Neuroimaging is not necessary for uncomplicated concussions but should be employed whenever suspicion of structural intracranial lesion exists."

If imaging shows no subarachnoid blood (a common finding) or intraparenchymal clot or contusion, and the patient is mentally clear there is little chance of developing an extradural hemorrhage. The presence of a fracture may increase these odds but most studies, such as the one by Lloyd and colleagues, have found that the presence of a skull fracture in children proves to be a relatively poor indicator of intracranial injury. The exception is a fracture through the squamous bone and the groove of the middle meningeal artery, which represents a risk for arterial bleeding and epidural hemorrhage."

Blood collects between the periosteal layer of the dura and the calvaria and under arterial pressure slowly expands. The typical history is of a blow to the head (often during a sporting activity) that produces a minor loss of consciousness. Following the injury the patient usually regains consciousness and has a lucid interval for a period of hours. After this, rapid drowsiness and unconsciousness ensue, which may lead to death."

If a patient survives this period, his chances of dying from complications of these effects are greatly reduced. The mortality rate of those who reach the hospital in coma is approximately 20 percent, and most of the deaths occur in the first 12 to 24 h as a result of direct injury to the brain in combination with other nonneurologic injuries. Of those alive at 24 h, the overall mortality falls to 7 to 8 percent; after 48 h, only 1 to 2 percent of patients succumb. There is some evidence that transfer of such patients to an intensive care unit, where personnel experienced in the handling of head injury can monitor them, improves the chances for survival (see further on)."

Furthermore, the notion that a normal CT scan excludes an anatomic lesion as the cause of coma is erroneous. Bilateral hemisphere infarction, acute brainstem infarction, encephalitis, meningitis, mechanical shearing of axons as a result of closed head trauma, sagittal sinus thrombosis, and subdural hematoma isodense to adjacent brain are some of the disorders that may not be detected.

Acute subdural hematoma may be combined with epidural hemorrhage, cerebral contusion, or laceration.

Subdural clots more than a few millimeter in thickness can be accurately visualized by the CT scan in more than 90 percent of cases, but the window settings must be appropriate to avoid obscuring of the clot by adjacent bone (Fig. 34-9).

As one would expect, the interval between loss of consciousness and the surgical drainage of the clot is perhaps the most important determinant of outcome in serious cases. Thin, crescentic clots can be observed and followed over several weeks and surgery undertaken only if focal signs or indications of increasing ICP arise (headache, vomiting, and bradycardia).

            "content": "The need for surgical intervention during the acute posttraumatic period is decided by two factors: the clinical status of the patient and the findings on imaging. The presence of a subdural or epidural clot that is causing a shift of central brain structures calls for evacuation of the collection. The approach to these lesions has been discussed earlier. Should the elevated ICP not respond to this procedure or to the standard osmotic agents and other medical measures outlined earlier, or should the condition of the patient and vital signs then begin to deteriorate (heart rate rising, temperature rising or falling below normal, state of consciousness worsening, hemiplegia, plantar reflexes more clearly extensor), a renewed search must be undertaken for a late-occurring cerebral hemorrhage. Usually in these clinical circumstances, CT scanning will disclose a new or enlarged epidural, subdural, or intracerebral hematoma, or worsened cerebral edema. If death or severe disability is to be"

            "content": "This group is smaller than the other two but is of importance because it includes a disproportionate number of patients who are in urgent need of surgical treatment. The initial loss of consciousness from concussion may have lasted only a few minutes or, exceptionally, there may have been no period of unresponsiveness at all, in which instance one might wrongly conclude that there was no concussion and little possibility of traumatic hemorrhage or other type of brain injury. Patients who display this sequence of events, in the past referred to vividly as \u201ctalk and die\u201d by Marshall and associates (1983), have late deterioration because of the expansion of a subdural hematoma, worsening brain edema around a contusion, or the delayed appearance of an epidural clot. Among 34 such patients in the Traumatic Coma Data Bank who had this type of lucid interval, the majority showed substantial degrees of midline shift on the initial CT scan, reflecting the presence of early brain edema and"

            "content": "A CT scan was performed. The CT scan demonstrated a lentiform area of high density within the left cranial fossa. A diagnosis of extradural hemorrhage was made. Fractures in the region of the pterion are extremely dangerous. A division of the middle meningeal artery passes deep to this structure and is subject to laceration and disruption, especially in conjunction with a skull injury in this region. In this case the middle meningeal artery was torn and started to bleed, producing a large extradural clot. The patient\u2019s blood pressure began to increase."
