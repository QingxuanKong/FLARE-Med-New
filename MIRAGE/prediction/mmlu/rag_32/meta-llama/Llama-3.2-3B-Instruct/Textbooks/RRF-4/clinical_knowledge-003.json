Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that can affect multiple body systems. The symptoms of anaphylaxis can be remembered using the acronym \\\"ANAPHYLAXIS\\\", with each letter standing for a symptom: A - Absence of breath, N - Nose congestion, A - Absence of pulse, P - Pale skin, H - Hoarseness, Y - You in shock, L - Lack of movement, A - Absence of urine output, X - eXhaustion, I - Inability to speak, S. Given these symptoms, we can evaluate each option in the context of anaphylaxis.\\n\\nOption A, Stridor, is a symptom of anaphylaxis. It refers to a high-pitched sound that occurs during breathing, often due to airway obstruction. This is consistent with anaphylaxis, which can cause respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing.\\n\\nOption B, Bradycardia, is a symptom that is NOT typically associated with anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is more commonly associated with tachycardia, or a rapid heart rate, due to the release of histamine and other mediators that stimulate the heart. Bradycardia, or a slow heart rate, is not a characteristic symptom of anaphylaxis.\\n\\nOption C, Severe wheeze, is a symptom of anaphylaxis. Wheezing is a common respiratory symptom of anaphylaxis, caused by the constriction of airways and inflammation.\\n\\nOption D, Rash, can be a symptom of anaphylaxis. Urticaria, or hives, is a common skin symptom of anaphylaxis, caused by the release of histamine and other mediators.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is B. Bradycardia is NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

While administration of oral penicillin to an allergic individual can also cause anaphylaxis, the symptoms after oral ingestion are usually less severe and very rarely result in death.

Type III Immune complex: Antigen-antibody complexes activate complement, which attracts neutrophils; neutrophils release lysosomal enzymes. Examples include polyarteritis nodosa, immune complex glomerulonephritis, SLE, and rheumatoid arthritis."

            "content": "An immediate hypersensitivity reaction may occur as a systemic disorder or as a local reaction ( Table 5.3 ). The route of antigen exposure often determines the nature of the reaction. Systemic exposure to protein antigens (e.g., in bee venom) or drugs (e.g., penicillin) may result in systemic anaphylaxis. Within minutes of the exposure in a sensitized host, itching, urticaria (hives), and skin erythema appear, followed in short order by profound respiratory difficulty caused by pulmonary bronchoconstriction and accentuated by hypersecretion of mucus. Laryngeal edema may exacerbate matters by causing upper airway obstruction. In addition, the musculature of the entire gastrointestinal tract may be affected, with resultant vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. Without immediate intervention, there may be systemic vasodilation with a fall Table 5.3 Examples of Disorders Caused by Immediate Hypersensitivity"

            "content": "Anaphylactic shock and related immediate (type I) IgE-mediated reactions affect both the respiratory and the cardiovascular systems. The syndrome of bronchospasm, mucous membrane congestion, angioedema, and severe hypotension usually responds rapidly to the parenteral administration of epinephrine, 0.3\u20130.5 mg (0.3\u20130.5 mL of a 1:1000 epinephrine solution). Intramuscular injection may be the preferred route of administration, since skin blood flow (and hence systemic drug absorption from subcutaneous injection) is unpredictable in hypotensive patients. In some patients with impaired cardiovascular function, intravenous injection of epinephrine may be required. The use of epinephrine for anaphylaxis precedes the era of controlled clinical trials, but extensive experimental and clinical experience supports its use as the agent of choice. Epinephrine activates \u03b1, \u03b21, and \u03b22 receptors, all of which may be important in reversing the pathophysiologic processes underlying anaphylaxis. It is"

In contrast, for long-term risk reduction, avoidance measures and immunomodulation are trigger-specific; currently immunomodulation is available only for a minority of individuals with anaphylaxis. All at-risk individuals need to have comorbidities and comedications assessed, be taught the importance of emergency preparedness, and be instructed in the use of self-injectable epinephrine.
