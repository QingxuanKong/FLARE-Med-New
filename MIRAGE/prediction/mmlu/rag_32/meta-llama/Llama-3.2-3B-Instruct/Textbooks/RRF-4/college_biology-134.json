According to document [2], mtDNA mutates at a rate that is roughly 100 times greater than the nuclear genome.\\n\\nOption B: mtDNA is passed from mother to child and is free from recombination that occurs between pairs of chromosomes. This is correct. mtDNA is maternally inherited, meaning it is passed from mother to child, and it does not undergo recombination like nuclear DNA.\\n\\nOption C: There are few single nucleotide polymorphisms in the hypervariable, noncoding regions. This is not a reason why geneticists use mtDNA to study relatedness. In fact, document [1] mentions that mtDNA has a high mutation rate, which allows for the estimation of recent evolutionary events.\\n\\nOption D: All mitochondrial proteins are coded for by mitochondrial genes. This is not accurate.

The random occurrence of mutations in the mtDNA sequence should yield a more uniform distribution of disease-causing mutations. However, recent studies using the introduction of one severe and one mild point mutation into the female germline of experimental animals demonstrated selective elimination during oogenesis of the severe mutation and selective retention of the milder mutation, with the emergence of mitochondrial disease in offspring after multiple generations. Thus, oogenesis itself can act as an \u201cevolutionary\u201d filter for mtDNA disease."

In addition, each mitochondrion contains several copies of a small circular chromosome (Chap. 85e). The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is ~16.5 kb and encodes transfer and ribosomal RNAs and 13 core proteins that are components of the respiratory chain involved in oxidative phosphorylation and ATP generation. The mitochondrial genome does not recombine and is inherited through the maternal line because sperm does not contribute significant cytoplasmic components to the zygote. A noncoding region of the mitochondrial chromosome, referred to as D-loop, is highly polymorphic. This property, together with the absence of mtDNA recombination, makes it a valuable tool for studies tracing human migration and evolution, and it is also used for specific forensic applications."

The pace at which molecular clocks run during evolution is determined not only by the degree of purifying selection, but also by the mutation rate.

In the mitochondrion with the largest number of genes in Figure 14\u201360, that of the protozoan Reclinomonas, the genetic code is unchanged from the standard genetic code of the cell nucleus. Yet UGA, which is a stop codon elsewhere, is read as tryptophan in the mitochondria of mammals, fungi, and invertebrates. Similarly, the codon AGG normally codes for arginine, but it codes for stop in the mitochondria of mammals and codes for serine in the mitochondria of Drosophila (see Table 14\u20133).

Whatever the reason, aided by a massive accumulation of DNA segments derived from parasitic transposable elements (discussed in Chapter 5), the genomes of most eukaryotes have become orders of magnitude larger than those of bacteria and archaea (Figure 1\u201332).

As will be described in the overview of genetics in Chapter 8, SNPs in the human genome can be extremely useful for genetic mapping analyses, in which one attempts to associate specific traits (phenotypes) with specific DNA sequences for medical or scientific purposes (see p. 493). But while useful as genetic markers, there is good evidence that most of these SNPs have little or no effect on human fitness. This is as expected, since deleterious variants will have been selected against during human evolution and, unlike SNPs, should"

            "content": "It is possible to get direct sequence information by examining DNA samples from ancient materials if these are not too old. In recent years, technical advances have allowed DNA sequencing from exceptionally well-preserved bone fragments that date from more than 100,000 years ago. Although any DNA this old will be imperfectly preserved, a sequence of the Neanderthal genome has been reconstructed from many millions of short DNA sequences, revealing\u2014among other things\u2014that our human ancestors interbred with Neanderthals in Europe and"

            "content": "From detailed comparisons of the DNA sequences of a large number of modern humans located around the globe, scientists can estimate how many generations have elapsed since the origin of a particular neutral mutation. From such data, it has been possible to map the routes of ancient human migrations. For example, by combining this type of genetic analysis with archaeological findings, scientists have been able to deduce the most probable routes that our ancestors took when they left Africa 60,000 to 80,000 years ago (Figure 4\u201379)."
