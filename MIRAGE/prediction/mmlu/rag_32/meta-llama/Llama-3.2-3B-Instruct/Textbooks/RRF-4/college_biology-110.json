    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which source makes the greatest contribution to the dry mass of organic matter that comprises an oak tree, we need to consider the composition of an oak tree and how it obtains its organic matter. An oak tree is a plant, and like other plants, it relies on photosynthesis to produce its organic compounds. Photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil. The dry mass of an oak tree is primarily composed of cellulose, lignin, and other organic compounds produced during photosynthesis. Let's evaluate the options: A. Organic molecules from decaying matter in the soil that are taken up by the roots: This process is called saprotrophy, and it does contribute to the oak tree's nutrient uptake, but it is not the primary source of its organic matter. B. Mineral nutrients dissolved in groundwater that are taken up by the roots: While essential for the tree's growth, these nutrients are not organic matter. C. Water that is taken up by the roots and carbon dioxide from the air: This is the primary source of organic matter for the oak tree, as it undergoes photosynthesis to produce glucose and other organic compounds. D. Endosperm located in the cotyledons of the acorn: The endosperm is a storage tissue in seeds, and while it provides nutrients to the growing seedling, it is not a significant source of organic matter for the mature oak tree. Given this analysis, option C is the most likely source of the greatest contribution to the dry mass of organic matter that comprises an oak tree.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

This carboxylation reaction is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by a large enzyme called ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, or Rubisco for short. Because the reaction is so slow (each Rubisco molecule turns over only about 3 molecules of substrate per second, compared to 1000 molecules per second for a typical enzyme), an unusually large number of enzyme molecules are needed. Rubisco often constitutes more than 50% of the chloroplast protein mass, and it is thought to be the most abundant protein on Earth. In a global context, Rubisco also keeps the amount of the greenhouse gas CO2 in the atmosphere at a low level."

Compare the wilted leaf of a dehydrated plant, for example, with the turgid leaf of a well-watered one. It is the mechanical strength of the cell wall that allows plant cells to sustain this internal pressure."

In the absence of these gases, the earth\u2019s to a climate unfamiliar to our species, Homo sapiens. This new climate has already altered the epidemiology of some infectious diseases. average temperature would be about 33\u00b0C colder.

At each of three distinct steps along the way (marked by the three electron-transport complexes of the respiratory chain, see below), much of the energy is utilized for pumping protons across the membrane. At the end of the electron-transport chain, the electrons and protons recombine with molecular oxygen into water. Water is a very low-energy molecule and is thus very stable; it can serve as an electron donor only when a large amount of energy from an external source is spent on splitting it into protons, electrons, and molecular oxygen. This is exactly what happens in oxygenic photosynthesis, where the external energy source is the sun, as we shall see later in the section on chloroplasts (p. 782). the Energy Derived from Oxidation Is Stored as an Electrochemical Gradient"

            "content": "The present climate period, known as the Holocene, is remarkable for its stability: temperatures have largely remained within a range of 2\u20133\u00b0C. This stability has enabled the successful population and cultivation of much of the earth\u2019s landmass by humanity. Current climate change differs from that in the past not only because its primary cause is human activities but also because its pace is faster. The 5\u00b0C of warming that occurred at the end of the last ice age took roughly 5000 years, whereas such a temperature increment may occur within the next 150 years unless the release of greenhouse gases is substantially reduced in coming decades. The current rate of warming on Earth is remainder reaches Earth\u2019s surface, where it is absorbed and some is then emitted back at the atmosphere. The earth emits energy absorbed from the sun at longer wavelengths, primarily infrared, that greenhouse gases are able to absorb. The change in wavelength that occurs as solar radiation is absorbed and"

The reaction is irreversible, since the smoke and ashes never spontaneously retrieve these entities from the heated atmosphere and reconstitute themselves into paper. When the paper burns, its chemical energy is dissipated as heat\u2014not lost from the universe, since energy can never be created or destroyed, but irretrievably dispersed in the chaotic random thermal motions of molecules. At the same time, the atoms and molecules of the paper become dispersed and disordered. In the language of thermodynamics, there has been a loss of free energy; that is, of energy that can be harnessed to do work or drive chemical reactions. This loss reflects a reduction of orderliness in the way the energy and molecules were stored in the paper. We shall discuss free energy in more detail shortly, but the general"
