    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the physiological changes that occur during intense exercise, such as soccer, and how they affect blood lactate concentration. In intense exercise, the muscle uses carbohydrate-derived energy stores, leading to an increase in lactate production. As the game progresses and the players become more fatigued, the muscle's ability to utilize fatty acids for energy increases, but lactate production continues to rise. Therefore, we can expect the blood lactate concentration to increase throughout the course of the game as the players become more fatigued. This is supported by the fact that lactate levels are higher at the end of the game than at the end of the first half, as the body's energy stores are depleted and anaerobic metabolism becomes more prominent.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

As stated earlier, the circumstances during exercise are somewhat different. During a short period of intense exercise, the muscle uses carbohydrate derived from glycogen stores; myophosphorylase is the enzyme that initiates the metabolism of glycogen. With longer aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen stores, energy is provided by oxidation of fatty acids. Thus, muscle failure at a certain phase of exercise is predictive of the type of energy failure. A rising blood concentration of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate reflects the increasing oxidation of fatty acids, and an increase in blood lactate reflects the anaerobic metabolism of glucose. The cytochrome oxidative mechanisms are essential in both aerobic and anaerobic muscle"

For example, in the liver and heart, this ratio is lower than in exercising muscle. Consequently, the liver and heart oxidize lactate (obtained from the blood) to pyruvate. In the liver, pyruvate is either converted to glucose by gluconeogenesis or converted to acetyl CoA that is oxidized in the TCA cycle. Heart muscle exclusively oxidizes lactate to carbon dioxide and water via the TCA cycle. 3."

Lactate formation in muscle: In exercising skeletal muscle, NADH production (by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and by the three NAD+-linked dehydrogenases of the TCA cycle, see p. 113) exceeds the oxidative capacity of the ETC. This results in an elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio, favoring reduction of pyruvate to lactate by LDH. Therefore, during intense exercise, lactate accumulates in muscle, causing a drop in the intracellular pH, potentially resulting in cramps. Much of this lactate eventually diffuses into the bloodstream and can be used by the liver to make glucose (see p. 118). 2."

Through the citric acid cycle, alanine in conjunction with lactate, which is converted from pyruvate in the periphery in the presence of oxygen deprivation, enhances the hepatic production of glucose. With reduced availability of oxygen, the breakdown of glucose to pyruvate, and ultimately lactate, represents an inefficient cycling of substrate with minimal net energy production. An elevated plasma lactate/pyruvate ratio is preferable to lactate alone as a measure of anaerobic metabolism and reflects inadequate tissue perfusion. Decreased clearance of exogenous triglycerides coupled with increased hepatic lipogenesis causes a significant rise in serum triglyceride concentrations. There is increased protein catabolism as energy substrate, a negative nitrogen balance, and, if the process is prolonged, severe muscle wasting."

Leigh syndrome and MELAS particularly have a tendency to exhibit elevations of lactate; however, the diagnosis of either cannot be excluded in the presence of normal levels of this substance, even after provocation by exercise (see further on for a description of testing for elevated lactate). Using phosphorus MRI scans, one can compare levels of inorganic phosphate to phosphocreatine levels in muscle; in genetic muscle diseases of several types, this ratio increases, but it is highest in those of mitochondrial origin."

Cardiac utilization of lactate occurs in most circumstances; insulin does not affect its uptake by the myocardium.

WibergItzel and associates (2008) randomly assigned 1496 fetuses to scalp blood pH analysis and 1496 to scalp blood lactate analysis. They found either to be equivalent in predicting fetal acidemia.

Acute renal failure occurs in 55\u201370% of cases; however, renal function recovers in most of these cases (up to 70% in various series). Leukemoid reactions, with leukocyte counts of 50,000/ \u03bcL, are sometimes noted in association with HUS."
