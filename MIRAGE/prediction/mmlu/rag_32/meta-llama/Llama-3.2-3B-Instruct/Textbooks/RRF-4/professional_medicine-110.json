Kawasaki disease is a condition that can lead to coronary artery aneurysms if not treated promptly. The American Heart Association recommends intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as the first-line treatment for Kawasaki disease to prevent coronary artery aneurysms. The other options, such as intravenous penicillin, intravenous prednisone, and oral isoniazid, are not the appropriate treatments for Kawasaki disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"} Note: The other options, B, C, and D, are not the correct treatments for Kawasaki disease.

HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"
