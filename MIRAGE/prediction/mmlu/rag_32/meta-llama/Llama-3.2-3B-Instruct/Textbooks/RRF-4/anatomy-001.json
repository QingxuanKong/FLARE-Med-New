A dished face profile is a facial deformity characterized by a concave appearance of the lower part of the face, often due to a deficiency in the growth of the maxilla. Let's evaluate each option given:\\n\\nOption A: A protruding mandible due to reactivation of the condylar cartilage by acromegaly. This condition is more likely to cause a protruding jaw rather than a dished face profile.\\n\\nOption B: A recessive maxilla due to failure of elongation of the cranial base. This is a plausible cause of a dished face profile, as a recessive maxilla would result in a narrower and more concave facial structure.\\n\\nOption C: An enlarged frontal bone due to hydrocephaly. While hydrocephaly can cause a range of facial deformities, it is not typically associated with a dished face profile.\\n\\nOption D: Defective development of the maxillary air sinus. This condition may affect the shape of the facial bones, but it is not the most direct cause of a dished face profile.\\n\\nConsidering the options, the most likely cause of a dished face profile is a recessive maxilla due to failure of elongation of the cranial base (Option B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

In other words, the affect, which is the outward expression of feeling, is consistent with the depressed mood. During the interview, the patient may be tearful and may cry openly. In some, there is a kind of immobility of the face that mimics parkinsonism, though others are restless and agitated (pacing, wringing their hands, etc.). Occasionally the patient will smile, but the smile impresses one as more a social gesture than a genuine expression of feeling."

The notion that there is a \u201cface area\u201d in the fusiform gyrus is expressed uncritically in the literature and seems to be an oversimplification. A variant of this disorder is characterized by specific difficulty with facial matching or discrimination from partial cues, such as portions of the face or a profile. The distinction between this deficit and the usual type of prosopagnosia rests on the use of tests that do not require memory of a specific face. This difficulty with facial matching and discrimination is more likely to be seen with lesions of the right than of the left posterior hemisphere."

Caput succedaneum may be seen after prolonged labor in full-term and preterm infants.

A cephalhematoma is a subperiosteal hemorrhage that does not cross the suture lines surrounding the respective bones. A linear skull fracture rarely may be seen underlying a cephalhematoma.

Utilization of chromosome microarray analysis has made analysis of the origins of duplicated chromosome material straightforward (Fig. 83e-2). Recurrent syndromes associated with supernumerary chromosomes include the inverted duplication 15 (inv dup 15) syndrome, caused by the presence of a marker chromosome derived from chromosome 15, with two copies of proximal 15q resulting in tetrasomy (four copies) of this region. The inv dup 15 syndrome has a distinct phenotype and is associated with hypotonia, developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and autistic behavior. Another syndrome is the cat eye syndrome, named for the \u201ccat-eyelike\u201d"

Here, the smooth muscle nuclei appear as round profiles and the nuclei of the endothelial cells lining the lumen appear in longitudinal profile. In the segment numbered 3, the vessel wall is again only grazed. In the segment numbered 4, the cut is deeper, again showing the lumen and some of the endothelial cells in face view (arrowheads). The structure below the vessel is a Pacinian corpuscle (P)."

The specific personality features of individuals are always recorded in eval- uating Criterion'B, so the combination of personality features characterizing an individual directly constitutes the specifiers in each case. For example, two individuals who are both characterized by emotional lability, hostility, and depressivity may differ such that the first individual is characterized additionally by callousness, whereas the second is not."

The mucosa of the vagina consists of a stratified squamous epithelium (Ep) and an underlying fibrous connective tissue (CT) that often appears more cellular than other fibrous connective tissue. The boundary between the two is readily identified because of the conspicuous staining of the closely packed small cells of the basal layer (B) of the epithelium. Connective tissue papillae project into the underside of the epithelium, giving the epithelial\u2013 connective tissue junction an uneven appearance. The papillae may be cut obliquely or in cross section and thus may appear as connective tissue islands (arrows) within the lower portion of the epithelium. The epithelium is characteristically thick and although keratohyaline granules may be found in the Mucosa, vagina, human H&E \u00d7110."
