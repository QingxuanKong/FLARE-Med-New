Bile contains conjugated and degraded waste products that are returned to the intestine for disposal, as well as substances that bind to metabolites in the intestine to aid in absorption (Table 18.1). Bile is carried from the parenchyma of the liver by bile ducts that fuse to form the hepatic duct. The cystic duct then carries the bile into the gallbladder, where it is concentrated.

Arrows indicate regions where bile canaliculi are draining into canals of Hering. Note that the canal of Hering is partially lined by hepatocytes and partially by cholangiocytes. It drains into intrahepatic bile ductule surrounded by hepatocytes, in contrast to the interlobular bile duct, which is embedded in the connective tissue of the portal canal. The terminal branch of a portal vein (lower right) accompanied by a small bile ductule are evident.800. b. Electron micrograph showing an intrahepatic bile ductule. The ductule collects bile from the canals of Hering. It is close to the hepatocytes, but the actual connection between bile canaliculi and the intrahepatic ductule is not evident in this plane of section. The ductule is composed of cholangiocytes (CH) surrounded by a complete basal lamina (BL). The narrow space (asterisks) into which microvilli of hepatocytes"

Bile acid synthesis is cholesterol catabolism and occurs in the liver. Bile acids are secreted in bile and are stored in the gallbladder between meals and at night. Food in the duodenum induces the release of cholecystokinin, a potent stimulus for gallbladder contraction resulting in bile acid entry into the duodenum. Bile acids are primarily absorbed via an Na-dependent transport process that is located only in the ileum. A relatively small quantity of bile acids (~500 mg) is not absorbed in a 24-h period and is lost in stool. Fecal bile acid losses are matched by bile acid synthesis. The bile acid pool (the total amount of bile acids in the body) is ~4 g and is circulated twice during each meal or six to eight times in a 24-h period."

Large lipid droplets are emulsified (have their surface area increased) in the mouth through the act of chewing (mastication). B. The enzyme colipase facilitates the binding of bile salts to mixed micelles, maximizing the activity of pancreatic lipase. C. The peptide hormone secretin causes the gallbladder to contract and release bile. D. Patients with cystic fibrosis have difficulties with digestion because their pancreatic secretions are less able to reach the small intestine, the primary site of lipid digestion. E. Formation of triacylglycerol-rich chylomicrons is independent of protein synthesis in the intestinal mucosa."
