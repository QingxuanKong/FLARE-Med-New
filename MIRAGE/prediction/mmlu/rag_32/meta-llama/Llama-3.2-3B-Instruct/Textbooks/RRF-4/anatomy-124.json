    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. According to Document [0], the preganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic nervous system leave the central nervous system (CNS) in the third, seventh, ninth, and tenth cranial nerves as well as the second and third sacral nerves. This indicates that the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers are associated with cranial nerves III, VII, IX, X, and sacral nerves S2-S4. Additionally, Document [1] states that the parasympathetic part of the autonomic division of the PNS leaves cranial and sacral regions of the CNS in association with cranial nerves III, VII, IX, and X, and sacral nerves S2 to S4. Document [6] also mentions that in the sacral region, the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers form special visceral nerves (the pelvic splanchnic nerves) which originate from the anterior rami of S2 to S4 and enter pelvic extensions of the large prevertebral plexus. However, it does not explicitly state the spinal nerves associated with the sacral preganglionic parasympathetic fibers. From the provided information, we can conclude that the preganglionic parasympathetic axons leave the CNS primarily with cranial nerves and sacral nerves, but the specific spinal nerves associated with the sacral preganglionic parasympathetic fibers are not explicitly mentioned. However, Document [8] states that the preganglionic parasympathetic motor fibers are found in several of the cranial nerve nuclei of the brainstem and in the sacral spinal cord (S3-S4) gray matter. It also states that the preganglionic axons in a splanchnic nerve often travel to a prevertebral ganglion and synapse, or they may pass through the ganglion and an autonomic plexus and end in a more distant ganglion. Given the information in Document [8], it is clear that the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers do not leave the CNS with the thoracic or lumbar spinal nerves. Based on the information provided, the correct answer can be determined.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

These are thinly myelinated. The postganglionic neurons, located in ganglia outside the CNS, give rise to the postganglionic unmyelinated autonomic nerves that innervate organs and tissues throughout the body. Responses to sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation are frequently antagonistic (Table 454-1), reflecting highly coordinated interactions within the CNS; the resultant changes in parasympathetic and sympathetic activity provide more precise control of autonomic responses than could be achieved by the modulation of a single system."

Consistent with transmission in the ANS, the synapse between preganglionic and postganglionic neurons is an obligatory nicotinic synapse. That is, the synapse between preganglionic and postganglionic neurons is mediated via acetylcholine released from the nerve terminal and acting at nicotinic receptors localized on the postganglionic neuron, which in this case is an intrinsic neuron."

An important traditional classification of autonomic nerves is based on the primary transmitter molecules\u2014acetylcholine or norepinephrine\u2014released from their terminals and varicosities. A large number of peripheral ANS fibers synthesize and release acetylcholine; they are cholinergic fibers; that is, they work by releasing acetylcholine. As shown in Figure 6\u20131, these include all preganglionic efferent autonomic fibers and the somatic (nonautonomic) motor fibers to skeletal muscle as well. Thus, almost all efferent fibers leaving the CNS are cholinergic. In addition, most parasympathetic postganglionic and some sympathetic postganglionic fibers are cholinergic. A significant number of parasympathetic postganglionic neurons use nitric oxide or peptides as the primary transmitter or as cotransmitters."

Of course, ACh is also the chemical transmitter of nerve impulses to the skeletal muscle fibers. Parasympathetic postganglionic function is mediated by two distinct types of ACh receptors: nicotinic and muscarinic, so named by Dale because the choline-induced responses were similar either to those of nicotine or to those of the alkaloid, muscarine.

            "content": "Sympathetic innervation is supplied by cell bodies in the spinal cord and fibers that terminate in the prevertebral ganglia (celiac, superior, and inferior mesenteric ganglia); these are the preganglionic neurons. These nerve fibers synapse with postganglionic neurons in the ganglia, and the fibers leave the ganglia and reach the end organ along the major blood vessels and their branches. Rarely there is a synapse in the paravertebral (chain) ganglia, as seen with sympathetic innervation of other organ systems. Some vasoconstrictor sympathetic fibers directly innervate blood vessels of the GI tract, and other sympathetic fibers innervate glandular structures in the wall of the gut. The ANS, both parasympathetic and sympathetic, also carries the fibers of afferent (toward the central nervous system [CNS]) neurons; these are sensory in nature. The cell bodies for the vagal afferents are in the nodose"

The sympathetic outflow is shown on the right; the parasympathetic, on the left. The sympathetic (thoracolumbar) outflow leaves the CNS from the thoracic and upper lumbar segments (T1\u2013L2 or L3) of the spinal cord. These presynaptic fibers communicate with postsynaptic neurons in two locations, the paravertebral and prevertebral ganglia. Paravertebral ganglia are linked together and form two sympathetic trunks (yellow columns on each side of the spinal cord). Prevertebral ganglia are associated with the main branches of the abdominal aorta (yellow circles). Note the distribution of postsynaptic sympathetic nerve fibers to the viscera. The parasympathetic (craniosacral) outflow leaves the CNS from the gray matter of the brain stem within cranial nerves III, VII, IX, and X and the gray matter of sacral segments (S2\u2013S4) of the spinal cord and is distributed to the"

Peripheral sympathetic innervation at the level of origin of the preganglionic fiber Preganglionic sympathetic fibers may synapse with postganglionic motor neurons in ganglia associated with the sympathetic trunk, after which postganglionic fibers enter the same anterior ramus and are distributed with peripheral branches of the posterior and anterior rami of that spinal nerve (Fig. 1.43). The fibers innervate structures at the periphery of the body in regions supplied by the spinal nerve. The gray ramus communicans connects the sympathetic trunk or a ganglion to the anterior ramus and contains the postganglionic sympathetic fibers. It appears gray because postganglionic fibers are nonmyelinated. The gray ramus communicans is positioned medial to the white ramus communicans."

They enter the sympathetic chain through white rami communicantes, and ascend to the superior cervical ganglion where they synapse with postganglionic sympathetic fibers. The postganglionic fibers are distributed along the internal carotid artery and its branches. The postganglionic sympathetic fibers destined for the orbit travel with the ophthalmic artery. Once in the orbit the fibers are distributed to the eyeball either by: passing through the ciliary ganglion, without synapsing, and joining the short ciliary nerves, which pass from the ganglion to the eyeball; or passing through long ciliary nerves to reach the eyeball. In the eyeball postganglionic sympathetic fibers innervate the dilator pupillae muscle."
