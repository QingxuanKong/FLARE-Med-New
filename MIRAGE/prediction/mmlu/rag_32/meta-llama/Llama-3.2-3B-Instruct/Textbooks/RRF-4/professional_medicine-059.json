Congenital hernias, which make up the majority of pediatric hernias, can be considered a developmental defect rather than an acquired weakness. During the normal course of development, the testes descend from the intra-abdominal space into the scrotum in the third trimester.

From its attachment to the uterus, the round ligament of the uterus continues to the ovary as the ligament of the ovary that develops from the short proximal end of the gubernaculum. An inguinal hernia is the protrusion or passage of a peritoneal sac, with or without abdominal contents, through a weakened part of the abdominal wall in the groin. It occurs because the peritoneal sac enters the inguinal canal either: indirectly, through the deep inguinal ring, or directly, through the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. Inguinal hernias are therefore classified as either indirect or direct."

At birth, approximately 95% of infants have the testicle normally positioned in the scrotum.A distinction should be made between an undescended testicle and an ectopic testicle. An ectopic testis, by definition, is one that has passed through the external ring in the normal pathway and then has come to rest in an abnormal location over-lying either the rectus abdominis or external oblique muscle, or the soft tissue of the medial thigh, or behind the scrotum in the perineum. A congenitally absent testicle results from failure of normal development or an intrauterine accident leading to loss of blood supply to the developing testicle.Brunicardi_Ch39_p1705-p1758.indd 174412/02/19 11:27 AM 1745PEDIATRIC SURGERYCHAPTER 39Clinical Presentation.

Examination of the contralateral side affords the clinician the opportunity to compare the presence and extent of herniation between sides. This is especially useful in the case of a small hernia. In addition to inguinal hernia, a number of other diagnoses may be considered in the differential of a groin bulge (Table 37-5).While very difficult to ascertain, there are certain physi-cal examination maneuvers that can be performed to help distinguish direct vs. indirect inguinal hernias. The inguinal occlusion test entails the examiner blocking the internal ingui-nal ring with a finger as the patient is instructed to cough. A controlled impulse suggests an indirect hernia, while persistent herniation suggests a direct hernia. Transmission of the cough impulse to the tip of the finger implies an indirect hernia, while an impulse palpated on the dorsum of the finger implies a direct"

Transmission of the cough impulse to the tip of the finger implies an indirect hernia, while an impulse palpated on the dorsum of the finger implies a direct hernia. When results of physical examination are com-pared against operative findings, there is a probability some-what higher than chance (i.e., 50%) of correctly diagnosing the type of hernia.21,22External groin anatomy is difficult to assess in obese patients, making the physical diagnosis of inguinal hernia chal-lenging. A further challenge to the physical examination is the identification of a femoral hernia. Femoral hernias should be palpable below the inguinal ligament, lateral to the pubic tubercle. In obese patients, a femoral hernia may be missed or misdiagnosed as a hernia of the inguinal canal. In contrast, a prominent inguinal fat pad in a thin patient, otherwise known as a femoral pseudohernia, may prompt an erroneous diagnosis of femoral hernia.ImagingIn the case of an ambiguous"

            "content": "One of the potential problems with hernias is that bowel and fat may become stuck within the hernial sac. This can cause appreciable pain and bowel obstruction, necessitating urgent surgery. Another potential risk is strangulation of the hernia, in which the blood supply to the bowel is cut off at the neck of the hernial sac, rendering the bowel ischemic and susceptible to perforation (Fig. 4.51). The hernial sac of an indirect inguinal hernia enters the deep inguinal ring and passes through the inguinal canal. If the hernia is large enough, the hernial sac may emerge through the superficial inguinal ring. In men, such a hernia may extend into the scrotum (Fig. 4.52). The hernial sac of a direct inguinal hernia pushes forward through the posterior wall of the inguinal canal immediately posterior to the superficial inguinal ring. The hernia protrudes directly forward medial to the inferior epigastric vessels and through the superficial inguinal ring."
