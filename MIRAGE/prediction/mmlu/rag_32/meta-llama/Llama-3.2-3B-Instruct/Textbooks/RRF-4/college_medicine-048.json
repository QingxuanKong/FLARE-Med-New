Although hypoxemia prompts supplemental oxygen, excess oxygen can damage the pulmonary epithelium, retina, and other immature tissues. Despite this, advances in mechanical ventilation technology have improved neonatal survival rates. For example, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) prevents the collapse of unstable alveoli. This allows high inspired-oxygen concentrations to be reduced, thereby minimizing its toxicity. In an attempt to minimize the need for tracheal intubation and intermittent positive-pressure ventilation, CPAP has been studied in well-designed multicenter trials (Morley, 2008; SUPPORT Study Group, 2010b). An initial CPAP strategy with subsequent selective surfactant use is a beneficial alternative to immediate intubation and surfactant for many neonates of extremely early gestational age (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2014)."

            "content": "In uncomplicated cases, recovery begins to occur within 3 or 4 days. In affected infants, oxygen is required. Use of high concentrations of ventilator-administered oxygen for prolonged periods, however, is associated with two well-known complications: retrolental fibroplasia (also called retinopathy of prematurity) in the eyes; and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Fortunately, both complications are now significantly less common as a result of gentler ventilation techniques, antenatal glucocorticoid therapy, and prophylactic surfactant treatments. Hence they are described briefly:"

Clinical laboratory and imaging results supported the diagnosis of infant respiratory distress syndrome. Which of the following statements about this syndrome is true? A. It is unrelated to the baby\u2019s premature birth. B. It is a consequence of too few type II pneumocytes. C. The lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio in the amniotic fluid is likely to be high (>2). D. The concentration of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine in the amniotic fluid would be expected to be lower than that of a full-term baby. E. It is an easily treated disorder with low mortality. F. It is treated by administering surfactant to the mother just before she gives birth."

By contrast, as many as one-third of infants who weigh less than 2500 gm are born at term and are therefore under-grown rather than immature. These small-for-gestationalage (SGA) infants suffer from fetal growth restriction. Fetal growth restriction may result from fetal, maternal, or placental abnormalities, although in many cases the specific cause is unknown."
