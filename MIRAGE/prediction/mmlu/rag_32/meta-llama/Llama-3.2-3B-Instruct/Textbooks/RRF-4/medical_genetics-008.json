According to Document [1], women with PKU who eat an unrestricted diet have abnormally high blood phenylalanine levels, which can damage developing fetal organs, especially neural and cardiac tissues. Document [8] states that the risk to the offspring of women with untreated PKU is approximately 1 in 10,000. However, Document [1] also mentions that the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU can be as high as 90% if the mother's phenylalanine levels remain above the recommended range. Therefore, we can conclude that the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU is very high, but the exact percentage is not explicitly stated in the documents. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the correct answer is not A (1%), B (10%), or C (25%). The correct answer is D (Almost 100%), as the risk is indeed very high, but the exact percentage is not specified in the documents. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Usually, by 6 months of life, severe mental retardation becomes all too evident; less than 4% of untreated phenylketonuric children have intelligence quotients (IQs) greater than 60. About one-third of these children are never able to walk, and two-thirds cannot talk. Seizures, other neurologic abnormalities, decreased pigmentation of hair and skin, and eczema often accompany the mental retardation in untreated children. Hyperphenylalaninemia and the resultant mental retardation can be avoided by restricting phenylalanine intake early in life.

In patients with PKU, tyrosine cannot be synthesized from phenylalanine, and, therefore, it becomes an essential amino acid and must be supplied in the diet. Discontinuance of the phenylalanine-restricted diet in early childhood is associated with poor performance on IQ tests. Adult PKU patients show deterioration of IQ scores after discontinuation of the diet (Fig. 20.20). Therefore, lifelong restriction of dietary phenylalanine is recommended. [Note: Individuals with PKU are advised to avoid aspartame, an artificial sweetener that contains phenylalanine.] 5. Maternal phenylketonuria: If women with PKU who are not on a low-phenylalanine diet become pregnant, the offspring can be affected with maternal PKU syndrome. High blood phenylalanine in the mother has a teratogenic"

Reference is also made to certain other aminoacidurias, described in the first part of this chapter, which, like Hartnup disease, are associated with intermittent ataxia. Only passing comments are made about the other aminoacidurias, which are exceedingly rare or have only an uncertain effect on the nervous system. A detailed account of these disorders can be found in the monograph of Scriver and coworkers. The Phenylketonurias (Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency, PAH Mutation)"

A significant percentage ofpremature infants and a few full-term infants have transientelevations in phenylalanine. Short-term follow-up usuallyidentifies these infants promptly. A small percentage of infantsdiagnosed with PKU (\u22642% in the United States) have a defectin the synthesis or metabolism of tetrahydrobiopterin, thecofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase and for other enzymesinvolved in the intermediary metabolism of aromatic aminoacids. Such disorders in biopterin metabolism are diagnosedby measuring dihydrobiopterin reductase in erythrocytes andby analyzing biopterin metabolites in urine. This testing shouldbe carried out in all hyperphenylalaninemic infants."

            "content": "Some patients with increased concentrations of serum phenylalanine in the neonatal period are unresponsive to measures that lower phenylalanine. They are usually found to have a defect in biopterin metabolism. The defect is usually the result of a mutation in tetrahydrobiopterin or BH4. If this condition is unrecognized and not treated promptly, it leads to seizures of both myoclonic and, later, grand mal types, combined with a poor level of responsiveness and generalized hypotonia. Swallowing difficulty is another prominent symptom. Within a few months, developmental delay becomes prominent. Unlike in PKU, phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme levels are normal, but there is a lack of tetrahydrobiopterin, which is a cofactor of phenylalanine hydroxylase. Treatment consists of administration of tetrahydrobiopterin in a dosage of 7.5 mg/kg/d in combination with a low-phenylalanine diet. It is important to recognize this condition early in life by the measurement of urine pterins and to"

Preconceptional counseling and consultation with providers from experienced PKU centers is recommended."
