Contraction of the diaphragm forces the abdominal contents downward and forward.

In adults, the diaphragm can generate airway pressures of up to 150 to 200 cm H2O during maximal inspiratory effort. During quiet breathing (tidal breathing), the diaphragm moves approximately 1 cm; however, during deep-breathing maneuvers (vital capacity), the diaphragm can move as much as 10 cm.

However, they do contract vigorously during exercise, and when airway obstruction is significant, they actively pull up the rib cage. During normal breathing, they anchor the sternum and upper ribs. Because the upper airway must remain patent during inspiration, the pharyngeal wall muscles (genioglossus and arytenoid) are also considered muscles of inspiration. All the rib cage muscles are voluntary muscles that are supplied by intercostal arteries and veins and innervated by motor and sensory intercostal nerves."

At the end of inspiration, an \u201coff-switch\u201d event causes neuron firing to decrease markedly, at which point exhalation begins. At the start of exhalation (phase I of expiration), a paradoxical increase in inspiratory neuron firing slows the expiratory phase down by increasing inspiratory muscle tone and expiratory neuron firing.

Innervation of the external intercostal muscles originates from intercostal nerves that arise from the same level of the spinal cord (T1 and T2). Paralysis of these muscles has no significant effect on respiration because respiration is dependent primarily on the diaphragm. This is why individuals with injuries to the lower spinal cord can breathe on their own; it is only when the injury is above C3 that an individual is completely dependent on a ventilator."

The heart rate response to cessation of vagal stimulation is very quick because, as already noted, ACh released from the vagus nerves is rapidly hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase. This short latency enables the heart rate to vary rhythmically at the respiratory frequency. Conversely, the norepinephrine released periodically at the sympathetic endings is removed very slowly. Therefore, the rhythmic variations in sympathetic activity that accompany inspiration do not induce any appreciable oscillatory changes in heart rate. Thus respiratory sinus arrhythmia is brought about almost entirely by changes in vagal activity. In fact, respiratory sinus arrhythmia is exaggerated when vagal tone is enhanced."

Normal movements (or postures), however, are rarely, if ever, caused by the isolated contraction of an individual muscle. Rather, they reflect the coordinated activity of large groups of muscles. For example, elbow flexion involves an initial burst of activity in flexor muscles, such as the biceps, and in relaxation of extensor muscles, such as the triceps. This activity is then succeeded by a burst of activity of the triceps and then a second burst of activity in the biceps to stop the flexion movement at the desired position.

Second, because the muscle fibers of the flattened diaphragm are shorter than those of a more normally curved diaphragm, they are less capable of generating inspiratory pressures than normal.

However, pharyngeal collapse can occur when the ventilatory control system is overly sensitive to CO2, with resultant wide fluctuations in ventilation and ventilatory drive and in upper airway instability. Moreover, increasing levels of CO2 during sleep result in central nervous system arousal, causing the individual to move from a deeper to a lighter level of sleep or to awaken. A low arousal threshold (i.e., awaken to a low level of CO2 or ventilatory drive) can preempt the CO2-mediated process of pharyngeal muscle compensation and prevent airway stabilization. A high arousal threshold, conversely, may prevent appropriate termination of apneas, prolonging apnea duration and oxyhemoglobin desaturation severity. Finally, any"
