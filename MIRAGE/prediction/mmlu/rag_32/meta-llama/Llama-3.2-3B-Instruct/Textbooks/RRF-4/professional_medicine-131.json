    "question": "A 37-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital because of inadequate control of his glucose concentrations for the past 2 months. Despite his poor control, he demands that he be discharged. He reports that he has had a 3-month history of fatigue, irritability, and feelings of hopelessness. He says that he has been noncompliant with his diabetic regimen, adding, \"Sometimes I forget.\" He has been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them but admits that he is lonely. He did not get out of bed for 2 days, which prompted his wife to call an ambulance and have him admitted to the hospital. Prior to admission to the hospital, his only medication was insulin, although he often missed doses. He does not drink alcohol. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 36 kg/m2 . His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, he is tired and has a restricted affect. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Cognition is intact. His fasting serum glucose concentration is 120 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 37-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus who is admitted to the hospital due to inadequate control of his glucose concentrations. He is noncompliant with his diabetic regimen, and his fasting serum glucose concentration is 120 mg/dL. The patient demands to be discharged, but there is a concern for his safety and well-being. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, irritability, and feelings of hopelessness may be indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS), both of which are serious complications of diabetes. The patient's BMI is 36 kg/m2, indicating obesity, which can increase the risk of complications. The patient's refusal to adhere to his treatment plan and his history of noncompliance with his medication regimen raise concerns about his ability to manage his condition safely at home. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to seek a court order to appoint a legal guardian to make decisions on his behalf and ensure his safety and well-being.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" } ``` The reasoning behind this answer is as follows: * The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that he may be at risk for serious complications of diabetes, such as DKA or HHNS. * The patient's refusal to adhere to his treatment plan and his history of noncompliance with his medication regimen raise concerns about his ability to manage his condition safely at home. * Seeking a court order to appoint a legal guardian is the most appropriate next step to ensure the patient's safety and well-being. * Options A and B are not appropriate because they do not address the patient's safety and well-being, and may put him at risk for further complications. * Option C, neuropsychological testing, may be helpful in assessing the patient's cognitive function, but it is not the most pressing concern in this situation. * Option D is the most appropriate next step because it ensures that the patient's safety and well-being are prioritized, and a legal guardian can make decisions on his behalf to ensure his care.",

The physical examination reflects profound dehydration and hyperosmolality and reveals hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status. Notably absent are symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and the Kussmaul respirations characteristic of DKA. HHS is often precipitated by a serious, concurrent illness such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Sepsis, pneumonia, and other serious infections are frequent precipitants and should be sought.

Powers The goals of therapy for type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) are to (1) eliminate symptoms related to hyperglycemia, (2) reduce or eliminate the long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications of DM (Chap. 419), and (3) allow the patient to achieve as normal a lifestyle as possible. To reach these goals, the physician should identify a target level of glycemic control for each patient, provide the patient with the educational and pharmacologic resources necessary to reach this level, and monitor/treat DM-related complications. Symptoms of diabetes usually resolve when the plasma glucose is <11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), and thus most DM treatment focuses on achieving the second and third goals. This chapter first reviews the ongoing treatment of diabetes in the outpatient setting and then discusses the treatment of severe hyperglycemia, as well as the treatment of diabetes in hospitalized patients."

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

            "content": "Diabetes-related complications affect many organ systems and are responsible for the majority of morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Strikingly, in the United States, diabetes is the leading cause of new blindness in adults, renal failure, and nontraumatic lower extremity amputation. Diabetes-related complications usually do not appear until the second decade of hyperglycemia. Because type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) often has a long asymptomatic period of hyperglycemia before diagnosis, many individuals with type 2 DM have complications at the time of diagnosis. Fortunately, many of the diabetes-related complications can be prevented or delayed with early detection, aggressive glycemic control, and efforts to minimize the risks of complications."

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

            "content": "because autonomic and nervous system symptoms occur at a lower blood sugar level than in younger diabetics, although the metabolic reactions and neurologic injury effects are similar in the two age groups. The autonomic symptoms of hypoglycemia are often masked by beta blockers. Frail older adults are at even higher risk for serious hypoglycemia than are healthier, higher-functioning older adults. In older patients with type 2 diabetes, a history of severe hypoglycemic episodes is associated with higher mortality risk, more severe microvascular complications, and greater risk of dementia. Thus, patients with suspected or documented episodes of hypoglycemia, especially those who are frail or disabled, need more liberal glucose-control goals, careful education about hypoglycemia, and close follow-up by the health care provider, possibly in the presence of a caregiver. Chlorpropamide has a prolonged half-life, particularly in older adults, and should be avoided because it is associated"

            "content": "A 45-year-old man with diabetes mellitus visited his nurse because he had an ulcer on his foot that was not healing despite daily dressings. Diabetes can lead to vascular disease of large and medium arteries, narrowing the lumen and reducing blood supply to the extremities, thereby impairing healing. In addition, diabetes can also affect blood supply to nerves, which leads to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy results in reduced sensation, and therefore minor injuries can often go unnoticed. This patient has developed an ulcer on his heel, which is a pressure point and likely to be under repeated strain. The nurse examined the ulcer and found that the ulcer was looking infected with pus at the base of the ulcer and asked for a specialist orthopedic opinion, who requested an x-ray and an MRI. The MRI and x-ray both demonstrated infection invading into the calcaneus with destruction of the bone (Fig. 6.141A,B)."

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."
