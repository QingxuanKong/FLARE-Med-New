        "A": "Moderate sexual size dimorphism",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's analyze the given information and the options provided. The key detail in the question is that the species of small rodent eats seeds from only one species of pine, and it is unusual for them to have small litter sizes. We need to consider how these factors might be related to the characteristics listed in the options. First, let's examine the options: A. Moderate sexual size dimorphism: This refers to the difference in size between males and females of the same species. While this can be an adaptation to environmental pressures, it's not directly related to litter size. B. High parental investment: This refers to the amount of energy and resources invested in offspring by parents. Small litter sizes can be an indicator of high parental investment, as parents may be investing more energy in each individual offspring to ensure their survival. C. Precocial young: This refers to offspring that are relatively mature and mobile from birth, requiring little care from parents. Small litter sizes can be associated with precocial young, as parents may not need to invest as much energy in each offspring. D. Frequent extrapair matings: This refers to the practice of males mating with multiple females outside of their primary pair bond. Small litter sizes can be associated with frequent extrapair matings, as males may not be investing as much energy in each offspring. Given the unusual small litter size, we can infer that the parents may be investing more energy in each offspring, which is consistent with high parental investment (option B). This is because parents may be allocating more resources to ensure the survival of each individual, leading to smaller litter sizes. The fact that the rodents eat seeds from only one species of pine may also suggest that they have a specialized diet, which could be related to their reproductive strategy. However, without more information about the specific ecological context, it's difficult to rule out the other options entirely. Nevertheless, based on the available information, high parental investment (option B) is the most plausible explanation for the small litter size. Therefore, the answer is B. High parental investment.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",

Why, for example, do we grow to be so much larger than a mouse? Even within a species, size can vary greatly; a Great Dane, for instance, can weigh over 40 times more than a Chihuahua (Figure 21\u201357). Three variables define the size of an organ or organism: the number of cells, the size of the cells, and the quantity of extracellular material per cell. Size differences can arise from changes in any of these factors (Figure 21\u201358). If we compare a mouse with a human, for example, we find that the difference lies chiefly in the number of cells, there being roughly 3000 times more cells in a human, corresponding to a body that is roughly 3000 times more massive. Wild and cultivated species of food plants, on the other hand, often differ in body size chiefly because of differences of cell size."

General measures to reduce peridomestic and occupational human contact with rodents are advised and include rodent-proofing of buildings and food-waste stores and removal of potential rodent habitats (e.g., woodpiles and junk heaps). Flea control by insecticide treatment of wild rodents is an effective means of minimizing human contact with plague if an epizootic is identified in an area close to human habitation. Any attempt to reduce rodent numbers must be preceded by flea suppression to reduce the migration of infected fleas to human hosts. An oral F1-V subunit vaccine using raccoon poxvirus (RCN) as a vector protects prairie dogs against Y. pestis injections and is being investigated for efficacy in preventing disease in wild animals,"

            "content": "This chapter summarizes the major features of selected arthropod-borne and rodent-borne viruses. Numerous viruses of this category are transmitted in nature among animals without ever infecting humans. Other viruses incidentally infect humans, but only a proportion of these viruses induce human disease. In addition, certain viral agents are regularly introduced into human populations or spread among humans by certain arthropods (specifically, insects and ticks) or by chronically infected rodents. These zoonotic viruses are taxonomically diverse and therefore differ fundamentally from one another in terms of virion morphology, replication strategies, genomic organization, and genome sequence. While a virus\u2019s classification in a taxon is enlightening with regard to natural maintenance strategies, sensitivity to antiviral agents, and particular aspects of pathogenesis, the classification does not necessarily predict which clinical signs and symptoms (if any) the virus will cause in"

An extreme example (not shown) is the cigar-shaped bacterium Epulopiscium fishelsoni, which lives in the gut of a surgeonfish and can be up to 600 \u03bcm long. Much of this world of microscopic organisms is virtually unexplored. Traditional methods of bacteriology have given us an acquaintance with those species that can be isolated and cultured in the laboratory. But DNA sequence analysis of the populations of bacteria and archaea in samples from natural habitats\u2014such as soil or ocean water, or even the human mouth\u2014has opened our eyes to the fact that most species cannot be cultured by standard laboratory techniques. According to one estimate, at least 99% of prokaryotic species remain to be characterized. Detected only by their DNA, it has not yet been possible to grow the vast majority of them in laboratories."
