The raw material of evolution is the DNA sequence that already exists: there is no natural mechanism for making long stretches of new random sequence. In this sense, no gene is ever entirely new.

These living organisms appear extraordinarily diverse. What could be more different than a tiger and a piece of seaweed, or a bacterium and a tree? Yet our ancestors, knowing nothing of cells or DNA, saw that all these things had something in common. They called that something \u201clife,\u201d marveled at it, struggled to define it, and despaired of explaining what it was or how it worked in terms that relate to nonliving matter."

            "content": "when 100 individuals were tested by a DNA microarray analysis that detects the copy number of DNA sequences throughout the entire length of this chromosome, the indicated distributions of DNA additions (green bars) and DNA losses (red bars) were observed compared with an arbitrary human reference sequence. The shortest red and green bars represent a single occurrence among the 200 chromosomes examined, whereas the longer bars indicate that the addition or loss was correspondingly more frequent. The results show preferred regions where the variations occur, and these tend to be in or near regions that already contain blocks of segmental duplications. many of the changes include known genes.

A major challenge in human genetics is to recognize those relatively few variations that are functionally important"
