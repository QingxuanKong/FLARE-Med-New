The submandibular gland is located under the floor of the mouth, in the submandibular triangle of the neck. Given its location, it is more likely to be palpable intraorally, as it is situated close to the oral cavity. However, it can also be palpable extraorally, particularly in the neck region. The question asks for the most likely location of the palpable gland, so we need to weigh the likelihood of each option. Option A, being palpable intraorally, is a more specific and likely location due to the gland\\u2019s proximity to the oral cavity. Option B, being palpable extraorally, is also possible, but less specific. Option C, being palpable both intra- and extraorally, is unlikely, as the gland is primarily located under the floor of the mouth. Option D, being detectable only by radiographical examination, is unlikely, as a palpable gland is typically a physical examination finding. Based on this analysis, the most likely location of the palpable gland is intraorally, making option A the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Despite their relatively simple morphology, the salivary glands give rise to at least 30 histologically distinct tumors ( Table 15.1 ). A small number of these neoplasms account for more than 90% of tumors. Overall, salivary gland tumors are relatively uncommon and represent less than 2% of all human tumors. Approximately 65% to 80% arise within the parotid, 10% in the submandibular gland, and the remainder in the minor salivary glands, including the sublingual glands. Approximately 15% to 30% of tumors in the parotid glands are malignant. By contrast, approximately 40% of submandibular, 50% of minor salivary gland, and 70% to 90% of sublingual tumors are cancerous. Thus, the likelihood that a salivary gland tumor is malignant is inversely proportional, roughly, to the size of the gland."

            "content": "Bacterial sialadenitis is a common infection that most often involves the major salivary glands, particularly the submandibular glands. The most frequent pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans. Duct obstruction by stones (sialolithiasis) is a common antecedent to infection; it may also be induced by impacted food debris or by edema consequent to injury. Dehydration and decreased secretory function can also predispose to bacterial invasion. Systemic dehydration, with decreased salivary secretions, may predispose to suppurative bacterial parotitis in older adult patients following major thoracic or abdominal surgery. Such obstruction and bacterial invasion lead to nonspecific inflammation of the affected glands that may be largely interstitial or, when induced by staphylococci or other pyogens, may be associated with suppurative necrosis and abscess formation. Autoimmune sialadenitis, better known as Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, is discussed in Chapter 5."

            "content": "http://ebooksmedicine.net Inflammation of the salivary glands, referred to as sialadenitis, may be induced by trauma, viral or bacterial infection, or autoimmune disease. The most common form of viral sialadenitis is mumps, which may produce enlargement of all salivary glands but predominantly involves the parotids. Mumps produces interstitial inflammation marked by a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate. While mumps in children is most often a self-limited benign condition, in adults it can cause pancreatitis or orchitis; the latter sometimes causes sterility. The mucocele is the most common inflammatory lesion of the salivay glands and results from either blockage or rupture of a salivary gland duct, with consequent leakage of saliva into the surrounding connective tissue stroma. Mucocele occurs most often in toddlers, young adults, and older adults, and typically manifests as a fluctuant swelling of the lower lip that may change in size, particularly in association with meals ("

            "content": "Lymphadenopathy may be an incidental finding in patients being examined for various reasons, or it may be a presenting sign or symptom of the patient\u2019s illness. The physician must eventually decide whether the lymphadenopathy is a normal finding or one that requires further study, up to and including biopsy. Soft, flat, submandibular nodes (<1 cm) are often palpable in healthy children and young adults; healthy adults may have palpable inguinal nodes of up to 2 cm, which are considered normal. Further evaluation of these normal nodes is not warranted. In contrast, if the physician believes the node(s) to be abnormal, then pursuit of a more precise diagnosis is needed.
