Two central reactions in glycolysis (steps 6 and 7) convert the three-carbon sugar intermediate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (an aldehyde) into 3-phosphoglycerate (a carboxylic acid; see Panel 2\u20138, pp. 104\u2013105), thus oxidizing an aldehyde group to a carboxylic acid group. The overall reaction releases enough free energy to convert a molecule of ADP to ATP and to transfer two electrons (and a proton) from the aldehyde to NAD+ to form NADH, while still liberating enough heat to the environment to make the overall reaction energetically favorable (\u2206G\u00b0 for the overall reaction is \u201312.5 kJ/mole)."

Like most enzymes, these have names ending in ase\u2014such as isomerase and dehydrogenase\u2014to indicate the type of reaction they catalyze. Although no molecular oxygen is used in glycolysis, oxidation occurs, in that electrons are removed by NAD+ (producing NADH) from some of the carbons derived from the glucose molecule. The stepwise nature of the process releases the energy of oxidation in small packets, so that much of it can be stored in activated carrier molecules rather than all of it being released as heat (see Figure 2\u201345). Thus, some of the energy released by oxidation drives the direct synthesis of ATP molecules from ADP and Pi, and some remains with the electrons in the electron carrier NADH."

It occurs in the cytosol of most cells, including many anaerobic microorganisms. Glycolysis probably evolved early in the history of life, before photosynthetic organisms introduced oxygen into the atmosphere. During glycolysis, a glucose molecule with six carbon atoms is converted into two molecules of pyruvate, each of which contains three carbon atoms. For each glucose molecule, two molecules of ATP are hydrolyzed to provide energy to drive the early steps, but four molecules of ATP are produced in the later steps. At the end of glycolysis, there is consequently a net gain of two molecules of ATP for each glucose molecule broken down. Two molecules of the activated carrier NADH are also produced."

Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis in cells with mitochondria and an adequate supply of O2. This series of ten reactions is called aerobic glycolysis because O2 is required to reoxidize the NADH formed during the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Fig. 8.9B). Aerobic glycolysis sets the stage for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, a major fuel of the TCA cycle. Alternatively, pyruvate is reduced to lactate as NADH is oxidized to NAD+ (Fig. 8.9C).

Understandably, normal tissues with a greater glycolytic capacity because of the presence of glycogen (e.g., the liver and striated muscle) are more likely to survive hypoxia and decreased oxidative phosphorylation than tissues with limited glucose stores (e.g., the brain). Although it seems counterintuitive, rapidly proliferating normal cells and cancer cells rely on aerobic glycolysis to produce much of their energy, a phenomenon referred to as the Warburg effect. The reason for this is that although glycolysis yields less ATP per molecule of glucose burned than oxidative phosphorylation, metabolites generated by glycolysis and the TCA cycle serve as precursors for the synthesis of cellular constituents (e.g., proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids) that are needed for cell growth and division. Alterations in cellular metabolism are frequently seen in cancer cells, so they are discussed in more detail in Chapter 6."

The products of pyruvate decarboxylation are a molecule of CO2 (a waste product), a molecule of NADH, and acetyl CoA (see Panel 2\u20139). The fatty acids imported from the bloodstream are moved into mitochondria, where all of their oxidation takes place (Figure 2\u201355).

The most important of these regulated enzymes are those that catalyze reactions with highly negative \u2206G0: citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and the \u03b1ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Reducing equivalents needed for oxidative phosphorylation are generated by the PDHC and the TCA cycle, and both processes are upregulated in response to a decrease in the ATP/ADP ratio. V.

Hexokinases I\u2013III: In most tissues, glucose phosphorylation is catalyzed by one of these isozymes of hexokinase, which is one of three regulatory enzymes of glycolysis (along with phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase). They are inhibited by the reaction product glucose 6-phosphate, which accumulates when further metabolism of this hexose phosphate is reduced. Hexokinases I\u2013III have a low Michaelis constant (Km) and, therefore, a high affinity (see p. 59) for glucose. This permits the efficient phosphorylation and subsequent metabolism of glucose even when tissue concentrations of glucose are low (Fig. 8.13). However, because these isozymes have a low maximal velocity ([Vmax] see p. 57) for glucose, they do not sequester (trap) cellular phosphate in the form of phosphorylated glucose or phosphorylate more glucose than the cell can use. [Note: These isozymes have broad substrate specificity and are able to phosphorylate several hexoses in addition to glucose.] 2. Hexokinase IV: In"

            "content": "Fig. 8.25). Anaerobic glycolysis, in which lactic acid is the end product, occurs in cells that lack mitochondria and in cells deprived of sufficient O2. Glucose is passively transported across membranes by 1 of 14 glucose transporter (GLUT) isoforms. GLUT-1 is abundant in RBC and the brain, GLUT-4 (which is insulin dependent) in muscle and adipose tissue, and GLUT-2 in the liver, kidneys, and pancreatic \u03b2 cells. The oxidation of glucose to pyruvate (glycolysis, see Fig. 8.25) occurs through an energy-investment phase in which phosphorylated intermediates are synthesized at the expense of ATP and an energy-generation phase in which ATP is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation. In the energy-investment phase, glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase (found in most tissues) or glucokinase (a hexokinase found in liver cells and pancreatic \u03b2 cells). Hexokinase has a high affinity (low Km) and a low maximal velocity (Vmax) for glucose and is inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate."

            "content": "(A) Cells that are not proliferating will normally oxidize nearly all of the glucose that they import from the blood to produce ATP through the oxidative phosphorylation that takes place in their mitochondria. Only when deprived of oxygen will these cells generate most of their ATP from glycolysis, converting the pyruvate produced to lactate in order to regenerate the NAD+ that they need to keep glycolysis going (see Figure 2\u201347). (B) Tumor cells, by contrast, will generally produce abundant lactate even in the presence of oxygen. This results from a greatly increased rate of glycolysis that is fed by a very large increase in the rate of glucose import. In this way, tumor cells resemble the rapidly proliferating cells in embryos (and during tissue repair), which likewise require for biosynthesis a large supply of the small-molecule building blocks that can be produced from imported glucose (see also Figure 20\u201326)."

            "content": "The situation is further complicated in a multicellular organism. Different cell types will in general require somewhat different sets of enzymes. And different tissues make distinct contributions to the chemistry of the organism as a whole. In addition to differences in specialized products such as hormones or antibodies, there are significant differences in the \u201ccommon\u201d metabolic pathways among various types of cells in the same organism. Although virtually all cells contain the enzymes of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, lipid synthesis and breakdown, and amino acid metabolism, the levels of these processes required in different tissues are not the same. For example, nerve cells, which are probably the most fastidious cells in the body, maintain almost no reserves of glycogen or fatty acids and rely almost entirely on a constant Figure 2\u201362 The nine essential amino acids. These cannot be synthesized by human cells and so must be supplied in the diet."
