The spinal cord originates at the medulla and continues caudally to the conus medullaris at the lumbar level; its fibrous extension, the filum terminale, terminates at the coccyx. The spinal canal is formed by the vertebral arches of the vertebrae, which extend from the first cervical vertebra (CI) to the last sacral vertebra (vertebra SV). This bony canal contains the spinal cord and its protective membranes, together with blood vessels, connective tissue, fat, and proximal parts of spinal nerves. The vertebral canal is bordered anteriorly by the bodies of the vertebrae, intervertebral discs, and posterior longitudinal ligament, and posteriorly by the laminae and ligamenta flava. Therefore, the anatomic location of the spinal canal is posterior to the vertebrae, which corresponds to option B. dorsal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The first cervical nerve (C1) emerges from the vertebral canal between the skull and vertebra CI (Fig. 2.63). Therefore cervical nerves C2 to C7 also emerge from the vertebral canal above their respective vertebrae. Because there are only seven cervical vertebrae, C8 emerges between vertebrae CVII and TI. As a consequence, all remaining spinal nerves, beginning with T1, emerge from the vertebral canal below their respective vertebrae."

Spinal nerves originate from the spinal cord at increasingly oblique angles from vertebrae CI to Co, and the nerve roots pass in the vertebral canal for increasingly longer distances. Their spinal cord level of origin therefore becomes increasingly dissociated from their vertebral column level of exit. This is particularly evident for lumbar and sacral spinal nerves.

When the spinal canal is developmentally narrow in its anteroposterior dimension at one or several points, the space available for the spinal cord becomes insufficient. A small canal certainly makes an individual more subject to the compressive effects of spondylosis. The range acquired of narrowing of the canal that produces symptomatic cervical spondylosis is generally from 7 to 12 mm (normal canal diameter: 17 to 18 mm). Consequently, one must consider several additional mechanisms by which the cord might be damaged. The effects of the natural motions of the spinal cord during flexion and extension of the neck are probably important in this respect. Adams and Logue confirmed the observation of O\u2019Connell that, during full flexion and extension of the neck, the cervical cord and dura move up and down.

Later, following recognition of the central canal as a normal structure, it was assumed by Virchow (1863) and by Leyden (1876) that cavitation of the spinal cord had its origin in an abnormal expansion of the central canal, and they renamed the process hydromyelia. Cavities in the central portions of the spinal cord, unconnected with the central canal, were recognized by Hallopeau (1870); Simon suggested in 1875 that the term syringomyelia be reserved for such cavities and that the term hydromyelia be restricted to simple dilatation of the central canal. Thus, a century ago, the stage was set for an argument about pathogenesis that has not been settled to the present day."

In adults, the spinal cord terminates at a level approximately between vertebrae LI and LII, but this can range between vertebra TXII and the disc between vertebrae LII and LIII. Consequently, posterior and anterior roots forming spinal nerves emerging between vertebrae in the lower regions of the vertebral column are connected to the spinal cord at higher vertebral levels. Below the end of the spinal cord, the posterior and anterior roots of lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal nerves pass inferiorly to reach their exit points from the vertebral canal.

However, in the lumbar region, large gaps exist between the posterior components of adjacent vertebral arches (Fig. 2.23). These gaps between adjacent laminae and spinous processes become increasingly wide from vertebra LI to vertebra LV. The spaces can be widened further by flexion of the vertebral column. These gaps allow relatively easy access to the vertebral canal for clinical procedures.

In some instances removal of the lamina will increase the potential space and may relieve symptoms. Some surgeons perform a small fenestration (windowing) within the ligamentum flavum. This provides access to the canal. The meningeal sac and its contents are gently retracted, exposing the nerve root and the offending disc.

McCrae, who described the radiologic features of more than 100 patients with bony abnormalities at the craniocervical junction, found this partial or complete bony union of the atlas and occipital bone in 28 cases. He also noted that whenever the anteroposterior diameter of the canal behind the odontoid process was less than 19 mm, there were signs of spinal cord compression. Fusion of the second and third cervical vertebrae is a common associated anomaly but does not seem to be of clinical significance.

            "content": "Laterally, each denticulate ligament forms a series of triangular extensions along its free border, with the apex of each extension being anchored through the arachnoid mater to the dura mater. The lateral attachments of the denticulate ligaments generally occur between the exit points of adjacent posterior and anterior rootlets. The ligaments function to position the spinal cord in the center of the subarachnoid space. Arrangement of structures in the vertebral canal The vertebral canal is bordered: anteriorly by the bodies of the vertebrae, intervertebral discs, and posterior longitudinal ligament (Fig. 2.60); laterally, on each side by the pedicles and intervertebral foramina; and posteriorly by the laminae and ligamenta flava, and in the median plane the roots of the interspinous ligaments and vertebral spinous processes."

A second branch is the posterior spinal artery, which passes posteriorly around the medulla and then descends on the posterior surface of the spinal cord in the area of the attachment of the posterior roots\u2014there are two posterior spinal arteries, one on each side (although the posterior spinal arteries can originate directly from the vertebral arteries, they more commonly branch from the posterior inferior cerebellar arteries). A third branch joins with its companion from the other side to form the single anterior spinal artery, which then descends in the anterior median fissure of the spinal cord."

Cylindrical in shape, it occupies the vertebral canal of the vertebral column to the LI and LII vertebral level in an adult (eFig. 9.44). Numerous ascending and descending axonal tracts course through the spinal cord and connect with the brain to convey sensory (afferent) and motor (efferent) information for facilitation of movement, reflexes, sensory input, and feedback mechanisms."
