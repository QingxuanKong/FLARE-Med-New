He is receiving intravenous 5% dextrose and 0.45% saline with potassium. Twelve hours after the operation he develops circumoral numbness and paresthesias in his fingertips, and he becomes very anxious.

The symptoms of circumoral numbness, paresthesias in the fingertips, and anxiety are suggestive of hypocalcemia, which is a known complication of thyroid surgery. The dry neck dressing and no stridor suggest that the patient is not experiencing any significant airway obstruction. The warm extremities with brisk capillary refill time are also consistent with hypocalcemia. The most likely physical examination finding would be related to neuromuscular function affected by hypocalcemia. The Chvostek sign is a clinical sign that is indicative of hypocalcemia, which is caused by the tapping of the facial nerve, leading to facial muscle spasms. This is a sensitive indicator of hypocalcemia, especially in the early stages.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"} The final answer is B.",

Renal dysfunction of hypothermia manifests itself as a paradoxic polyuria and is related to an increased glomerular filtration rate, as peripheral vascular constriction creates central shunting of blood. This is potentially perplexing in patients who are undergoing resuscita-tion for hemodynamic instability because the brisk urine output provides a false sense of an adequate intravascular fluid volume.Induced peripheral hypothermia for hyperpyrexia due to infection (not to include neurologic or cardiac disease) is likely deleterious and does not appear to be beneficial.

Diarrhea occurs in 30% of patients and is associated either with elevated circulating concentrations of calcitonin or tumor-related secretion of serotonin and prostaglandins. Some patients may also experience flushing. In addition, ectopic ACTH production by MTC may cause Cushing\u2019s syndrome. The diagnosis of MTC relies on the demonstration of hypercalcitoninemia (>90 pg/mL in the basal state); stimulation tests using IV pentagastrin (0.5 mg/kg) and or calcium infusion (2 mg/kg) are rarely used now, reflecting improvements in the assay for calcitonin. Neck ultrasonography with fine-needle aspiration of the nodules can confirm the diagnosis. Radionucleotide thyroid scans may reveal MTC tumors as \u201ccold\u201d nodules. Radiography may reveal dense irregular calcification within the involved portions of the thyroid gland and in lymph nodes involved with metastases. Positron emission tomography (PET) may help to identify the MTC and metastases (Fig. 408-2)."

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

Some experts recommend surgery in young individuals, particularly when the goiter is very large. Careful control of thyrotoxicosis with antithyroid drugs, followed by potassium iodide (3 drops SSKI orally tid), is needed prior to surgery to avoid thyrotoxic crisis and to reduce the vascularity of the gland. The major complications of surgery\u2014bleeding, laryngeal edema, hypoparathyroidism, and damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves\u2014are unusual when the procedure is performed by highly experienced surgeons. Recurrence rates in the best series are <2%, but the rate of hypothyroidism is only slightly less than that following radioiodine treatment."

Suspicion of thyroid cancer often originates through physical examination of patients and a review of their history. Diagnosis is established by FNAB of the thyroid mass or lymph node. Once thyroid cancer is diagnosed on FNAB, a complete neck ultrasound is strongly recommended to evalu-ate the contralateral lobe and for lymph node metastases in the central and lateral neck compartments.

It is important to note that there is a wide variation of opinion among clinicians and pathologists with respect to the above definitions. Tumor infiltration and invasion, as well as tumor thrombus within the middle thyroid or jugular veins, may be apparent at operation.Surgical Treatment and Prognosis. Patients diagnosed by FNAB as having a follicular lesion should undergo thyroid lobectomy because at least 70% to 80% of these patients will have benign adenomas.

In patients with palpable or imaging-detected cervical nodes, symptoms and signs of distant disease or calcitonin levels >500 pg/mL, additional imaging to include a neck and chest CT and a triple-phase liver CT or contrast-enhanced MRI and an axial MRI/bone scan is recommended to assess for metastatic disease.
