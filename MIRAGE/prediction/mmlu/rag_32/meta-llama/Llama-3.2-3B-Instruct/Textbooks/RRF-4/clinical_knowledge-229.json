Such copy number variations (CNVs) are widespread in the human genome and most likely lead to genetic imbalances.

Thus, if we assume that our common ancestor had a genome of human size (about 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs), mice would have lost a total of about 45% of that genome from accumulated deletions during the past 80 million years, while humans would have lost about 25%. However, substantial sequence gains from many small chromosome duplications and from the multiplication of transposons have compensated for these deletions. As a result, our genome size is thought to be practically unchanged from that of the last common ancestor of humans and mice, while the mouse genome is smaller by only about 0.3 billion nucleotides."

Over long periods of time, this would result in a major \u201ccleansing\u201d from this fish genome of those DNA sequences whose loss could be tolerated. The result is an unusually compact genome, relatively free of junk and clutter, but retaining through purifying selection the vertebrate DNA sequences that are functionally important.

Depending on the organism, approximately one-third of the proteins encoded by a sequenced genome do not clearly resemble any protein that has been studied biochemically.

In general, the sequences of individual genes are much more tightly conserved than is overall genome structure.

The resulting genomic library consisted of tens of thousands of bacterial colonies, each containing a different human DNA insert. The nucleotide sequence of each insert was determined separately and the sequence of the entire genome was stitched together from the pieces. The most important advantage of cDNA clones, over genomic clones, is that they contain the uninterrupted coding sequence of a gene.

In fact, genome comparisons strongly suggest that both lineage-specific gene loss and horizontal gene transfer, in some cases between evolutionarily distant species, have been major factors of evolution, at least among prokaryotes.

BAC clones: Most plant and animal genomes are large (often over 109 nucleotide pairs) and contain extensive amounts of repetitive DNA spread throughout the genome. Because a nucleotide sequence of a fragment of repetitive DNA will \u201coverlap\u201d every instance of the repeated DNA, it is diffcult, if not impossible, to assemble the fragments into a unique order solely by the shotgun method. To circumvent this problem, the human genome was frst broken down into very large DNA fragments (each approximately 100,000 nucleotide pairs) and cloned into BACs (see p. 469). The order of the BACs along a chromosome was determined by comparing the pattern of restriction enzyme cleavage sites in a given BAC clone with that of the whole genome. In this way, a given BAC clone can be mapped, say, to the left arm of human Chromosome 3. Once a collection of BAC clones was Thousands of genomes from individual humans have now been sequenced and it is not necessary to painstakingly"

            "content": "The size range of mitochondrial DNAs is similar to that of viral DNAs. The mitochondrial DNA in Plasmodium falciparum (the human malaria parasite) has less than 6000 nucleotide pairs, whereas the mitochondrial DNAs of some land plants contain more than 300,000 nucleotide pairs (Figure 14\u201366). In animals, the mitochondrial genome is a simple DNA circle of about 16,600 nucleotide pairs (less than 0.001% of the nuclear genome), and it is nearly the same size in organisms as different from us as Drosophila and sea urchins. The human mitochondrial genome has several surprising features that distinguish it from nuclear, chloroplast, and bacterial genomes: 1."

A gene is often defined as a segment of DNA that contains the instructions for making a particular protein (or a set of closely related proteins), but this definition is too narrow. Genes that code for protein are indeed the majority, and most of the genes with clear-cut mutant phenotypes fall under this heading. In addition, however, there are many \u201cRNA genes\u201d\u2014segments of DNA that generate a functionally significant RNA molecule, instead of a protein, as their final product. We shall say more about the RNA genes and their products later."

On average, any two people taken at random differ in about one or two in every 1000 nucleotide pairs in their DNA sequence. The genome of the human species is, properly speaking, a very complex thing, embracing the entire pool of variant genes found in the human population. Knowledge of this variation is helping us to understand, for example, why some people are prone to one disease, others to another; why some respond well to a drug, others badly. It is also providing clues to our history\u2014the population movements and minglings of our ancestors, the infections they suffered, the diets they ate. All these things have left traces in the variant forms of genes that survive today in the human communities that populate the globe.
