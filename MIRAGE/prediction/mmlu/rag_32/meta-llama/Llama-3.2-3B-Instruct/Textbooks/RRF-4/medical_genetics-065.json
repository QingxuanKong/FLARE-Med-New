According to Document [1] (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco), tandem repeats are short sequences of DNA at scattered locations in the genome, repeated in tandem (one after another). These variations can be used as molecular 'fingerprints' and are useful for DNA fingerprint analysis, such as in forensic and paternity cases. Document [2] (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco) also mentions that tandem repeats are useful for DNA fingerprinting and can be used to identify individuals. Furthermore, Document [5] (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco) states that DNA fingerprinting by means of PCR has revolutionized the analysis of evidence from crime scenes, and DNA isolated from a single human hair, a tiny spot of blood, or a sample of semen is sufficient to determine whether the sample comes from a specific individual.

The shortest red and green bars represent a single occurrence among the 200 chromosomes examined, whereas the longer bars indicate that the addition or loss was correspondingly more frequent. The results show preferred regions where the variations occur, and these tend to be in or near regions that already contain blocks of segmental duplications. many of the changes include known genes.

A major challenge in human genetics is to recognize those relatively few variations that are functionally important"

Telomeres Telomeres are complexes of DNA plus proteins (collectively known as shelterin) located at the ends of linear chromosomes. They maintain the structural integrity of the chromosome, preventing attack by nucleases, and allow repair systems to distinguish a true end from a break in dsDNA. In humans, telomeric DNA consists of several thousand tandem repeats of a noncoding hexameric sequence, AGGGTT, base-paired to a complementary region containing C and A. The G-rich strand is longer than its C-rich complement, leaving ssDNA a few hundred nucleotides in length at the 3\u2032end. The single-stranded region is thought to fold back on itself, forming a loop structure that is stabilized by protein. 1."

            "content": "The two most common forms of DNA variation in the human genome are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs). SNPs are variants at single nucleotide positions and are almost always biallelic (only two choices exist at a given site within the population, such as A or T). More than 6 million human SNPs have been identified, with many showing wide variation in frequency in different populations. The following features are worthy of note: SNPs occur across the genome\u2014within exons, introns, intergenic regions, and coding regions. Roughly 1% of SNPs occur in coding regions, which is about what would be expected by chance, because coding regions comprise about 1.5% of the genome. SNPs located in noncoding regions can occur in regulatory elements in the genome, thereby altering gene expression; in such instances the SNP may have a direct influence on disease susceptibility."
