Limited mucosal necrosis above the fascia may be treated expectantly, but necrosis below the level of the fascia requires surgical revision. Stoma retraction may occur early or late and may be exacerbated by obesity. Local revision may be necessary. The creation of an ileostomy bypasses the fluid-absorbing capability of the colon, and dehydration with fluid and electrolyte abnormalities is not uncommon. Ideally, ileos-tomy output should be maintained at less than 1500 mL/d to avoid this problem. Bulk agents and opioids (Lomotil, Imodium, tincture of opium) are useful.

Successful applications of alternative therapies to close intestinal fistulas such as the use of biologic sealants have been reported. The indications for their use remain to be defined.OutcomesOver 50% of intestinal fistulas close spontaneously. A useful mnemonic designates factors that inhibit spontaneous closure of intestinal fistulas: \u201cFRIEND\u201d (Foreign body within the fistula tract, Radiation enteritis, Infection/Inflammation at the fistula origin, Epithelialization of the fistula tract, Neoplasm at the fis-tula origin, Distal obstruction of the intestine).In a 23-year old retrospective review of 153 cases of enterocutaneous fistulas that were treated surgically, most fis-tulas were found to originate from the small bowel and be iat-rogenic in nature, with"

Infectious granulomas arising from a variety of organisms account for 70% to 80% of this type of benign solitary nodules; hamartomas are the next most common single cause, accounting for about 10%.CT findings characteristic of malignancy include growth over time; increasing density on CT scan (40% to 50% of partial solid lesions are malignant compared to only 15% of subcenti-meter solid or nonsolid nodules); size >3 cm; irregular, lobu-lated, or spiculated edges; and the finding of the corona radiata sign (consisting of fine linear strands extending 4 to 5 mm out-ward and appearing spiculated on radiographs) (Fig. 19-15). Calcification that is stippled, amorphous, or eccentric is usually associated with cancer.Growth over time is an important characteristic for differentiating benign and malignant lesions. Lung cancers have volume-doubling times from 20 to 400 days; lesions with shorter"

The loss of enteric luminal contents, particularly from high-output fistulas originat-ing from the proximal small intestine, results in dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and malnutrition.Fistulas have the potential to close spontaneously. Factors inhibiting spontaneous closure, however, include malnutrition, sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, radiation, obstruc-tion of the intestine distal to the origin of the fistula, foreign bodies, high output, short fistulous tract (<2 cm) and epitheli-alization of the fistula tract (Table 28-9).Clinical PresentationIatrogenic enterocutaneous fistulas usually become clinically evident between the fifth and tenth postoperative days. Fever, leukocytosis, prolonged ileus, abdominal tenderness, and wound infection are the initial signs. The diagnosis becomes obvious when drainage of enteric material through the abdominal wound or through existing drains occurs. These fistulas are often"

Because the timing of adjuvant chemotherapy effects survival, cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemother-apy usually should defer ileostomy closure until completion of treatment.Permanent Ileostomy A permanent ileostomy is sometimes required after total proctocolectomy or in patients with obstruc-tion. An end ileostomy is the preferred configuration for a per-manent ileostomy because a symmetric protruding nipple can be fashioned more easily than with a loop ileostomy (see Fig. 29-16). The end of the small intestine is brought through the abdominal wall defect and matured. Stitches are often used to secure the bowel to the posterior fascia.Complications of Ileostomy Stoma necrosis may occur in the early postoperative period and is usually caused by skel-etonizing the distal small bowel and/or creating an overly tight fascial defect."
