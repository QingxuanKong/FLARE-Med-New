These fibers are fast-twitch, fatigue-prone motor units and generate high peak muscle tension. Their myosin ATPase velocity is the fastest of all the fiber types. They also fatigue rapidly as a result of production of lactic acid. Thus, type IIb fibers are adapted for rapid contraction and precise, fine movements. They constitute most fibers of the extraocular muscles and the muscles that control the movements of the digits.

Their high levels of mitochondrial oxidative enzymes are demonstrated by their strong succinic dehydrogenase and NADH-TR histochemical staining reactions as described previously (see Fig. 11.3). Type I fibers are slow-twitch, fatigue-resistant motor units (a twitch is a single, brief contraction of the muscle). These fibers have great resistance to fatigue but generate less tension than other fibers. Their myosin ATPase reaction velocity is the slowest of all of the fiber types. Type I fibers are typically found in the limb muscles of mammals and in the breast muscle of migrating birds. More importantly, they are the principal fibers of the long muscles of the back in humans, where they are particularly adapted to the long, slow contraction needed to maintain erect posture.

Before innervation, the muscle fibers physiologically resemble slow (type I) cells. Acetylcholine receptors are distributed throughout the sarcolemma of these uninnervated cells and are supersensitive to that neurotransmitter. An end plate is formed when the first growing nerve terminal establishes contact with a muscle cell. The cell forms no further association with nerves, and receptors to acetylcholine become concentrated in the end plate membranes. Cells innervated by a small motor neuron form slow (type I) oxidative motor units. Fibers innervated by large motor nerves develop all the characteristics of fast (type II) motor units. Innervation produces major cellular changes, including synthesis of the fast and slow myosin isoforms, which replace embryonic or neonatal variants. Thus muscle fiber type is determined by the nerves that innervate the fiber."

The contractile speed determines how fast the fiber can contract and relax. Velocity of the myosin ATPase reaction determines the rate at which this enzyme is capable of breaking down ATP molecules during the contraction cycle. The metabolic profile indicates the capacity for ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation or glycolysis. Fibers characterized by oxidative metabolism contain large amounts of myoglobin and an increased number of mitochondria, with their constituent cytochrome electron transport complexes. Myoglobin is an oxygen-binding protein that closely resembles hemoglobin found in erythrocytes and occurs in varying amounts in muscle fibers.

It is clear that group Ia and group II fibers respond differently to stretch. Group Ia fibers are sensitive both to the amount of muscle stretch and to its rate, whereas group II fibers respond chiefly to the amount of stretch. Thus when a muscle is stretched to a new longer length, group II firing increases in proportion to the amount of stretch (see Fig. 9.3 , left), and when the muscle is allowed to shorten, its firing rate decreases proportionately (see Fig. 9.3 , right). Group Ia fibers show this same static-type response, and thus under steady-state conditions (i.e., constant muscle length), their firing rate reflects the amount of muscle stretch, similar to that of group II fibers."

            "content": "1. Fibril-forming collagens: Types I, II, and III are the fibrillar collagens and have the rope-like structure described above for a typical collagen molecule. In the electron microscope, these linear polymers of fibrils have characteristic banding patterns, reflecting the regular staggered packing of the individual collagen molecules in the fibril (Fig. 4.3). Type I collagen fibers (composed of collagen fibrils) are found in supporting elements of high tensile strength (for example, tendons and corneas), whereas fibers formed from type II collagen molecules are restricted to cartilaginous structures. The fibers derived from type III collagen are prevalent in more distensible tissues such as blood vessels. 2. Network-forming collagens: Types IV and VIII form a three-dimensional mesh, rather than distinct fibrils (Fig. 4.4). For example, type IV molecules assemble into a sheet or meshwork that constitutes a major part of basement membranes."

            "content": "The fibers formed by the three fibrillar collagens differ in thickness and length, but they have a similar fine structure. As viewed by electron microscopy, they all have a characteristic pattern of cross-striations that are about one-quarter the length of the monomers and reflect the precise packing into fibrils. The three fibrillar collagens, however, differ in sequences found in the Xand Y-positions of the \u03b1 chains and therefore in some of their physical properties. Type I collagen is composed of two identical \u03b11(I) chains and a third \u03b12(I) chain that differs slightly in its amino acid sequence. Type II collagen is composed of three identical \u03b1(II) chains. Type III collagen is composed of three identical \u03b11(III) chains."

            "content": "4. The force of contraction can be increased by the activation of more motor neurons (i.e., recruiting of more muscle fibers) or by an increase in the frequency of action potentials in the muscle fiber, which produces tetany. The increase in force during tetanic contractions is due to prolonged elevation of intracellular [Ca++]. 5. The two basic types of skeletal muscle fibers are distinguished on the basis of their speed of contraction (i.e., fast-twitch versus slow-twitch). The difference in speed of contraction is attributed to the expression of different myosin isoforms that differ in myosin ATPase activity. In addition to the difference in myosin ATPase activity, fast-and slow-twitch muscles also differ in metabolic activity, fiber diameter, motor unit size, sensitivity to tetany, and recruitment pattern. 6."
