    "predict": "To determine the expected frequency of affected females, we need to consider the fact that X-linked recessive disorders are more likely to affect males due to their single X chromosome. Since the frequency of males affected with the condition is 0.10, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg principle to estimate the frequency of affected females. According to the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the frequency of heterozygous females (i.e., females who are carriers of the mutated gene) is 2pq, where p is the frequency of affected males (0.10) and q is the frequency of unaffected males (1 - 0.10 = 0.90). Since each heterozygous female has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each of her sons, the frequency of affected sons is 2pq = 2(0.10)(0.90) = 0.18. Since each daughter inherits one X chromosome from her mother, she will not inherit the mutated gene from her mother, so the frequency of affected daughters is 0. However, each heterozygous female has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each of her daughters, so the frequency of carrier females is 2pq = 2(0.10)(0.90) = 0.18. Therefore, the expected frequency of affected females is 0, since none of the daughters inherit the mutated gene from their mothers. However, the question asks for the frequency of affected females, not carrier females. To calculate this, we need to use the Hardy-Weinberg principle for the frequency of affected females: The frequency of affected females is equal to the frequency of heterozygous females multiplied by the probability of expressing the disease, which is 0.5 for X-linked recessive disorders. So, the expected frequency of affected females is 0.18 x 0.5 = 0.09. However, since the question is asking for the frequency of affected females, not carrier females, we need to consider the frequency of affected males and females in the population. Since the frequency of affected males is 0.10, and assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of carrier females is 0.18. Since each carrier female has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each of her sons, the frequency of affected sons is 0.10. Since each daughter inherits one X chromosome from her mother, she will not inherit the mutated gene from her mother, so the frequency of affected daughters is 0. However, each carrier female has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each of her daughters, so the frequency of carrier females is 0.18. Since the frequency of affected males is 0.10, and each carrier female has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each of her sons, the frequency of affected females is 0.10 x 0.5 = 0.05. However, this is the frequency of females who have a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to their sons. Since carrier females have a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to their daughters as well, we need to add the frequency of affected females to the frequency of carrier females. The frequency of carrier females is 0.18. Since each carrier female has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each of her daughters, the frequency of affected daughters is 0.09. Therefore, the total frequency of affected females is 0.05 + 0.09 = 0.14. However, we need to consider the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequency of carrier females is 0.18, and the frequency of affected daughters is 0.09. Since each carrier female has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each of her daughters, the frequency of affected daughters is 0.09. However, the frequency of carrier females is 0.18, and the frequency of affected daughters is 0.09. Since each carrier female has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each of her daughters, the frequency of affected daughters is 0.09. Since the frequency of carrier females is 0.18, and the frequency of affected daughters is 0.09, the frequency of affected females is 0.09. Therefore, the expected frequency of affected females is 0.09. The final answer is {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the expected frequency of affected females, we need to consider the fact that X-linked recessive disorders are more likely to affect males due to their single X chromosome.

Thus, the characteristic features of X-linked inheritance are (1) the absence of father-to-son transmission, and (2) the fact that all daughters of an affected male are obligate carriers of the mutant allele (Fig. 82-13C). The risk of developing disease due to a mutant X-chromosomal gene differs in the two sexes. Because males have only one X chromosome, they are hemizygous for the mutant allele; thus, they are more likely to develop the mutant phenotype, regardless of whether the mutation is dominant or recessive. A female may be either heterozygous or homozygous for the mutant allele, which may be dominant or recessive.

In the latter case, sex-linked inheritance becomes difficult to distinguish from dominant inheritance. Also, sex linkage is deceptive when a disease is lethal to one sex.

Most X-linked diseases are recessive. Common examples include color blindness, hemophilia A and B, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. Males with an X-linked recessive gene are usually afected by the disease it causes, because they lack a second X chromosome to express the normal dominant gene. A male with an X-linked disease cannot have afected sons because they cannot receive his X chromosome. When a woman carries a gene causing an X-linked recessive condition, each of her sons has a 50-percent risk of being afected, and each daughter has a 50-percent chance of being a carrier."

When alleles at a given locus are identical, the individual is homozygous. Inheriting identical copies of a mutant allele occurs in many autosomal recessive disorders, particularly in circumstances of consanguinity or isolated populations. If the alleles are different on the maternal and the paternal copy of the gene, the individual is heterozygous at this locus (Fig. 82-10).

As noted before, new germline mutations occur more frequently in fathers of advanced age.

Patients with splice variants, exon skipping, or missense mutations of \u03b1-helical glycines generally deteriorate after the age of 30 (adult form) with mild or late deafness. Early severe deafness, lenticonus, or proteinuria suggests a poorer prognosis. Usually females from X-linked pedigrees have only microhematuria, but up to 25% of carrier females have been reported to have more severe renal manifestations. Pedigrees with the autosomal recessive form of the disease have severe early disease in both females and males with asymptomatic parents."

Most important, the initial presumption that all of the genes on the inactive X are \u201cswitched off\u201d has been revised, as roughly 21% of genes on Xp, and a smaller number (3%) on Xq, escape X inactivation. This observation has implications for monosomic X chromosome disorders, or Turner syndrome, as discussed later. Extra Y chromosomes are readily tolerated because the only information known to be carried on the Y chromosome seems to relate to male differentiation. Of note, whatever the number of X chromosomes, the presence of a Y invariably dictates the male phenotype. The gene for male differentiation (SRY, sex-determining region of Y chromosome) is located on the short arm of the Y. Described briefly next are two disorders, Klinefelter syndrome and Turner syndrome, that result from aberrations of sex chromosomes."

Answers to questions about the family help determine if there is an autosomal dominant, AR, X-linked, or sporadic disorder. When a child is affected with the new onset of an AD disorder, it is necessary to closely examine the parents to check for the presence of manifestations. If the parents are unaffected, the child\u2019s condition is most likely the result of a new mutation; the risk of recurrence is extremely low (although not 0, because of the possibility of gonadal mosaicism in one of the parents). When one parent is affected (even mildly so due to varying penetrance), the recurrence risk rises to 50%. With X-linked disorders, the focus is on the maternal family history to determine if there is a significant enough risk to warrant testing."

Indeed, phenotypically normal males with two and even three Y chromosomes have been identified. Such extreme karyotypic deviations are not encountered with the autosomes. In large part, this latitude relates to two factors: lyonization of X chromosomes and the small amount of genetic information carried by the Y chromosome. The consideration of lyonization must begin with Mary Lyon, who in 1962 proposed that in females, only one X chromosome is genetically active. X inactivation occurs early in fetal life, about 16 days after conception. Either the paternal or the maternal X chromosome is randomly inactivated in each cell of the developing embryo. Once inactivated, the same X chromosome remains inactive in all of the progeny of these cells. Moreover, all but one X chromosome is inactivated, and so a 48,XXXX female has only one active X chromosome. This phenomenon"

            "content": "Traditionally, the recognition of the broad categories of genetically determined diseases has rested on their pattern of occurrence in families, segregated according to mendelian inheritance into autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and sex-linked types. As mentioned, mutations of nuclear DNA account for the heritable autosomal and sex-linked diseases described in this chapter, and they are remarkably diverse in nature. Some are lethal and are therefore not transmitted to successive generations; others are less harmful and may conform to one of the classic mendelian patterns. The mutation may be large and result in duplication of a major part of a chromosome or even of the entire gene (diploidy or triploidy) or a deletion (haploidy). Other mutations are quite small, involving only a single base pair (\u201cpoint mutation\u201d). Between these two extremes are deletions or duplications that include a portion of a gene, an entire gene, or contiguous genes, as mentioned above."

Disorders of Autosomal Dominant Inheritance Disorders of autosomal dominant inheritance are manifested in the heterozygous state, so at least one parent in an index case usually is affected. Both males and females can be affected, and both sexes can transmit the condition. When an affected person marries an unaffected one, each child has one chance in two of having the disease. The following features also pertain to autosomal dominant diseases: With any autosomal dominant disorder, some patients do not have affected parents. Such patients owe their disorder to new mutations involving either the egg or the sperm from which they were derived. Their siblings are neither affected nor at increased risk for development of the disease."

Variable degrees of penetrance and expressivity are characteristic features of dominant patterns of inheritance but not of recessive ones. There is also a general tendency for dominantly inherited disease to first appear long after birth."
