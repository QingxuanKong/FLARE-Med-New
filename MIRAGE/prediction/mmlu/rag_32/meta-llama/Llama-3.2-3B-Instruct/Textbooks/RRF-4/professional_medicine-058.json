    "question": "A 35-year-old man with spina bifida is admitted to the hospital for a urologic procedure. He has been functionally independent in activities of daily living and is employed doing inventory control in a local sporting goods store. He has maintained continence through periodic self-catheterization. The patient is paraplegic, has recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stones, and recent onset of incontinence secondary to detrusor and bladder neck dysfunction. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows a well-developed, well-nourished man in no acute distress. Aside from paraplegia, lower extremity muscle atrophy, and lower abdominal surgical scars, the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. He had an episode of anaphylaxis secondary to latex allergy during a previous operation for functional expansion of his bladder through a bowel anastomosis. Which of the following is most important to consider in the care of this patient?",

The correct answer can be deduced by analyzing the potential risks associated with each option.\\n\\nOption A, administration of injectable medications with disposable syringes, is a good practice in general, but it does not directly address the latex allergy.\\n\\nOption B, preparation of food by outside contractors, may help prevent cross-contamination of food with latex, but it is not the most critical consideration in this patient's care.\\n\\nOption C, type of cleaning agents used to sterilize bed linens, is a crucial factor in preventing the spread of latex particles and reducing the risk of anaphylaxis. Many cleaning agents, such as bleach or quaternary ammonium compounds, can release latex particles when used to clean surfaces, posing a risk to patients with latex allergies.\\n\\nOption D, use of rubber urethral catheters, may seem like a safe option, but it does not address the broader risk of latex exposure in the patient's environment.\\n\\nGiven the patient's latex allergy and the potential risks associated with each option, the most important consideration in his care is the type of cleaning agents used to sterilize bed linens.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

Low back pain, weakness and areflexia in the legs, saddle anesthesia, or loss of bladder function may occur. The problem must be distinguished from disorders of the lower spinal cord (conus medullaris syndrome), acute transverse myelitis (Chap. 456), and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (Chap. 460). Combined involvement of the conus medullaris and cauda equina can occur. CES is commonly due to a ruptured lumbosacral intervertebral disk, lumbosacral spine fracture, hematoma within the spinal canal (e.g., following lumbar puncture in patients with coagulopathy), compressive tumor, or other mass lesion. Treatment options include surgical decompression, some times urgently in an attempt to restore or preserve motor or sphincter function, or radiotherapy for metastatic tumors (Chap. 118)."

The upper limit of the zone of sensory loss is often one or two vertebrae below the site of compression. Motor findings include weakness, spasticity, and abnormal muscle stretching. An extensor plantar reflex reflects significant compression. Deep tendon reflexes may be brisk. Motor and sensory loss usually precedes sphincter disturbance.

            "content": "The procedure of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is extremely well tolerated and lacks the problems of entering the peritoneal cavity (e.g., paralytic ileus). Unfortunately, a complication of a vertical incision in the midclavicular line is division of the segmental nerve supply to the rectus abdominis muscle. This produces muscle atrophy and asymmetrical proportions of the anterior abdominal wall. A 45-year-old man had mild epigastric pain, and a diagnosis of esophageal reflux was made. He was given appropriate medication, which worked well. However, at the time of the initial consultation, the family practitioner requested a chest radiograph, which demonstrated a prominent hump on the left side of the diaphragm and old rib fractures. The patient was recalled for further questioning."

Incomplete lesions result in varying degrees of urgency in voiding. With slowly evolving processes involving the upper cord, such as multiple sclerosis, the bladder spasticity and urgency worsen with time and incontinence becomes more frequent. In addition, initiation of voluntary micturition is impaired and bladder capacity is reduced. Bladder sensation depends on the extent of involvement of sensory tracts. Bulbocavernosus and anal reflexes are preserved. The cystometrogram shows uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle in response to small volumes of fluid. Most puzzling to the authors have been cases of cervical cord injury in which reflex activity of the sacral mechanism does not return; the bladder remains hypotonic."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem?

At first, continual catheterization is necessary; then, after several weeks, the bladder can be managed by intermittent catheterization once or twice daily, using a scrupulous aseptic technique. Bacteriuria alone is common and does not require treatment with antibiotics unless there is associated pyuria. Morning suppositories and periodically spaced enemas are effective means of controlling fecal incontinence. Chronic pain (present in 30 to 50 percent of cases) requires the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, injections of local anesthetics, and transcutaneous nerve stimulation.

Further to discussion, surgery was planned to \u201crejoin\u201d the patient. At operation the colostomy was \u201ctaken down\u201d and the rectal stump was identified. There was, however, a significant gap between the bowel ends. To enable the bowel to be sutured, the descending colon was mobilized from the posterior abdominal wall. An anastomosis was performed and the patient left the hospital 1 week later and currently remains well. A 72-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (an expansion of the infrarenal abdominal aorta). The aneurysm measured 10 cm, and after discussion with the patient it was scheduled for repair. The surgical and endovascular treatment options were explained to the patient."

The results are better if the decompression is done within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. A central disc herniation causing cauda equina should be differentiated from a postero-lateral disc herniation. The posterolateral disc herniation usu-ally affects a nerve root and can be treated conservatively, at least initially. In the case of central disc herniation, it affects the cauda equina (the lumbosacral nerve roots), and this is a surgical emergency. Spontaneous recovery does not occur, and the outcome is catastrophic, including permanent loss of bowel and bladder control as well as the ability to have an erection if treatment is delayed.Spinal StenosisA loss of hydration of the discs causes loss of disc height and bulging of annular tissue and the ligamentum flavum, which effectively narrows the canal (spinal stenosis)."

Cauda equina syndrome is due to compression of the cauda equina and may result from massive disc herniation, EDH, epidural abscess, tumor, or subluxation from trauma. Patients with cauda equina compression often present with urinary retention, saddle anesthesia, or progressing leg weakness. Saddle anesthesia is numbness in the perineum, genitals, buttocks, and upper inner thighs. Patients with sus-pected cauda equina syndrome should undergo immediate MRI of the lumbar spine to evaluate for a surgical lesion. Mass lesions should be removed urgently via laminectomy to preserve sphincter function and ambulation.Spine Fusion SurgeryFusion surgery is often required for patients with spinal instabil-ity resulting from disease, surgical intervention, or both.
