Contraction of the diaphragm forces the abdominal contents downward and forward. This increases the vertical dimension of the chest cavity and creates a pressure difference between the thorax and abdomen. In adults, the diaphragm can generate airway pressures of up to 150 to 200 cm H2O during maximal inspiratory effort. During quiet breathing (tidal breathing), the diaphragm moves approximately 1 cm; however, during deep-breathing maneuvers (vital capacity), the diaphragm can move as much as 10 cm.

The diaphragm is formed from four structures\u2014 the septum transversum, the posterior esophageal mesentery, the pleuroperitoneal membrane, and the peripheral rim\u2014which eventually fuse together, separating the abdominal cavity from the thoracic cavity. The septum transversum forms the central tendon, which develops from a mesodermal origin superior to the embryo\u2019s head and then moves to its more adult position during folding of the cephalic portion of the embryo. Fusion of the various components of the diaphragm may fail, and hernias may occur through the failed points of fusion (Fig. 4.146).

It contains the heart, esophagus, trachea, major nerves, and major systemic blood vessels. The pleural cavities are completely separated from each other by the mediastinum.

One of the most important roles of the abdominal wall is to assist in breathing: It relaxes during inspiration to accommodate expansion of the thoracic cavity and the inferior displacement of abdominal viscera during contraction of the diaphragm (Fig. 4.3). During expiration, it contracts to assist in elevating the domes of the diaphragm, thus reducing thoracic volume. Material can be expelled from the airway by forced expiration using the abdominal muscles, as in coughing or sneezing. Contraction of abdominal wall muscles can dramatically increase intraabdominal pressure when the diaphragm is in a fixed position (Fig. 4.4). Air is retained in the lungs by closing valves in the larynx in the neck. Increased intra-abdominal pressure assists in voiding the contents of the bladder and rectum and in giving birth."

Instead, the pelvic cavity projects posteriorly, and the inlet opens anteriorly and somewhat superiorly (Fig. 4.10). The abdomen is separated from the thorax by the diaphragm. Structures pass between the two regions through or posterior to the diaphragm (see Fig. 4.8). The pelvic inlet opens directly into the abdomen and structures pass between the abdomen and pelvis through it. The peritoneum lining the abdominal cavity is continuous with the peritoneum in the pelvis. Consequently, the abdominal cavity is entirely continuous with the pelvic cavity (Fig. 4.11).

            "content": "Changes in the anterior, lateral, and vertical dimensions of the thoracic cavity are important for breathing. Innervation of the diaphragm The diaphragm is innervated by two phrenic nerves that originate, one on each side, as branches of the cervical plexus in the neck (Fig. 3.15). They arise from the anterior rami of cervical nerves C3, C4, and C5, with the major contribution coming from C4. The phrenic nerves pass vertically through the neck, the superior thoracic aperture, and the mediastinum to supply motor innervation to the entire diaphragm, including the crura (muscular extensions that attach the diaphragm to the upper lumbar vertebrae). In the mediastinum, the phrenic nerves pass anteriorly to the roots of the lungs."

            "content": "a barium swallow provides the diagnosis in virtually every case. Attention should be focused on the position of the GEJ, when seen, to differentiate it from a type II hernia (see Fig. 25-39B and C). Fiber-optic esophagos-copy is useful in the diagnosis and classification of a hiatal hernia because the scope can be retroflexed. In this position, a sliding hiatal hernia can be identified by noting a gastric pouch lined with rugal folds extending above the impression caused by the crura of the diaphragm, or measuring at least 2 cm between the crura, identified by having the patient sniff, and the squamoco-lumnar junction on withdrawal of the scope (Fig. 25-40). A PEH is identified on retroversion of the scope by noting a separate orifice adjacent to the GEJ into which gastric rugal folds ascend. A sliding-rolling or mixed hernia can be identified by noting a gastric pouch lined with rugal folds above the diaphragm, with the GEJ entering about midway up the side of the"

            "content": "The most common sites for abscess to develop are the pelvis and the hepatorenal recess. When a patient is in the supine position, the lowest points in the abdominal and pelvic cavities are the posterior superior aspect of the peritoneal cavity (the hepatorenal recess) and, in women, the recto-uterine pouch (pouch of Douglas). The shoulder pain suggested that the abscess was in the hepatorenal recess and that the pain was referred from the diaphragm. The motor and sensory innervation of the diaphragm is from nerves C3 to C5. The somatic pain sensation from the parietal peritoneum covering the undersurface of the diaphragm is carried into the spinal cord by the phrenic nerve (C3 to C5) and is interpreted by the brain as coming from skin over the shoulder\u2014a region supplied by other somatic sensory nerves entering the same levels of the spinal cord as those from the diaphragm. A chest radiograph demonstrated elevation of the right hemidiaphragm."
