The documents mention that the muscles of the soft palate are innervated by the vagus nerve [X], except for the tensor veli palatini, which is innervated by the mandibular nerve [V3] via the nerve to the medial pterygoid. The documents also mention that the palatoglossus muscles are innervated by the vagus nerve [X]. However, the palatoglossus is not a muscle of the soft palate, it is a muscle of the tongue. Therefore, the correct answer must be the nerve that innervates the muscles of the soft palate, which is the vagus nerve [X]. We can rule out options A, B, and C because they include the trigeminal nerve, which is not mentioned as innervating the muscles of the soft palate. Option D is the correct answer because it only includes the facial nerve, which is not mentioned as innervating the muscles of the soft palate, and the vagus nerve [X], which is the correct nerve. However, the facial nerve is not the primary nerve that innervates the muscles of the soft palate. The correct answer must be the vagus nerve [X], but since it is not an option, the best available answer is D, facial and vagus nerves, but since the facial nerve is not the primary nerve, we can conclude that the correct answer is the vagus nerve [X] but it is not an option, so we have to choose the best available answer which is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The palatoglossus muscles: elevate the back of the tongue, move the palatoglossal arches of mucosa toward the midline, and depress the soft palate.

            "content": "Like the muscles of mastication, the mylohyoid muscles are innervated by the mandibular nerve [V3]. The specific branch that innervates the mylohyoid muscles is the nerve to the mylohyoid from the inferior alveolar nerve. The geniohyoid muscles (Table 8.20) are paired cord-like muscles that run, one on either side of the midline, from the inferior mental spines on the posterior surface of the mandibular symphysis to the anterior surface of the body of the hyoid bone (Fig. 8.252B,C). They are immediately superior to the mylohyoid muscles in the floor of the mouth and inferior to the genioglossus muscles that form part of the root of the tongue. The geniohyoid muscles: mainly pull the hyoid bone, and therefore the attached larynx, up and forward during swallowing; and because they pass posteroinferiorly from the mandible to the hyoid bone, when the hyoid bone is fixed, they can act with the mylohyoid muscles to depress the mandible and open the mouth."

In the palatine canal, the greater palatine nerve gives origin to posterior inferior nasal nerves, which pass medially through small foramina in the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone and contribute to the innervation of the lateral nasal wall. After passing through the lesser palatine foramen, the lesser palatine nerve passes posteriorly to supply the soft palate. Nasal nerves. The nasal nerves (Fig. 8.156), approximately seven in number, pass medially through the sphenopalatine foramen to enter the nasal cavity. Most pass anteriorly to supply the lateral wall of the nasal cavity, while others pass across the roof to supply the medial wall."

            "content": "The vagus nerve [X] carries GSA, GVA, SA, GVE, and BE fibers: The GSA fibers provide sensory input from the larynx, laryngopharynx, deeper parts of the auricle, part of the external acoustic meatus, and the dura mater in the posterior cranial fossa. The GVA fibers provide sensory input from the aortic body chemoreceptors and aortic arch baroreceptors, and the esophagus, bronchi, lungs, heart, and abdominal viscera in the foregut and midgut. The SA fibers are for taste around the epiglottis and pharynx. The GVE fibers are part of the parasympathetic part of the autonomic division of the PNS and stimulate smooth muscle and glands in the pharynx, larynx, thoracic viscera, and abdominal viscera of the foregut and midgut. The BE fibers innervate one muscle of the tongue (palatoglossus), the muscles of the soft palate (except the tensor veli palatini), pharynx (except the stylopharyngeus), and larynx."

In addition to innervating all lower teeth and much of the associated gingivae, it also supplies the mucosa and skin of the lower lip and skin of the chin. It has one motor branch, which innervates the mylohyoid muscle and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle."

The three types of fibers leave the ganglion as orbital, palatine, nasal, and pharyngeal branches. Orbital branches. The orbital branches are small and pass through the inferior orbital fissure to contribute to the supply of the orbital wall and of the sphenoidal and ethmoidal sinuses. Greater and lesser palatine nerves. The greater and lesser palatine nerves (Fig. 8.156) pass inferiorly from the pterygopalatine ganglion, enter and pass through the palatine canal, and enter the oral surface of the palate through the greater and lesser palatine foramina. The greater palatine nerve passes forward on the roof of the oral cavity to innervate mucosa and glands of the hard palate and the adjacent gingiva, almost as far forward as the incisor teeth."

Taste fibers from the extreme dorsal part of the tongue and the few that arise from taste buds on the pharynx and larynx run in the vagus (X) nerve. The gustatory nucleus is situated in the rostral and lateral parts of the nucleus tractus solitarius, which receive the special afferent (taste) fibers from the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves. Probably both sides of the tongue are represented in this nucleus."
