The American Heart Association (AHA) and other medical organizations provide guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and emergency cardiovascular care. According to these guidelines, the recommended ratio of chest compressions to ventilations during CPR is 30:2. This ratio is intended to balance the need for effective ventilation with the need for adequate chest compressions to maintain perfusion of vital organs. The ratio of 30:2 is based on the idea that 30 compressions are delivered, followed by 2 breaths. This ratio is a compromise between the need for oxygenation and the need for cardiac output. The other options, such as 2:25, 15:02, and 1:05, do not align with the current recommendations and may not provide adequate oxygenation or cardiac output. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 30:02:00.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

However, ventilatory support during CPR has yielded to evidence that continuous chest compressions (\u201chands only\u201d CPR) results in better outcomes. Compressions are interrupted only for single shocks from an AED when available, with 2 min of CPR between each single shock."

            "content": "Children who need cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) usually have a primary respiratory arrest. Hypoxia usually initiates the cascade leading to arrest and also produces organ dysfunction or damage (Table 38-3). The approach to cardiopulmonary arrest extends beyond CPR and includes efforts to preserve vital organ function. The goal in resuscitating a pediatric patient following a cardiopulmonary arrest should be to optimize cardiac output and tissue oxygen delivery, which may be accomplished by using artificial ventilation and chest compression and by the judicious administration of pharmacologic agents. In 2010 the American Heart Association revised the recommendations for resuscitation for adults, children, and infants. The biggest change is the recommendation to start chest compressions immediately, rather than beginning with airway and breathing."

Because hypoxemia is the final common pathway in pediatric cardiopulmonary arrests, providing oxygen is more important than correcting the respiratory acidosis. The clinician should deliver 100% oxygen at a rate of 8 to 10 breaths/min during CPR, or 12 to 20 breaths/min for a patient who has a perfusing rhythm. Use only the tidal volume necessary to produce visible chest rise. Care should be taken not to hyperventilate the patient. When mechanical means fail to re-establish adequate circulation, pharmacologic intervention is essential (Table 38-4).If intravascular access is not present or rapidly established, administration through an intraosseous route is recommended. Some drugs can also be administered effectively through the endotracheal tube."

For this reason the recommendation is to start chest compressions first while preparing for ventilation. For optimal chest compressions, the child should be supine on a flat, hard surface. Effective CPR requires a compression depth of one third to one half of the anterior-posterior diameter of the chest with complete recoil after each compression. The compression rate should be at least 100/min with breaths delivered 8 to 10 times per minute.

The peak airway pressure measured at the end of inspiration (Ppeak) is a function of the tidal volume, the resistance of the airways, lung/chest wall compliance, and peak inspiratory flow. The airway pressure measured at the end of inspiration when the inhaled volume is held in the lungs by briefly clos-ing the expiratory valve is termed the plateau airway pressure (Pplateau). As a static parameter, plateau airway pressure is indepen-dent of the airway resistance and peak airway flow and is related to the lung/chest wall compliance and delivered tidal volume. Mechanical ventilators monitor Ppeak with each breath and can be set to trigger an alarm if the"

            "content": "Treatment should be directed at restoration of normal cardiorespiratory function. This includes securing a clear airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and restoring cerebral perfusion, whether by cardiopulmonary resuscitation, fluid, pressors, or cardiac pacing. Hypothermia may target the neuronal cell injury cascade and has substantial neuroprotective properties in experimental models of brain injury. In two trials, mild hypothermia (33\u00b0C) improved functional outcome in patients who remained comatose after resuscitation from a cardiac arrest. Treatment was initiated within minutes of cardiac resuscitation and continued for 12 h in one study and 24 h in the other. Potential complications of hypothermia include coagulopathy and an increased risk of infection. Based on these studies, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation issued the following advisory statement: \u201cUnconscious adult patients with spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest"

            "content": "During maternal resuscitation, because of pregnancy-induced hindrances on CPR eforts, emergent perimortem cesarean delivey for fetal salvage and improved maternal resuscitation may be considered. Some have stated that cesarean delivery is indicated within 4 to 5 minutes of beginning CPR if the fetus is viable (Drukker, 2014). In women delivered by perimortem cesarean, neurologically intact neonatal survival and the cardiac arrest-todelivery interval are inversely related (Katz, 2012). Speciically, of newborns delivered within 5 minutes of arrest, 98 percent are neurologically intact; within 6 to 15 minutes, 83 percent are intact; within 16 to 25 minutes, 33 percent are intact; and within 26 to 35 minutes, only 25 percent are intact (Clark, 1997). This, coupled with some evidence that delivery may also enhance maternal resuscitation, has led the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017b) to recommend consideration for cesarean delivery to begin within 4 minutes of"

The spontaneous breathing trial is declared a failure and stopped if any of the following occur: (1) respiratory rate >35/min for >5 min, (2) O2 saturation <90%, (3) heart rate >140/min or a 20% increase or decrease from baseline, (4) systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or >180 mmHg, or (5) increased anxiety or diaphoresis. If, at the end of the spontaneous breathing trial, none of the above events has occurred and the ratio of the respiratory rate and tidal volume in liters (f/VT) is <105, the patient can be extubated. Such protocol-driven approaches to patient care can have an important impact on the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. In spite of such a careful approach to liberation from mechanical ventilation, up to 10% of patients develop respiratory"
