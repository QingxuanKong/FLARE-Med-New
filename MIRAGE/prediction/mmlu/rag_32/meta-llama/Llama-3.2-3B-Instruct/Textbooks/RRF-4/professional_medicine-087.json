    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and examination findings presented in the scenario and correlate them with the potential diagnoses provided. The patient is a 75-year-old woman with band-like, burning pain in her right upper abdomen that extends from the epigastrium to the midline of the back. The pain is not accompanied by abdominal tenderness to palpation, and the serum amylase concentration is within the reference range. The ultrasonography of the gallbladder is normal. The key points to consider are: * The pain is described as band-like and burning, which is a characteristic feature of acute cholecystitis. * The pain is located in the right upper abdomen, which is a common location for gallbladder pathology. * The lack of abdominal tenderness to palpation does not rule out gallbladder disease, as some patients may have a normal physical examination despite having gallbladder pathology. * The normal serum amylase concentration makes acute pancreatitis less likely. * The normal ultrasonography of the gallbladder does not rule out gallbladder disease, as some gallstones may not be visible on ultrasound. Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is acalculous cholecystitis, which is a form of gallbladder inflammation that occurs in the absence of gallstones. It is more common in older adults and can be caused by various factors, including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. The other options can be ruled out based on the following: * Chronic relapsing pancreatitis is unlikely given the normal serum amylase concentration and the lack of other symptoms typical of pancreatitis, such as jaundice or weight loss. * Diverticulitis of the cecum is unlikely given the location and description of the pain, which is more typical of gallbladder pathology. * Herpes zoster is unlikely given the description of the pain and the lack of other symptoms typical of herpes zoster, such as rash or vesicles. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acalculous cholecystitis.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"A\"",

The diagnosis is established by two of the following three criteria: (1) typical abdominal pain in the epigastrium that may radiate to the back, (2) threefold or greater elevation in serum lipase and/or amylase, and (3) confirmatory findings of acute pancreatitis on cross-sectional abdominal imaging. Patients also have associated nausea, emesis, fever, tachycardia, and abnormal findings on abdominal examination. Laboratory studies may reveal leukocytosis, hypocalcemia, and hyperglycemia.

            "content": "APPROACH TO THE PATIENT: Abdominal pain is the major symptom of acute pancreatitis. Pain may vary from a mild discomfort to severe, constant, and incapacitating distress. Characteristically, the pain, which is steady and boring in character, is located in the epigastrium and periumbilical region, and may radiate to the back, chest, flanks, and lower abdomen. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention due to gastric and intestinal hypomotility and chemical peritonitis are also frequent complaints."

            "content": "Biliary colic begins quite suddenly and may persist with severe intensity for 30 min to 5 h, subsiding gradually or rapidly. It is steady rather than intermittent, as would be suggested by the word colic, which must be regarded as a misnomer, although it is in widespread use. An episode of biliary pain persisting beyond 5 h should raise the suspicion of acute cholecystitis (see below). Nausea and vomiting frequently accompany episodes of biliary pain. An elevated level of serum bilirubin and/or alkaline phosphatase suggests a common duct stone. Fever or chills (rigors) with biliary pain usually imply a complication, i.e., cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or cholangitis. Complaints of short-lasting, vague epigastric fullness, dyspepsia, eructation, or flatulence, especially following a fatty meal, should not be confused with biliary pain. Such symptoms are frequently elicited from patients with or without gallstone disease Diseases of the Gallbladder and Bile Ducts"

            "content": "Pain referred to the abdomen from the thorax , spine, or genitalia may present a vexing diagnostic challenge because diseases of the upper part of the abdominal cavity such as acute cholecystitis or perforated ulcer may be associated with intrathoracic complications. A most important, yet often forgotten, dictum is that the possibility of intra-thoracic disease must be considered in every patient with abdominal pain, especially if the pain is in the upper abdomen."

            "content": "Inspection of the abdomen may reveal distention from obstruction, tumor, or ascites or vascular abnormalities with liver disease. Ecchymoses develop with severe pancreatitis. Auscultation can detect bruits or friction rubs from vascular disease or hepatic tumors. Loss of bowel sounds signifies ileus, whereas high-pitched, hyperactive sounds characterize intestinal obstruction. Percussion assesses liver size and can detect shifting dullness from ascites. Palpation assesses for hepatosplenomegaly as well as neoplastic or inflammatory masses. Abdominal exam is helpful in evaluating unexplained pain. Intestinal ischemia elicits severe pain but little tenderness. Patients with visceral pain may exhibit generalized discomfort, whereas those with parietal pain or peritonitis have directed pain, often with involuntary guarding, rigidity, or rebound. Patients with musculoskeletal abdominal wall pain may note tenderness exacerbated by Valsalva or straight-leg lift maneuvers."

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

A positive \u03b2-hCG in the setting of shock is a ruptured ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise. Abdominal pain plus syncope or shock in an older patient is a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) until proven otherwise. If the patient is stable, a complete physical exam\u2014including a rectal exam and, in women, a pelvic exam\u2014is mandatory.
