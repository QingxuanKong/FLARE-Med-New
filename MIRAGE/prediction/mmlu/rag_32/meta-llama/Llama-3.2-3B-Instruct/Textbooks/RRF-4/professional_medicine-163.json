At the time of the initial wound, he was discharged after 6 hours of observation with no fractures or soft-tissue swelling. A loud murmur is heard on auscultation; there is a thrill. He has dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves in the lower leg. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the given information step by step. The patient was shot in the right thigh 5 years ago and is now presenting with a buzzing sensation adjacent to the scar, a loud murmur, and a thrill. The patient also has dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves in the lower leg. This suggests a vascular anomaly that involves both arterial and venous components. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are indicative of a vascular connection between the arterial and venous systems, which could be an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). An AVF is an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein, which can cause a murmur and thrill due to the abnormal blood flow. The presence of dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves further supports this diagnosis. The other options do not explain the combination of arterial and venous findings. Arterial spasm (A) would not cause dilated varicose veins or a thrill. Deep venous thrombosis (C) would not produce a murmur or thrill. Occlusion of the superficial femoral artery (D) would not result in dilated varicose veins or an AVF. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is an arteriovenous fistula (B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Afterward an appreciable subcutaneous hematoma developed in the ankle. The diagnostic possibilities include a bone or soft tissue injury. A bony injury was excluded because there was no bone tenderness. The patient had a significant soft tissue injury. On examination he had significant swelling of the ankle with a subcutaneous hematoma. He was unable to stand on tiptoe on the right leg, and in the prone position a palpable defect was demonstrated within the calcaneal tendon. A diagnosis of calcaneal tendon rupture was made. This patient has a typical history of ruptured calcaneal tendon and the clinical findings support this. Magnetic resonance imaging was carried out and confirmed the diagnosis (eFig. 6.144). The patient underwent an operative repair. The tendon healed well, though the patient has not gone back to playing squash."

The multiple dilated veins around the neck are indicative of venous obstruction. The veins are dilated on both sides of the neck, implying that the obstruction must be within a common vessel, the superior vena cava. Anterior to the superior vena cava in the right side of the chest is the phrenic nerve, which supplies the diaphragm. Because the diaphragm is elevated, suggesting paralysis, it is clear that the phrenic nerve has been involved with the tumor. A 35-year-old man was shot during an armed robbery. The bullet entry wound was in the right fourth intercostal space, above the nipple. A chest radiograph obtained on admission to the emergency room demonstrated complete collapse of the lung. A further chest radiograph performed 20 minutes later demonstrated an air/fluid level in the pleural cavity (eFig. 3.117)."

She made an uneventful recovery, but was extremely concerned about the nature of her illness and went to see her local doctor. A diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) was made. A TIA is a neurological deficit resolving within 24 hours. It is a type of stroke. Neurological deficits may be permanent or transient. Most transient events resolve within 21 days; any failure of resolution beyond 21 days is an established stroke. An investigation into the cause of the TIA was undertaken. Eighty-five percent of all strokes result from cerebral infarction, of which most are due to embolization. A duplex Doppler scan of the carotid vessels was performed."

            "content": "In the clinic Varicose veins are tortuous dilated veins that typically occur in the legs, although they may occur in the superficial veins of the arm and in other organs. In normal individuals the movement of adjacent leg muscles pumps the blood in the veins to the heart. Blood is also pumped from the superficial veins through the investing layer of fascia of the leg into the deep veins. Valves in these perforating veins may become damaged, allowing blood to pass in the opposite direction. This increased volume and pressure produces dilatation and tortuosity of the superficial veins (Fig. 1.27). Apart from the unsightliness of larger veins, the skin may become pigmented and atrophic with a poor response to tissue trauma. In some patients even small trauma may produce skin ulceration, which requires elevation of the limb and application of pressure bandages to heal."

A tourniquet was placed around the upper thigh below the saphenofemoral junction and the patient was asked to stand up. No veins were demonstrated filling on the medial aspect of the thigh and lower limb. The effect of the tourniquet is to compress the great saphenous vein while permitting blood to flow in the deep venous system of the femoral vein and the deep femoral vein. Because there was no filling of the medial varicose veins below the level of the tourniquet, the surgeon assumed that the valve at the saphenofemoral junction was incompetent and would require surgical treatment.

The patient was known to have a left renal cell carcinoma and was due to have this operated on the following week. Anatomically it is possible to link all of the findings with the renal cell carcinoma by knowing the biology of the tumor. Renal cell carcinoma tends to grow steadily and predictably. Typically, when the tumor is less than 3 to 4 cm, it remains confined to the kidney. Large tumors have the propensity to grow into the renal vein, the inferior vena cava and the right atrium and through the heart into the pulmonary artery."

High-velocity gunshot wounds (bullet speed >2000 ft/s) are infrequent in the civilian setting. Shotgun injuries are divided into close-range (<20 feet) and long-range wounds. Close-range shotgun wounds are tantamount to high-velocity wounds because the entire energy of the load is delivered to a small area, often with devastating results.

He was recently incarcerated near Bakersfield, California and returned to Oakland about 3 months ago. He is currently experiencing one month of severe headache and double vision. He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

A Doppler ultrasound scan revealed marked stenosis of the subclavian artery at the outer border of the rib with abnormal flow distal to the narrowing. Within this region of abnormal flow there was evidence of thrombus adherent to the vessel wall. This patient underwent surgical excision of the cervical rib and had no further symptoms. A 52-year-old man presented with headaches and shortness of breath. He also complained of coughing up small volumes of blood. Clinical examination revealed multiple dilated veins around the neck. A chest radiograph demonstrated an elevated diaphragm on the right and a tumor mass, which was believed to be a primary bronchogenic carcinoma. By observing the clinical findings and applying anatomical knowledge, the site of the tumor can be inferred."

            "content": "If a previously stable chest trauma patient suddenly dies, suspect air embolism. A new diastolic murmur after chest trauma suggests aortic dissection. The absence of pain does not rule out an abdominal injury. Gunshot wounds usually require immediate exploratory laparotomy, although stable patients can be managed conservatively in select cases. Stab wounds in a hemodynamically unstable patient or in a patient with peritoneal signs or evisceration require immediate exploratory laparotomy. Stab wounds in a hemodynamically stable patient warrant a CT or FAST scan followed by close inpatient observation. \u25a0Complete neurovascular assessment is critical; check pulses, motor function, and sensory function. Arteriography and surgical management are required for patients with suspected vascular injuries. Nerve injuries generally require surgical repair."

While the diagnosis is usu-ally based on clinical exam, compartment pressures can be mea-sured with needles placed into the compartment, which is necessary in unconscious patients and those who will not coop-erate with the exam. Compartment pressure within 30 mmHg of the diastolic pressure is diagnostic of compartment syndrome. When compartment syndrome is suspected, emergent fasciot-omy (Fig. 43-5A,B) must be performed in which the overlying tight fascia is released through long incisions. Fasciotomy must be done as soon as possible to prevent damage to muscles and nerves that will result in irreversible necrosis and Volkmann\u2019s ischemic contractures with severe loss of function.TREATMENT OF FRACTURES AND DISLOCATIONSClavicle FracturesFractures of the clavicle are one of the most common fractures in orthopedics.

            "content": "In this patient, compression of the left external iliac veins by the gravid uterus was the likely cause of stasis, which led to the deep vein thrombosis. The chest pain was due to pulmonary emboli. Small emboli were thrown off from the leading edge of the thrombus through the heart to lodge in the lungs. Small emboli cause typical pleuritic chest pain, which is exacerbated by breathing. In isolation these small pulmonary emboli may affect respiratory function, but they may be the precursor to a large and potentially fatal pulmonary embolus (eFig. 6.143). Anticoagulation was instituted and the patient had an uneventful delivery. A 45-year-old man had recently taken up squash. During a game he attempted a forehand shot and noticed severe sudden pain in his heel. He thought his opponent had hit him with his racket. When he turned, though, he realized his opponent was too far away to have hit him."
