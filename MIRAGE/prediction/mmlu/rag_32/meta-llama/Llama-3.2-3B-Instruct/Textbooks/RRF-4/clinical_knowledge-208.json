The goal of pain management is to provide adequate pain relief while minimizing side effects and optimizing patient outcomes. For surgical patients, the primary concern is to minimize opioid-related side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression, while ensuring effective pain control. The ACS NSQIP and AGS guidelines emphasize the importance of proactive preoperative planning, including analgesia strategies, to minimize opioid use and optimize outcomes. Regular administration of analgesic drugs can help to reduce the need for 'as-needed' doses and minimize breakthrough pain. However, the key is to find the right balance between providing adequate pain relief and minimizing side effects. The best approach is to use long-acting drugs regularly, with provision for additional 'as-required' pain relief for breakthrough pain. This approach allows for better pain control, reduces the risk of opioid-related side effects, and promotes patient comfort and satisfaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Studies consistently show that 25% to 50% of patients suffer moderate to severe pain in the postoperative period (38,39). There are several reasons for the existing inadequacies in pain management. First, patient expectations of pain relief are low and they are not aware of the extent of analgesia that they should expect. In a study of the perception of pain relief after surgery, 86% of patients had moderate to severe pain after surgery, but 70% felt that the pain was as severe as they expected (40). Second, there is a lack of formal physician training in pain management.

Local anesthesia can also be produced by various chemical or physical means. However, in routine clinical practice, it is achieved with a rather narrow spectrum of compounds, and recovery is normally spontaneous, predictable, and without residual effects. The development of these compounds has a rich history (see Box: Historical Development of Local Anesthesia), punctuated by serendipitous observations, delayed starts, and an evolution driven more by concerns for safety than improvements in efficacy."

This approach to bioethics is a powerful technique for thinking through moral problems because the four princi-ples help identify what is at stake in any proposed course of action. However, the principles themselves do not resolve ethi-cal dilemmas. Working together, patients and surgeons must use wise judgment to choose the best course of action for the specific case.Why Ethics Matter 2061Definitions and Overview 2061Specific Issues in Surgical Ethics 2062Informed Consent / 2062The Boundaries of Autonomy: Advance Directives and Powers of Attorney / 2064Withdrawing and Withholding Life-Sustaining Therapies / 2065Living Donor Liver Transplantation / 2066Palliative Care 2066General Principles of Palliative Care / 2066Concepts of Suffering, Pain, Health, and Healing / 2067Effective Communication and Negotiating the Goals of Care / 2067Care at the End of Life 2068The Syndrome of Imminent"

EBM is defined by three epistemological principles4:\u2022 Principle 1: Not all evidence is created equal, and the practice of medicine should be based on the best available evidence\u2022 Principle 2: The pursuit of truth is best accomplished by evaluation of the totality of the evidence, and not selecting evidence that favors a particular claim\u2022 Principle 3: Clinical decision-making requires consideration of patients\u2019 values and preferenceThe adoption of EBM in the discipline of surgery has lagged compared to nonsurgical specialties. To a great extent, this is due to the challenges of achieving the highest level of evidence noted in principle 1: definitive conclusions from a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A literature analysis of MEDLINE from 1966 to 2000 demonstrated that only 15.1% of the 134,689 RCTs evaluated a surgical topic.5 In the early days of EBM during the 1990s, surgical RCTs accounted for only 7% of published articles in surgical journals; most of the"

The ACS NSQIP and the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) published best practice guidelines to help optimize this process. Preoperative planning should be pro-active, commencing at the time of surgical decision-making, if not sooner. To this end, the ACS NSQIP/AGS produced best practice guidelines and a preoperative management checklist to provide a framework for thinking about critical issues in this patient population (Table 47-2).22 In addition to these issues, they emphasize the importance of planning analgesia strategies, making efforts to minimize opioid use and to"
