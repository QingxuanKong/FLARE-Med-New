The first line of defense includes anatomic barriers, such as the skin and mucosal surfaces, and chemical defenses, like antimicrobial peptides and enzymes. However, the question specifically asks for the defense mechanism against environmental bacteria, which are typically inhaled or ingested. Among the options provided, mucous membranes are a critical defense mechanism against environmental bacteria, particularly those that enter the body through the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. Mucous membranes, such as those lining the nose, throat, and lungs, produce mucus that traps and neutralizes pathogens, preventing them from entering the body. Additionally, the mucous membranes also produce antimicrobial peptides and enzymes that help to kill or inactivate bacteria. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

We first describe the anatomic barriers that protect the host against infection and examine the immediate innate defenses provided by various secreted soluble proteins. The anatomic barriers are fixed defenses against infection and consist of the epithelia that line the internal and external surfaces of the body along with the phagocytes residing beneath all epithelial surfaces. These phagocytes act directly by engulfing and digesting invading microorganisms. Epithelia are also protected by many kinds of chemical defenses, including antimicrobial enzymes and peptides. Next we describe the complement system, which directly kills some microorganisms and interacts with others to promote their removal by phagocytic cells. The complement system together with other soluble circulating defensive proteins is sometimes referred to as humoral innate immunity, from the old word \u2018humor\u2019 for body fluids.

The mammalian immune response to invading organisms proceeds in three phases, beginning with immediate innate defenses, then the induced innate defenses, and finally adaptive immunity.

Through particular cell-surface interactions, highly differentiated epithelia protect against both microbial colonization and invasion. Defense mechanisms of epithelia include the prevention of pathogen adherence, secretion of antimicrobial enzymes and bactericidal peptides, and the flow caused by the actions of cilia.

When a pathogen breaches the host\u2019s epithelial barriers and initial antimicrobial defenses, it next encounters a major component of innate immunity known as the complement system, or complement. Complement is a collection of soluble proteins present in blood and other body fluids. It was discovered in the 1890s by Jules Bordet as a heat-labile substance in normal plasma whose activity could \u2018complement\u2019 the bactericidal activity of immune sera. Part of the process is opsonization, which refers to coating a pathogen with antibodies and/or complement proteins so that it can be more readily taken up and destroyed by phagocytic cells. Although complement was first discovered as an effector arm of the antibody response, we now understand that it originally evolved as part of the innate immune system and that it still provides protection early in infection, in the absence of antibodies, through more ancient pathways of complement activation."

Endotoxins, which are intrinsic components of microbial structure, trigger phagocytes to release cytokines that produce local or systemic symptoms.

            "content": "Innate Immunity: The First Lines of Defense As introduced in Chapter 1, most microbial invaders can be detected and destroyed within minutes or hours by the body\u2019s defense mechanisms of innate immunity, which do not rely on expansion of antigen-specific lymphocytes. The innate immune system uses a limited number of secreted proteins and cell-associated receptors to detect infection and to distinguish between pathogens and host tissues. These are called innate receptors because they are inborn; they are encoded by genes directly inherited from an individual\u2019s parents, and do not need to be generated by the gene rearrangements used to assemble antigen receptors of lymphocytes described in Section 1-11. The importance of innate immunity is illustrated by several immunodeficiencies that result when it is impaired, discussed in Chapter 13, which increase susceptibility to infection even in the presence of an intact adaptive immune system."

            "content": "We normally think of pathogens as hostile invaders, but a pathogen, like any other organism, is simply exploiting an available niche in which to live and procreate. Living on or in a host organism is a very effective strategy, and it is possible that every organism on Earth is subject to some type of infection (Figure 23\u20131). A human host is a nutrient-rich, warm, and moist environment, which remains at a uniform temperature and constantly renews itself. It is not surprising that many microorganisms have evolved the ability to survive and reproduce in this desirable niche. In this section, we discuss some of the common features that microorganisms must have in order to colonize the human body or cause disease, and we explore the wide variety of organisms that are known to cause disease. The Human Microbiota Is a Complex Ecological System That Is Important for Our Development and Health"
