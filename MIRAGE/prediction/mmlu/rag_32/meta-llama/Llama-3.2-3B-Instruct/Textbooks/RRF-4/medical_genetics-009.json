    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what exon skipping is and what type of mutations are associated with it. Exon skipping is a process in RNA splicing where a portion of the exons are removed from the pre-mRNA, resulting in a mature mRNA molecule that contains different exons than the normal splicing pattern. This can lead to a different protein being produced or a protein with a different function. Now, let's examine the options given in the question and relate them to exon skipping.\\n\\nExon skipping is most commonly associated with mutations that affect the splicing process, such as those that create new splice-acceptor sites or disrupt the normal splicing machinery. These types of mutations can lead to the skipping of exons during RNA splicing.\\n\\nOption A, nonsense mutations, can also lead to exon skipping. Nonsense mutations are point mutations that create a premature stop codon in the protein sequence, which can lead to the skipping of exons during splicing. However, not all nonsense mutations result in exon skipping.\\n\\nOption B, regulatory mutations, can also affect splicing, but they are not the primary cause of exon skipping. Regulatory mutations can affect the binding of splicing factors or the structure of the pre-mRNA, but they do not necessarily lead to exon skipping.\\n\\nOption C, RNA processing mutations, is the correct answer. RNA processing mutations, such as those that create new splice-acceptor sites or disrupt the normal splicing machinery, are the primary cause of exon skipping. These mutations can lead to the skipping of exons during RNA splicing and result in a different protein being produced.\\n\\nOption D, silent mutations, are not associated with exon skipping. Silent mutations are point mutations that do not change the amino acid sequence of the protein, and they do not affect splicing.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. RNA processing mutations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

The machinery that catalyzes pre-mRNA splicing is complex, consisting of five addi-tional RNA molecules and several hundred proteins, and it hydrolyzes many ATP molecules per splicing event. This complexity ensures that splicing is accurate, while at the same time being flexible enough to deal with the enormous variety of introns found in a typical eukaryotic cell. It may seem wasteful to remove large numbers of introns by RNA splicing. In attempting to explain why it occurs, scientists have pointed out that the exon\u2013 intron arrangement would seem to facilitate the emergence of new and useful proteins over evolutionary time scales.

In addition, changes in chromatin structure are used to alter splicing patterns. There are two ways this can happen. First, because splicing and transcription are coupled, the rate at which RNA polymerase moves along DNA can affect RNA splicing. For example, if polymerase is moving slowly, exon skipping (see Figure 6\u201330A) is minimized: assembly of the initial spliceosome may be complete before an alternative choice of splice site even emerges from the RNA polymerase.

Instead, the mutation typically creates a new pattern of splicing (Figure 6\u201333). Most commonly, an exon is simply skipped (Figure 6\u201333B). In other cases, the mutation causes a cryptic splice junction to be efficiently used (Figure 6\u201333C). Apparently, the splicing machinery has evolved to pick out the best possible pattern of splice junctions, and if the optimal one is damaged by mutation, it will seek out the next best pattern, and so on. This inherent plasticity in the process of RNA splicing suggests that changes in splicing patterns caused by random mutations have been important in the evolution of genes and organisms.

In the examples shown, the disease (a severe anemia due to aberrant hemoglobin synthesis) is caused by splice-site mutations found in the genomes of affected patients. The dark blue boxes represent the three normal exon sequences; the red lines connect the 5\u02b9 and 3\u02b9 splice sites that are used. In (B), (C), and (D), the light blue boxes depict new nucleotide sequences included in the final mRNA molecule as a result of the mutation denoted by the black arrowhead. Note that when a mutation leaves a normal splice site without a partner, an exon is skipped (B) or one or more abnormal cryptic splice sites nearby is used as the partner site (C).

            "content": "B. Messenger RNA processing and use Eukaryotic mRNA undergoes several processing events before it is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for use in protein synthesis. Capping at the 5\u2032-end (see p. 441), polyadenylation at the 3\u2032-end (see p. 442), and splicing (see p. 442) are essential for the production of a functional eukaryotic messenger from most pre-mRNA. Variations in splicing and polyadenylation can affect gene expression. In addition, messenger stability also affects gene expression. 1. Alternative splicing: Tissue-specific protein isoforms can be made from the same pre-mRNA through alternative splicing, which can involve exon skipping (loss), intron retention, and use of alternative splice-donor or -acceptor sites (Fig. 33.12). For example, the pre-mRNA for tropomyosin (TM) undergoes tissue-specific alternative splicing to yield a number of TM isoforms (see p. 443). [Note: Over 90% of all human genes undergo alternative splicing.] 2."

            "content": "In some cases, alternative RNA splicing occurs because there is an intron sequence ambiguity: the standard spliceosome mechanism for removing intron sequences (discussed in Chapter 6) is unable to distinguish clearly between two or more alternative pairings of 5\u02b9 and 3\u02b9 splice sites, so that different choices are made by chance on different individual transcripts. Where such constitutive alternative splicing occurs, several versions of the protein encoded by the gene are made in all cells in which the gene is expressed."

Some patients cannot tolerate glucocorticoid therapy; weight gain and increased risk of fractures in particular represent a significant deterrent for some boys. As in other recessively inherited dystrophies presumed to arise from loss of function of a critical muscle gene, there is optimism that Duchenne disease may benefit from novel therapies that either replace the defective gene or missing protein or implement downstream corrections (e.g., skipping mutated exons or reading through mutations that introduce stop codons). This less severe form of X-linked recessive muscular dystrophy results from allelic defects of the same gene responsible for Duchenne dystrophy. Becker muscular dystrophy is ~10 times less frequent than Duchenne."
