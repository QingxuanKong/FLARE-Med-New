This clinical presentation and microbiological findings are highly suggestive of Staphylococcus aureus infection, particularly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), given the mecA-positive result. The patient's underlying condition, chronic granulomatous disease, also increases the risk of infections with MRSA. The appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient should be effective against MRSA. Vancomycin is a commonly used antibiotic for treating MRSA infections and is often considered a drug of choice for serious or severe infections, including those in immunocompromised patients or those with severe disease. Therefore, Vancomycin is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Material obtained by needle aspiration of lymph nodes early in the illness should be examined similarly. Examination of wet preparations and Giemsa-stained thin and thick films of serial blood samples is also useful. If parasites are not seen initially in blood, efforts should be made to concentrate the organisms, which can be done in microhematocrit tubes containing acridine orange. Alternatively, the buffy coat from 10\u201315 mL of anti-coagulated blood can be examined directly under a microscope. The likelihood of finding parasites in blood is higher in stage 1 than in stage 2 disease and in patients infected with T. b. rhodesiense rather than T. b. gambiense. Trypanosomes may also be seen in material aspirated from the bone marrow; the"

The differential includes gonorrhea, endometriosis, PID, orchitis, vaginitis, and UTI. Lymphogranuloma venereum presents in its 1\u00b0 form as a painless, transient papule or shallow ulcer. In its 2\u00b0 form, it presents as painful swelling of the inguinal nodes, and in its 3\u00b0 form it can present as an \u201canogenital syndrome\u201d (anal pruritus with discharge, rectal strictures, rectovaginal f stula, and elephantiasis). Diagnosis is usually clinical. Culture is the gold standard. Urine tests (PCR or ligase chain reaction) are a rapid means of detection, while DNA probes and immunofuorescence (for gonorrhea/chlamydia) take 48\u201372 hours. Gram stain of urethral or genital discharge may show PMNs but no bacteria (intracellular). Chlamydia infection is a common cause of nongonococcal urethritis in men."

Needle biopsy of the pleura is often required for diagnosis and is recommended over pleural fluid; it reveals granulomas and/or yields a positive culture in up to 80% of cases. Pleural biopsy can yield a positive result in ~75% of cases when real-time automated nucleic acid amplification is used (the Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF assay [Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA]; see \u201cNucleic Acid Amplification Technology,\u201d below), although pleural fluid testing with this assay is not recommended because of low sensitivity. This form of pleural TB responds rapidly to chemotherapy and may resolve spontaneously. Concurrent glucocorticoid administration may reduce the duration of fever and/or chest pain but is not of proven benefit. Tuberculous empyema is a less common complication of pulmonary TB. It is usually the result of the rupture of a cavity, with spillage of a large number of organisms into the"

Lymph nodes enlarge because of edema and hyperplasia of lymphatic nodules and their cellular components (Fig. F14.4.1). These include B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, macrophages, and other antigen-presenting cells. In addition, infiltration of lymphatic sinuses by neutrophils is also prominent. In severe bacterial infections, lymphadenitis may be accompanied by lymphangitis, an inflammation of afferent lymphatic vessels that carry infected lymph into regional lymph nodes. Inflamed lymph vessels may be visible as red streaks under the skin in the affected area of lymphatic drainage. Common symptoms of acute lymphadenitis are swollen lymph nodes that are tender to palpation, fever, chills, loss of appetite, tachycardia, and general weakness. Lymph"
