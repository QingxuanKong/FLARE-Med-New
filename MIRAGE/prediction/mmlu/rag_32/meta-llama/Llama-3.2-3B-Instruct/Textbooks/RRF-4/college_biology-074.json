Let's analyze each option given in the multiple-choice question:\\n\", \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Option A: Air provides more physical support. Air is less dense than water, which means it provides less physical support. Water is a more effective medium for supporting the weight of objects due to its higher density.\\n\", \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Option B: Air has a higher O2 concentration. Air is composed of approximately 21% oxygen, while water has a very low oxygen concentration. So, air has a higher O2 concentration.\\n\", \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Option C: Air offers more resistance to motion. Air is less dense than water, which means it offers less resistance to motion. Water is a more viscous fluid, resulting in more resistance to motion.\\n\", \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Option D: Air has more thermal inertia. Thermal inertia refers to the ability of a substance to resist changes in temperature. Water has a higher specific heat capacity than air, meaning it can absorb and release heat more efficiently, resulting in more thermal inertia.\\n\", \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the analysis, the correct answer is B.

As depicted in Fig. 2.1 , there are multiple inputs and outputs of water, many of which can vary but nevertheless cannot be regulated. For example, the amount of water lost through the lungs depends on the humidity of the air and the rate of respiration (e.g., low humidity and rapid breathing increase water loss from the lungs). Similarly, the amount of water lost as sweat varies according to ambient temperature and physical activity. Finally, water loss via the gastrointestinal tract can increase from a normal level of 100 to 200 mL/day to many liters with acute diarrhea. Of these inputs and outputs, the only two that can be regulated are increased ingestion of water in response to thirst and alterations in urine output by the kidneys (see Chapter 35)."

The first is that when the components are viewed in terms of gas fractions (F), the sum of the individual gas fractions must equal one: Equation 23.6 1 0. = FN2 + FO2 + Fargon and other gases It follows, then, that the sum of the partial pressures (in millimeters of mercury) of a gas, also known as the gas tension (in torr), must be equal to the total pressure.

Most famously, he investigated an outbreak of cholera in London in 1854 that killed more than 600 victims before it was finished. Snow recorded where the victims lived, and plotted the data on a map, along with the locations of the water pumps that served as the source of water for the public (Figure Q23\u20132). He concluded that the disease was most likely spread in the water, although he could find nothing suspicious-looking in it. His conclusion ran counter to the then-current belief that cholera was from \u201cmiasmas\u201d in bad air. Very few believed his theory during the next 50 years, with the \u201cbad air\u201d theory persisting until at least 1901. What do you suppose Snow saw in the data that led him to his conclusion? Why do you think most scientists remained skeptical for so long?"

These differences in oxygen tension have profound effects on arterial blood gas values. As inspiration begins, ambient air is brought into the nasopharynx and laryngopharynx, where it becomes warmed to body temperature and humidified. Inspired air becomes saturated with water vapor by the time it reaches the glottis. Water vapor exerts a partial pressure and dilutes the total pressure in which the other gases are distributed. Water vapor pressure at body temperature is 47 mm Hg. To calculate the partial pressures of O2 and N2 in a humidified mixture, the water vapor partial pressure must be subtracted from the total barometric pressure. Thus in the conducting airways, which begin in the trachea, the partial pressure of O2 is calculated as follows: Equation 23.10 = . = 150 mm Hg and the partial pressure of N2 is calculated similarly:"

Explain why or why not. 14\u20131 The three respiratory enzyme complexes in the mitochondrial inner membrane tend to associate with each other in ways that facilitate the correct transfer of electrons between appropriate complexes. 14\u20132 The number of c subunits in the rotor ring of ATP synthase defines how many protons need to pass through the turbine to make each molecule of ATP. 14\u20133 Mutations that are inherited according to Mendelian rules affect nuclear genes; mutations whose inheritance violates Mendelian rules are likely to affect organelle genes. Discuss the following problems. 14\u20134 In the 1860s, Louis Pasteur noticed that when he added O2 to a culture of yeast growing anaerobically on glucose, the rate of glucose consumption declined dramatically. Explain the basis for this result, which is known as the Pasteur effect."

It may be found in supersecondary structures. Correct answer = C. The \u03b2-sheet is stabilized by interchain hydrogen bonds formed between separate polypeptide chains and by intrachain hydrogen bonds formed between regions of a single polypeptide. The \u03b1-helix, however, is stabilized only by intrachain hydrogen bonds. Statements A, B, D, and E are true for both of these secondary structural elements. .4. An 80-year-old man presented with impairment of intellectual function and alterations in behavior. His family reported progressive disorientation and memory loss over the last 6 months. There is no family history of dementia. The patient was tentatively diagnosed with Alzheimer disease (AD). Which one of the following best describes AD? A. It is associated with \u03b2-amyloid, an abnormal protein with an altered amino acid sequence."

Primary standards regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designed to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety exist for sulfur dioxide, particulates matter, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, lead, and carbon monoxide. Standards for each of these pollutants are updated regularly through an extensive review process conducted by the EPA. (For details on current standards, go to http://www.epa.gov/air/criteria.html.)"

Its synthesis involves a nonfunctional precursor that gets cleaved to yield a functional molecule. Correct answer = D. Secretion of insulin by pancreatic \u03b2 cells is inhibited by the catecholamines, whereas glucagon secretion by the \u03b1 cells is stimulated by them. All of the other statements are true for both insulin and glucagon. 3.2. In which one of the following tissues is glucose transport into the cell insulin dependent? A. Adipose B. Brain C. Liver D. Red blood cells Correct answer = A. The glucose transporter (GLUT-4) in adipose (and muscle) tissue is dependent on insulin. Insulin results in movement of GLUT-4 from intracellular vesicles to the cell membrane. The other tissues in the list contain GLUT that are independent of insulin because they are always located on the cell membrane."

Acidosis decreases the solubility of HbS. B. Acidosis increases the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. C. Acidosis favors the conversion of hemoglobin from the taut to the relaxed conformation. D. Acidosis shifts the oxygen-dissociation curve to the left. E. Acidosis decreases the ability of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate to bind to hemoglobin. Correct answer = A. HbS is significantly less soluble in the deoxygenated form, compared with oxyhemoglobin S. Decreased pH (acidosis) causes the oxygen-dissociation curve to shift to the right, indicating decreased oxygen affinity (increased delivery). This favors the formation of the deoxy, or taut, form of hemoglobin and can precipitate a sickle cell crisis. The binding of 2,3bisphosphoglycerate is increased, because it binds only to the deoxy form of hemoglobin."
