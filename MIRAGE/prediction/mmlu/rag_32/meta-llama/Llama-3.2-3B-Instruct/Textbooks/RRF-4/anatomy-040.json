Let's analyze each option given: A. Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that affects the digestive tract, but it is not directly related to esophageal sphincter incompetence. B. Esophageal varices are enlarged veins in the esophagus, typically caused by liver disease, and are not directly related to esophageal sphincter incompetence. C. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing symptoms like heartburn and regurgitation. It is often related to incompetence of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which fails to prevent the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. D. Pyloric stenosis is a narrowing of the pylorus, the passage between the stomach and the small intestine, and is not directly related to esophageal sphincter incompetence.

A deficiency in any one of these manometric characteristics of the sphincter is associated with incompetency of the cardia regardless of whether a hernia is present.

Complications due to repetitive reflux are esophagitis, stricture, and BE; repetitive aspiration may lead to progressive pulmonary fibrosis. The severity of the complications is directly related to the prevalence of a structurally defective sphincter (Table 25-6). The observation that a structurally defective sphincter occurs in 42% of patients without complications (most of whom have one or two components failed) suggests that disease may be confined to the sphincter due to compensation by a vigorously contracting esophageal body. Eventually, all three components of the sphincter fail, allowing unrestricted reflux of gastric juice into the esophagus"

Thus, in the presence of a hiatal hernia, the sphincter resides entirely within the chest cavity and cannot respond to an increase in intra-abdominal pressure because the pinch valve mechanism is lost and gastro-esophageal reflux is more liable to occur.Therefore, a permanently defective sphincter is defined by one or more of the following characteristics: an LES with a mean resting pressure of less than 6 mmHg, an overall sphincter length of <2 cm, and intra-abdominal sphincter length of <1 cm. Compared to normal subjects without GERD these values are below the 2.5 percentile for each parameter. The most com-mon cause of a defective sphincter is an inadequate abdominal length.Once the sphincter is permanently defective, this condi-tion is irreversible, and although esophageal mucosal injury may be healed with antisecretory medication, reflux will continue to occur.

These characteristics include the resting LES pressure, its overall length, and the intra-abdominal length that is exposed to the positive pressure environment of the abdomen (Table 25-5). The resistance to gastroesophageal reflux is a function of both the resting LES pressure and length over which this pressure is exerted. Thus, as the sphincter becomes shorter, a higher pressure will be required in order to prevent a given amount of reflux (Fig. 25-26). Much like the neck of a balloon as it is inflated, as the stomach fills and distends, sphincter length decreases. Therefore, if the over-all length of the sphincter is permanently short from repeated distention of the fundus secondary to large volume meals, then with minimal episodes of gastric distention and pressure, there will be insufficient sphincter length for the barrier to remain"

In normal swallowing, a vagally mediated relaxation of the distal esophageal sphincter and the gastric fundus occurs. The relaxation lasts for approximately 10 seconds and is followed by a rapid recovery to the former tonicity. To ensure relaxation of the sphincter, three factors are important: (a) Only the fundus of the stomach should be used to buttress the sphincter, because it is known to relax in con-cert with the sphincter; (b) the gastric wrap should be properly placed around the sphincter and not incorporate a portion of the stomach or be placed around"

            "content": "the pharyngeal swallow does not initiate a peristaltic con-traction, then the coincident relaxation of the LES is unguarded and reflux of gastric juice can occur. This may be an explanation for the observation of spontaneous lower esophageal relaxation, thought by some to be a causative factor in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The power of the worm-drive pump of the esophageal body is insufficient to force open a valve that does not relax. In dogs, a bilateral cervical parasympathetic blockade abolishes the relaxation of the LES that occurs with pharyngeal swallowing or distention of the esophagus. Conse-quently, vagal function appears to be important in coordinating the relaxation of the LES with esophageal contraction.The antireflux mechanism in human beings is composed of three components: a mechanically effective LES, efficient esophageal clearance, and an adequately functioning gastric reservoir. A defect of any one of these three components can lead to increased"

As the esophageal sphincter becomes shorter, increased pressure is necessary to maintain competence. LES = lower esophageal sphincter.A third characteristic of the LES that impacts its ability to prevent reflux is its position about the diaphragm. It is important that a portion of the total length of the LES be exposed to the effects of an intra-abdominal pressure. That is, during periods of elevated intra-abdominal pressure, the resistance of the barrier would be overcome if pressure were not applied equally to both the LES and stomach simultaneously. Thus, in the presence of a hiatal hernia, the sphincter resides entirely within the chest cavity and cannot respond to an"

Myotomy of the LES may be indicated in patients not responding to medical therapy or dilation. When the symp-tom contribution of the hypertensive sphincter is in doubt, it is possible to inject the LES with botulinum toxin, endoscopically. If symptoms are relieved (temporarily) with this technique, then it is likely that myotomy will provide more permanent benefit.Secondary Esophageal Motility Disorders. Connective tissue disease, particularly scleroderma and the CREST syn-drome, exhibits severe esophageal motility disorders. Addi-tionally, patients treated as infants for esophageal atresia will often develop secondary motility disorders manifest later in life. Symptoms of these disorders are heartburn and dysphagia. The latter may be a result of a peptic stricture rather than the esophageal dysmotility. An"

Fibrosis of the esophagus and cardia can result in weak contractions and failure of the distal esopha-geal sphincter to relax. The loss of esophageal contractions can result in the stasis of food, esophageal dilatation, regurgitation, and aspiration. The presence of these abnormalities signals end-stage motor disease. In these situations, esophageal replace-ment is usually required to establish normal alimentation. Before proceeding with esophageal resection for"

These motility abnormalities have been termed nonspecific esophageal motility disorders. Their significance in the causation of chest pain or dysphagia is still unclear. Surgery plays no role in the treatment of these disorders unless there is an associated diverticulum.A clear distinction between primary esophageal motility disorders and nonspecific esophageal motility disorders is often not possible. Patients diagnosed as having nonspecific esophageal motility abnormalities on repeated studies will occasionally show abnormalities consistent with nutcracker esophagus.
