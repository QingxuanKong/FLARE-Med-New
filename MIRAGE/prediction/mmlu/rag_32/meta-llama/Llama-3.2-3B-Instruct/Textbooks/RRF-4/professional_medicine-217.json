    "question": "A 55-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine physical examination. He is currently taking no medications. His pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 165/95 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. The presence of which of the following mechanisms is most likely to increase this patient's blood pressure further?",

        "A": "Decreased cardiac output",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the relationship between the mechanisms of blood pressure regulation and how they affect blood pressure. The patient's blood pressure is 165/95 mm Hg, which is higher than the normal range. We need to determine which mechanism would increase blood pressure further in this patient. First, let's review the mechanisms that regulate blood pressure: 1. Cardiac output (CO): Increased CO can increase blood pressure. 2. Stroke volume (SV): Increased SV can increase blood pressure. 3. Peripheral resistance (PR): Increased PR can increase blood pressure. 4. Heart rate (HR): Increased HR can increase blood pressure. 5. Vasoconstriction: Increased vasoconstriction can increase blood pressure. Now, let's analyze each option: A. Decreased cardiac output (CO): Decreased CO would decrease blood pressure, not increase it. B. Decreased pulse: Decreased pulse (heart rate) would decrease blood pressure, not increase it. C. Decreased stroke volume (SV): Decreased SV would decrease blood pressure, not increase it. D. Increased peripheral vascular resistance (PR): Increased PR would increase blood pressure. Based on the analysis, the presence of increased peripheral vascular resistance (PR) is the mechanism that would increase the patient's blood pressure further. The final answer is D.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",

His physician initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly used to treat hyper-tension. His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema? What other drugs could be used to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and decrease blood pressure,"

Since homeostatic responses are often significant contributors to the overall response to a drug, these physiologic alterations may change the pattern or intensity of drug response. In the cardiovascular system, the cardiac output increment required by mild or moderate exercise is successfully provided until at least age 75 (in individuals without obvious cardiac disease), but the increase is the result primarily of increased stroke volume in the elderly and not tachycardia, as in young adults. Average blood pressure goes up with age (in most Western countries), but the incidence of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension also increases markedly. It is thus particularly important to check for orthostatic hypotension (>20 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure on standing) on every visit. Similarly, the average 2-hour postprandial blood glucose level increases by about 1 mg/ dL for each year of age above 50."

            "content": "The blood pressure measured in an office or hospital setting may not accurately reflect the pressure in other venues. \u201cWhite coat hypertension\u201d is defined by at least three separate clinic-based measurements >140/90 mmHg and at least two non-clinic-based measurements <140/90 mmHg in the absence of any evidence of target organ damage. Individuals with white coat hypertension may not benefit from drug therapy, although they may be more likely to develop sustained hypertension over time. Masked hypertension should be suspected when normal or even low blood pressures are recorded in patients with advanced atherosclerotic disease, especially when evidence of target organ damage is present or bruits are audible."

            "content": "A 65-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe central chest pain that radiated to the neck and predominantly to the left arm. He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

            "content": "Reliable measurements of blood pressure depend on attention to the details of the technique and conditions of the measurement. Proper training of observers, positioning of the patient, and selection of cuff size are essential. Owing to recent regulations preventing the use of mercury because of concerns about its potential toxicity, most office measurements are made with aneroid sphygmomanometers or with oscillometric devices. These instruments should be calibrated periodically, and their accuracy confirmed. Before the blood pressure measurement is taken, the individual should be seated quietly in a chair (not the exam table) with feet on the floor for 5 min in a private, quiet setting with a comfortable room temperature. At least two measurements should be made. The center of the cuff should be at heart level, and the width of the bladder cuff Duration of hypertension Previous therapies: responses and side effects Family history of hypertension and cardiovascular disease"

            "content": "The physical examination is often normal in patients with stable angina when they are asymptomatic. However, because of the increased likelihood of IHD in patients with diabetes and/or peripheral arterial disease, clinicians should search for evidence of atherosclerotic disease at other sites, such as an abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid arterial bruits, and diminished arterial pulses in the lower extremities. The physical examination also should include a search for evidence of risk factors for atherosclerosis such as xanthelasmas and xanthomas (Chap. 291e). Evidence for peripheral arterial disease should be sought by evaluating the pulse contour at multiple locations and comparing the blood pressure between the arms and between the arms and the legs (ankle-brachial index). Examination of the fundi may reveal an increased light reflex and arteriovenous nicking as evidence of hypertension. There also may be signs of anemia, thyroid disease, and nicotine stains on the fingertips from"

Risk factors include a family history of hypertension or heart disease, a high-sodium diet, smoking, obesity, race (blacks > whites), and advanced age. Hypertension is asymptomatic until complications develop. Patients should be evaluated for end-organ damage to the brain (stroke, dementia), eye (cotton-wool exudates, hemorrhage), heart (LVH), and kidney (proteinuria, chronic kidney disease). Renal bruits may signify renal artery stenosis as the cause of hypertension. Conduct cardiovascular, neurologic, ophthalmologic, and abdominal exams.

The examining physician discovers postural hypotension and moderate vitiligo (depigmented areas of skin) and obtains routine blood tests. She finds hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis and suspects Addison\u2019s disease. She performs a standard ACTH 1\u201324 stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response compatible with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency. The diagnosis of autoimmune Addison\u2019s disease is made, and the patient must start replacement of the hormones he cannot produce himself. How should this patient be treated? What precautions should he take?"
