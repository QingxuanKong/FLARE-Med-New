Next, the thyroid cartilage is palpated, followed by the cricoid cartilage. The cricoid cartilage is located below the thyroid cartilage.

Using a finger to gently feel laryngeal structures in the midline, first find the thyroid notch in the superior margin of the thyroid cartilage and then move the finger inferiorly over the laryngeal prominence and down the anterior surface of the thyroid angle. As the finger crosses the inferior margin of the thyroid cartilage in the midline, a soft depression is felt before the finger slides onto the arch of the cricoid cartilage, which is hard. The soft depression between the lower margin of the thyroid cartilage and the arch of the cricoid is the position of the median cricothyroid ligament. A tube passed through the median cricothyroid ligament enters the airway just inferior to the position of the vocal folds of the larynx."

Some physicians recommend palpating the breast in long strips, but the exact palpation technique used is probably not as important as the thoroughness of its application over the entire breast. One very effective method is to palpate the breast in enlarging concentric circles until the entire breast is covered. A pendulous breast can be palpated by placing one hand between the breast and the chest wall and gently palpating the breast between both examining hands. The axillary and supraclavicular areas should be palpated for enlarged lymph nodes.

For descriptive purposes the neck is divided into anterior and posterior triangles (Fig. 8.161): The boundaries of the anterior triangle are the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the inferior border of the mandible, and the midline of the neck. The boundaries of the posterior triangle are the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the anterior border of the trapezius muscle, and the middle one-third of the clavicle. The fascia of the neck has a number of unique features. The superficial fascia in the neck contains a thin sheet of muscle (the platysma), which begins in the superficial fascia of the thorax, runs upward to attach to the mandible and blend with the muscles on the face, is innervated by the cervical branch of the facial nerve [VII], and is only found in this location."

It is not uncommon for ribs to be broken after minor injuries, including sports injuries. However, rib I, which lies at the base of the neck, is surrounded by muscles and soft tissues that provide it with considerable protection. Therefore a patient with a fracture of the first rib has undoubtedly been subjected to a considerable force, which usually occurs in a deceleration injury. Other injuries should always be sought and the patient should be managed with a high level of concern for deep neck and mediastinal injuries. A resident was asked to carry out a clinical assessment of a patient\u2019s hand. He examined the following:"

In the lower part of the neck, the vagus nerves [X] give off cardiac branches, which continue downward and medially, passing posterior to the subclavian arteries to disappear into the thorax. In the root of the neck, each vagus nerve [X] passes anterior to the subclavian artery and posterior to the subclavian vein as it enters the thorax (Fig. 8.192). The right and left recurrent laryngeal nerves are visible as they originate in (the right recurrent laryngeal nerve), or pass through (the left recurrent laryngeal nerve), the root of the neck."
