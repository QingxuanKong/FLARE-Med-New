The patient is three hours post-procedure, and the catheter is blocked. The question is asking for the solution to complete bladder washout. The options are Solution R, Normal saline, Solution G, and Any of the above. We need to identify the correct solution based on standard practices in urology after transurethral resection of the prostate with irrigation. Solution R is not mentioned in the provided documents, but Solution G is mentioned as a possible irrigant in the context of TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) and is known to be hypotonic, which can cause TUR syndrome if used for bladder washout. Normal saline is also used for irrigation during TURP but is not specifically mentioned as the best choice for bladder washout after the procedure. Therefore, the most appropriate solution for bladder washout, based on the options provided, is Any of the above, as it implies using one of the standard irrigants for bladder washout, such as Normal saline, but also allows for the possibility of using Solution G if necessary. However, given the context of the question and the available information, Normal saline is the most appropriate choice for bladder washout in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The most important protection against urinary tract infection is frequent and complete bladder emptying rather than avoiding the introduction of a foreign body into the bladder.

            "content": "If the patient does not tolerate pain well postoperatively or is extremely anxious, the transurethral insertion of a 16-Fr. catheter after completing surgery is warranted. This catheter may be inserted postoperatively if the patient is unable to void spontaneously on two attempts. Closed-catheter drainage after vaginal hysterectomy usually is not necessary for longer than 24 hours. The catheter is removed without clamping, and there is no need to obtain a urine specimen for culture and sensitivity."

Regular toileting in elderly patients in nursing homes can improve fecal incontinence caused by over\ufb02ow incontinence from fecal impaction. The use of cone-tip colostomy-irrigation catheters is reserved for patients in whom other therapeutic modalities have failed.

Irritative symptoms: Nocturia, daytime frequency, urge incontinence, opening hematuria. On DRE, the prostate is uniformly enlarged with a rubbery texture. If the prostate is hard or has irregular lesions, cancer should be suspected. Conduct a DRE to screen for masses; if findings are suspicious, evaluate for prostate cancer. Obtain a UA and urine culture to rule out infection and hematuria. Measure creatinine levels to rule out obstructive uropathy and renal insufficiency. PSA testing and cystoscopy are not recommended for longitudinal BPH monitoring. Medical therapy includes \u03b1-blockers (e.g., terazosin), which relax smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, as well as 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride), which inhibit the production of dihydrotestosterone."

The benefits of the robotic portion are decreased blood loss during the pelvic dissection (due to the pneumoperi-toneum). However, recent evidence (randomized controlled trials of open vs. robot-assisted radical cystectomy) did not demonstrate any difference in oncologic efficacy or complica-tion rates.Complications of bladder cancer surgery involve bladder perforation during transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, which require catheter drainage for several days if small (com-mon) or open repair if large and intraperitoneal (rare). Cys-tectomy and urinary diversion may result in prolonged ileus, bowel obstruction, intestinal anastomotic leak, urine leak, or rectal injury. A urine leak from the ureteroileal anastomoses is a common cause of ileus, intra-abdominal urinoma, abscess formation, and wound dehiscence. Deep venous thrombosis is common after cystectomy due to the advanced"
