            "content": "The palatine branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery follows the same course as the palatine branch of the ascending palatine artery from the facial artery and may replace the vessel. The greater palatine artery originates from the maxillary artery in the pterygopalatine fossa. It descends into the palatine canal where it gives origin to a small lesser palatine branch, and then continues through the greater palatine foramen onto the inferior surface of the hard palate (Fig. 8.274). The greater palatine artery passes forward on the hard palate and then leaves the palate superiorly through the incisive canal to enter the medial wall of the nasal cavity where it terminates. The greater palatine artery is the major artery of the hard palate. It also supplies palatal gingiva. The lesser palatine branch passes through the lesser palatine foramen just posterior to the greater palatine foramen, and contributes to the vascular supply of the soft palate."

            "content": "The two arms of the U (greater horns) project posteriorly from the lateral ends of the body. The hyoid bone does not articulate directly with any other skeletal elements in the head and neck. The hyoid bone is a highly movable and strong bony anchor for a number of muscles and soft tissue structures in the head and neck. Significantly, it is at the interface between three dynamic compartments: Superiorly, it is attached to the floor of the oral cavity. Inferiorly, it is attached to the larynx. Posteriorly, it is attached to the pharynx (Fig. 8.9B). The soft palate is a soft tissue flap-like structure \u201chinged\u201d to the back of the hard palate (Fig. 8.10A) with a free posterior margin. It can be elevated and depressed by muscles (Fig. 8.10B). The soft palate and associated structures can be clearly seen through an open mouth. The skeletal muscles of the head and neck can be grouped on the basis of function, innervation, and embryological derivation. In the head"

            "content": "The tip of the tongue drains through the mylohyoid muscle into the submental nodes and then into mainly the jugulo-omohyoid node of the deep cervical chain. Salivary glands are glands that open or secrete into the oral cavity. Most are small glands in the submucosa or mucosa of the oral epithelium lining the tongue, palate, cheeks, and lips, and open into the oral cavity directly or via small ducts. In addition to these small glands are much larger glands, which include the paired parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. The parotid gland (see pp. 900\u2013901) on each side is entirely outside the boundaries of the oral cavity in a shallow triangular-shaped trench (Fig. 8.264) formed by: the sternocleidomastoid muscle behind, the ramus of the mandible in front, and superiorly, the base of the trench is formed by the external acoustic meatus and the posterior aspect of the zygomatic arch."

            "content": "When swallowing, the soft palate and parts of the larynx act as valves to ensure proper movement of food from the oral cavity into the esophagus (Fig. 8.16D). The soft palate elevates to open the oropharyngeal isthmus while at the same time sealing off the nasal part of the pharynx from the oral part. This prevents food and fluid from moving upward into the nasopharynx and nasal cavities. The epiglottis of the larynx closes the laryngeal inlet and much of the laryngeal cavity becomes occluded by opposition of the vocal folds and soft tissue folds superior to them. In addition, the larynx is pulled up and forward to facilitate the moving of food and fluid over and around the closed larynx and into the esophagus."
