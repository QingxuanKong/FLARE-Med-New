Her brother and maternal uncle had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and died at the ages of 28 and 17 years, respectively. Genetic analysis was not performed on either relative prior to death. Serum studies show a muscle creatine kinase concentration of 120 U/L (N=22\u2013 198). The patient's 50-year-old mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of this patient's carrier status for this disease?",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the patient's carrier status for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), we need to analyze the family history and the patient's serum creatine kinase concentration. The patient's brother and maternal uncle had DMD, which is an X-linked recessive disorder. This means that the disease is caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene on the X chromosome. Since the patient is a female, she has two X chromosomes. If she is a carrier of the disease, she would have one normal X chromosome with the normal dystrophin gene and one X chromosome with the mutated dystrophin gene. However, if she is not a carrier, she would have two normal X chromosomes with the normal dystrophin gene. The patient's serum creatine kinase concentration is 120 U/L, which is within the normal range (22-198 U/L). This suggests that the patient may not be a carrier of the disease. The patient's mother has a serum creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L, which is elevated. However, this does not necessarily indicate that the mother is a carrier of the disease. The mother's elevated creatine kinase concentration could be due to other factors, such as muscle damage or other medical conditions. Given the patient's normal creatine kinase concentration and the fact that the mother's elevated concentration is not conclusive evidence of carrier status, we can conclude that the patient is not a carrier of the disease based on her serum creatine kinase concentration alone. However, we need to consider the family history of DMD in the patient's brother and maternal uncle. Since the patient's brother and maternal uncle had DMD, it is possible that the patient could be a carrier of the disease. However, the patient's normal creatine kinase concentration and the lack of other symptoms suggest that she is unlikely to be a carrier. Therefore, the most appropriate assessment of the patient's carrier status for DMD is that it is uncertain due to random X inactivation. This means that the patient may or may not be a carrier of the disease, and further testing would be needed to determine her carrier status. The final answer is: {\"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Also, immunostaining of muscle for dystrophin makes possible the differentiation of Duchenne, Becker, the carrier state, and other muscle disorders. An alternative method, developed by Byers and colleagues, uses an ELISA to measure the dystrophin levels in muscle biopsy samples.

The diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy requires Western blot analysis of muscle biopsy samples, demonstrating a reduced amount or abnormal size of dystrophin or mutation analysis of DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes. Genetic testing reveals deletions or duplications of the dystrophin gene in 65% of patients with Becker dystrophy, approximately the same percentage as in Duchenne dystrophy. In both Becker and Duchenne dystrophies, the size of the DNA deletion does not predict clinical severity; however, in ~95% of patients with Becker dystrophy, the DNA deletion does not alter the translational reading frame of messenger RNA. These \u201cin-frame\u201d mutations allow for production of some dystrophin, which accounts for the presence of altered rather than absent dystrophin on Western blot analysis."

The prenatal diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy is readily accomplished by examination for CTG repeats in the amniotic fluid or in a biopsy of chorionic villi. However, it is not possible to predict whether a fetus with an expanded mutation will have congenital myotonic dystrophy or later-onset myotonic dystrophy. Proximal Myotonic Myopathy (DM2, PROMM,"

            "content": "Malignant hyperthermia is a life-threatening syndrome manifested by a rapid increase of body temperature, muscle rigidity, metabolic and respiratory acidosis, hypotension, arrhythmias, and convulsions. Acute episodes are precipitated by exposure to anesthetic agents in patients with a genetic predisposition. Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, central core myopathy, and other myopathies are susceptible, although malignant hyperpyrexia can also occur in children without muscle disease as an autosomal dominant genetic disorder. A family history of unexplained death during anesthesia is often noted. Serum CK levels rise and myoglobinuria can result in tubular necrosis and acute renal failure. Diagnosis of idiopathic malignant hyperthermia is possible with genetic testing or an in vitro muscle contraction test that reveals excessive tonic contracture on exposure to halothane and caffeine. Treatment consists of IV dantrolene, sodium bicarbonate, and cooling."

            "content": "Incest is defined as a sexual relationship between first-degree relatives such as parent-child or brother-sister and is universally illegal. Progeny of such unions carry the highest risk of abnormal outcomes, and older studies reported that up to 40 percent of ofspring were abnormal as a result of recessive and multifactorial disorders (Baird, 1982; Freire-Maia, 1984). Most X-linked diseases are recessive. Common examples include color blindness, hemophilia A and B, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. Males with an X-linked recessive gene are usually afected by the disease it causes, because they lack a second X chromosome to express the normal dominant gene. A male with an X-linked disease cannot have afected sons because they cannot receive his X chromosome. When a woman carries a gene causing an X-linked recessive condition, each of her sons has a 50-percent risk of being afected, and each daughter has a 50-percent chance of being a carrier."

Nevertheless, there are a number of limitations in currently available molecular diagnostics. For example, in Duchenne and Becker dystrophies, two-thirds of patients have deletion or duplication mutations in the dystrophin gene that are easy to detect, while the remainder have point mutations that are much more difficult to find. For patients without identifiable gene defects, the muscle biopsy remains the main diagnostic tool.
