    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the characteristics of X-linked dominant inheritance based on the provided documents. X-linked dominant disorders are caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome, which affects males and females differently due to the presence of two X chromosomes in females and one X chromosome in males. In X-linked dominant disorders, a single copy of the mutant allele is enough to cause the disease, and females are more likely to be affected than males. The key feature of X-linked dominant inheritance is that the disorder is transmitted from affected parents to all of their daughters, but not to their sons. This is because males have only one X chromosome, so they cannot inherit the mutant allele from their fathers. Instead, they receive their Y chromosome from their fathers. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Parental consanguinity - This is not a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance. It is a risk factor for autosomal recessive disorders. B. Male to male transmission - This is not a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance. In fact, males cannot transmit X-linked disorders to their sons. C. Transmission only by females - This is a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance. Affected females can transmit the disorder to all of their daughters, but not to their sons. D. Transmitted by males only to females - This is not a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance. Males cannot transmit X-linked disorders to their sons. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Transmission only by females.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

A son inherits the Y chromosome from his father and one maternal X chromosome. Thus, the characteristic features of X-linked inheritance are (1) the absence of father-to-son transmission, and (2) the fact that all daughters of an affected male are obligate carriers of the mutant allele (Fig. 82-13C). The risk of developing disease due to a mutant X-chromosomal gene differs in the two sexes. Because males have only one X chromosome, they are hemizygous for the mutant allele; thus, they are more likely to develop the mutant phenotype, regardless of whether the mutation is dominant or recessive. A female may be either heterozygous or homozygous for the mutant allele, which may be dominant or recessive.

However, even if the abnormal X chromosome is not widely expressed, the female carrier may still exhibit minor abnormalities. In the latter case, sex-linked inheritance becomes difficult to distinguish from dominant inheritance. Also, sex linkage is deceptive when a disease is lethal to one sex. In contrast to autosomal recessive mutations, the abnormality has more often been one of a basic protein than an enzyme deficiency."

The continuously updated OMIM catalogue lists several thousand of these disorders and provides information about the clinical phenotype, molecular basis, allelic variants, and pertinent animal models (Table 82-1). The mode of inheritance for a given phenotypic trait or disease is determined by pedigree analysis. All affected and unaffected individuals in the family are recorded in a pedigree using standard symbols (Fig. 82-11). The principles of allelic segregation, and the transmission of alleles from parents to children, are illustrated in Fig. 82-12.

Most X-linked diseases are recessive. Common examples include color blindness, hemophilia A and B, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. Males with an X-linked recessive gene are usually afected by the disease it causes, because they lack a second X chromosome to express the normal dominant gene. A male with an X-linked disease cannot have afected sons because they cannot receive his X chromosome.

Because of these variations, it is sometimes challenging to determine the pattern of inheritance. It should be recognized, however, that some individuals acquire a mutated gene from an unaffected parent. De novo germline mutations occur more frequently during later cell divisions in gametogenesis, which explains why siblings are rarely affected. As noted before, new germline mutations occur more frequently in fathers of advanced age. For example, the average age of fathers with new germline mutations that cause Marfan\u2019s syndrome is ~37 years, whereas fathers who transmit the disease by inheritance have an average age of ~30 years."

There are, however, important exceptions to this rule. X-inactivation prevents the expression of most genes on one of the two X chromosomes in every cell of a female. Gene inactivation through genomic imprinting occurs on selected chromosomal regions of autosomes and leads to inheritable preferential expression of one of the parental alleles. It is of pathophysiologic importance in disorders where the transmission of disease is dependent on the sex of the transmitting parent and, thus, plays an important role in the expression of certain genetic disorders.

            "content": "Males and females are likely to be affected equally Rare traits are likely to be associated with parental consanguinity Traits generally involve mutations in genes that code for enzymes (e.g., phenylalanine hydroxylase\u2013deficient in PKU) and are associated with serious illness and shortened life span PKU, Phenylketonuria. Most disorders involving the X chromosome are recessive. With only one copy of the X chromosome, males are more likely to manifest these diseases than females. Each son born to a female carrier of an X-linked recessive trait has a 50% chance of inheriting the trait, but none of this woman\u2019s daughters would be affected (each daughter has a 50% chance of being a carrier). An affected father transmits the mutation to all of his daughters, who are carriers, but not to his sons; having received their father\u2019s Y chromosome, they would not be affected (thus there is no male-to-male transmission) (Tables 47-6, 47-7 and Fig. 47-4).

Similarly, muscular dystrophy syndromes can be caused by mutations in various genes, consistent with the fact that it can be transmitted in an X-linked (Duchenne or Becker), autosomal dominant (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1), or autosomal recessive (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2) manner (Chap. 462e). Mutations in the X-linked DMD gene, which encodes dystrophin, are the most common cause of muscular dystrophy. This feature reflects the large size of the gene as well as the fact that the phenotype is expressed in hemizygous males because they have only a single copy of the X chromosome. Dystrophin is associated with a large protein complex linked to the membrane-associated cytoskeleton in muscle. Mutations in several different components of this protein complex can also cause muscular dystrophy syndromes. Although the phenotypic features of some of these disorders are distinct, the phenotypic spectrum"
