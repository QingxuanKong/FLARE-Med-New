Pregnancy has been complicated by mild asthma treated with inhaled bronchodilators. At the beginning of the second stage of labor, the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -1 station. The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations. After 10 minutes of pushing, there is a prolonged deceleration to 60/min. The patient has the acute onset of shortness of breath, rapidly develops cyanosis, and becomes unresponsive. Her pulse and blood pressure cannot be detected. Immediate resuscitation is started. Five minutes later, there is bleeding from the nose, mouth, and intravenous sites.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 32-year-old woman in active labor at 41 weeks' gestation, with a history of mild asthma treated with inhaled bronchodilators. She is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated, with a reactive fetal heart rate until 10 minutes of pushing, when a prolonged deceleration occurs. Shortly after, she experiences acute onset of shortness of breath, cyanosis, and becomes unresponsive, with uncontrolled bleeding from the nose, mouth, and intravenous sites. These symptoms suggest a severe and acute condition that requires immediate attention. The key details in this scenario are the sudden onset of respiratory distress, cyanosis, and unresponsiveness, followed by uncontrolled bleeding. The patient's history of asthma and the context of labor may suggest a condition related to the delivery process. Given the sudden and severe nature of the symptoms, a diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) should be considered. AFE is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that can occur during or shortly after delivery, often associated with uterine manipulation, fetal distress, or maternal hypoxia. The symptoms described, including sudden respiratory distress, cyanosis, and unresponsiveness, are classic for AFE. The uncontrolled bleeding could be related to the embolism. The other options, while possible in a postpartum setting, do not fit as well with the sudden onset of symptoms in the context of labor and delivery. Myocardial infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage are less likely given the acute onset of symptoms and the specific presentation. Status asthmaticus, while possible given the patient's asthma history, does not account for the sudden progression to unresponsiveness and uncontrolled bleeding. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is amniotic fluid embolism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

In most cases, the onset, nadir, and recovery of the deceleration occur after the beginning, peak, and ending of the contraction, respectively (Fig. 24-13).

            "content": "Spong and associates (1998) analyzed the characteristics of second-stage variable fetal heart rate decelerations in 250 deliveries. hey found that as the total number of decelerations <70 bpm increased, the 5-minute Apgar score decreased. Of other patterns in second-stage labor, Picquard and coworkers (1988) reported that loss of beat-to-beat variability and baseline fetal heart rate < 90 bpm predicted fetal acidemia. Krebs and associates (1981) also found that persistent or progressive baseline bradycardia or baseline tachycardia was associated with lower Apgar scores. Gull and colleagues (1996) observed that abrupt fetal heart rate deceleration to < 100 bpm associated with loss of beat-to-beat variability for 4 minutes or longer was predictive of fetal acidemia. Thus, abnormal baseline heart rate-either bradycardia or tachycardia, absent beat-tobeat variability, or both-in the presence of deep second-stage decelerations is associated with a greater risk for fetal compromise (Fig."

Resistance of the birth canal may rarely cause intracranial trauma. Acker and coworkers (1988) reported that Erb or Duchenne brachial palsy was associated with such labors in a third of cases. Finally, during an unattended birth, the newborn may fall to the floor and be injured, or it may need resuscitation that is not immediately available."

            "content": "The baseline fetal heart rate is the approximate mean rate rounded to increments of 5 bpm during a 10-minute tracing segment. In any 10-minute window, the minimum interpretable baseline duration must be at least 2 minutes. If the baseline fetal heart rate is less than 110 bpm, it is termed bradycardia . If the baseline rate is greater than 160 bpm, it is called tachycardia. The average fetal heart rate is considered the result of tonic balance between accelerator and decelerator influences on pacemaker cells. In this concept, the sympathetic system is the accelerator influence, and the parasympathetic system is the decelerator factor mediated by vagal slowing of heart rate (Dawes, 1985). Heart rate also is under the control of arterial chemoreceptors such that both hypoxia and hypercapnia can modulate rate. More severe and prolonged hypoxia, with a TABLE 24-' .
