The hospitalist is a physician who provides medical care to hospitalized patients and is responsible for their overall care during the hospital stay. However, the hospitalist works under the supervision of the attending physician, who is ultimately responsible for the patient's care. In addition, the ward manager or the head of the department is also responsible for ensuring that the patient receives appropriate care. But, in terms of legal responsibility, the primary care physician, who is the one who referred the patient to the hospital, is ultimately responsible for the patient's care during the hospital stay and discharge. This is because the primary care physician has the overall responsibility for the patient's medical history and is accountable for the patient's care before, during, and after the hospital stay.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

A consequence of this differentiation has been the emergence of new trends, including specialties (e.g., emergency medicine and end-of-life care) and the provision of in-hospital care by hospitalists and intensivists. Most hospitalists are board-certified internists who bear primary responsibility for the care of hospitalized patients and whose work is limited entirely to the hospital setting. The shortened length of hospital stay that is now standard means that most patients receive only acute care while hospitalized; the increased complexities of inpatient medicine make the presence of a generalist with specific training, skills, and experience in the hospital environment extremely beneficial. Intensivists are board-certified physicians who are further"

Since all medical treatments are justified by their expected benefits, the loss of such an expectation justifies the act of withdrawing or withholding such treatment; these two actions are judged to be fundamentally similar.

In addition to the surviving loved ones, it is impor-tant to acknowledge that caregivers also experience grief for the loss of their patients.53,54Aid in DyingFive European countries, Canada, and six U.S. states have legal-ized physician-assisted suicide, medical assistance in dying, or aid-in-dying, in some form, ranging from hospital-based pro-grams to provision of fatal doses of medications for home self-administration.55-57 Medical assistance in dying is a complex ethical and legal issues with divergent opinions among the pub-lic and healthcare providers.58,59 While aid-in-dying laws passed in the United States vary somewhat, these laws essentially all allow physicians to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to men-tally, competent, terminally ill adult patients for the"

Organizations often do not feel the need to devote resources to overhauling their patient safety systems as long as they perceive their existing processes to be adequate. It often takes a high-profile sentinel event to motivate leaders to com-mit the necessary time and resources to improving patient safety within their organization, as exemplified by the Dana-Farber Institute in the aftermath of Betsy Lehman\u2019s death (Case 12-2).Assessing an Organization\u2019s Safety"
