    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of spheno-occipital synchondrosis and its characteristics. Spheno-occipital synchondrosis is a growth plate located between the body of the sphenoid bone and the basilar part of the occipital bone. It is a type of cartilaginous joint that allows for growth and development of the skull during childhood and adolescence. The growth plate is active until the age of 18 years, after which it fuses and the joint becomes a solid bone. This process is influenced by the presence of growth hormone and other hormones, and its activity can be affected by various medical conditions, including acromegaly. Acromegaly is a disorder that causes the body to produce too much growth hormone, leading to excessive growth and development of the bones, including the sphenoid and occipital bones. Therefore, in patients with acromegaly, the spheno-occipital synchondrosis can be reactivated, leading to continued growth and development of the skull. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

In monkeys, visuospatial orientation and the capacity to reach for moving objects in the defective field are preserved (Denny-Brown and Chambers). In humans also, flashing light and moving objects can sometimes be seen in the blind field even without the patient\u2019s full awareness. Weiskrantz and colleagues have referred to these preserved functions as blindisms or blindsight. It is useful as a practical matter to note that the optokinetic responses are usually spared in hemianopic deficits of occipital origin. Many of the complex behavioral defects involving visual function are caused by lesions at the junctions of the occipital and parietal or temporal lobes. They are discussed here with the occipital lobe syndromes for convenience but should be considered as transcending the largely arbitrary boundaries of these three lobes of the brain."

A rare variant of this syndrome takes the form of alexia without agraphia and without hemianopia. A lesion deep in the white matter of the left occipital lobe, at its junction with the parietal lobe, interrupts the projections from the intact (right) visual cortex to the language areas, but spares the geniculocalcarine pathway (Greenblatt).

Bilat-eral coronal synostosis results in a broad, flattened forehead, known as brachycephaly, and is often associated with maxil-lary hypoplasia and proptosis. Unilateral or bilateral lambdoid synostosis results in flattening of the occiput. Occipital flat-tening can result from abnormal suture fusion (synostosis), or from physical remolding of the skull caused by always placing the baby in the supine position for sleep (known as positional plagiocephaly). Placing the baby in the prone position or tilted onto the contralateral side may restore near-normal skull shape in most cases of lambdoid synostosis,"

The bones forming the base of the cranium are mainly parts of the sphenoid, temporal, and occipital bones. The bones forming the facial skeleton are the paired nasal bones, palatine bones, lacrimal bones, zygomatic bones, maxillae and inferior nasal conchae and the unpaired vomer. The mandible is not part of the cranium nor part of the facial skeleton. The anterior view of the skull includes the forehead superiorly, and, inferiorly, the orbits, the nasal region, the part of the face between the orbit and the upper jaw, the upper jaw, and the lower jaw (Fig. 8.18). The forehead consists of the frontal bone, which also forms the superior part of the rim of each orbit (Fig. 8.18)."

The parts of the sphenoid bone that form part of the bony framework of the infratemporal fossa are the lateral plate of the pterygoid process and the greater wing (Fig. 8.136). The greater wing also forms part of the medial wall of the temporal fossa. The greater wings extend one on each side from the body of the sphenoid. They project laterally from the body and curve superiorly. The inferior and lateral surfaces form the roof of the infratemporal fossa and the medial wall of the temporal fossa, respectively."
