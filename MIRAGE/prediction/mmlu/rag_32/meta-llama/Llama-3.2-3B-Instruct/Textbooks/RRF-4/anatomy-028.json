The spleen is a solid organ that is located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen and is highly susceptible to injury from blunt trauma. In fact, the spleen is the most commonly injured abdominal organ in children and adults, and it is often involved in blunt abdominal trauma. This is because the spleen has a relatively thin capsule and is highly vascular, making it prone to rupture and bleeding in the event of a blunt injury. Therefore, when a patient sustains severe blunt trauma to the left upper abdomen, the spleen is the most likely organ to be involved.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The kidneys are the most commonly injured GU organ in trauma, with injuries including renal contusion, laceration, fracture, and pedicle injury. In hemodynamically stable patients, abdominal blunt trauma can be diagnosed with FAST scan (see the 2\u00b0 Survey section), CT scan, and serial abdominal exams. In hemodynamically unstable patients, abdominal blunt trauma should be treated with immediate exploratory laparotomy to look for organ injury or intra-abdominal bleeding.

This probability increased approximately 1% for each 3 minutes in the emergency department.The appropriate priorities in these patients are as follows: (a) control the source of blood loss, (b) perform IV volume resuscitation with blood products in the hypotensive patient, and (c) secure the airway. In trauma, identifying the body cavity har-boring active hemorrhage will help focus operative efforts;"

For example, when an unrestrained driver sustains a frontal impact, the head strikes the windshield, the chest and upper abdomen hit the steering column, and the legs or knees contact the dashboard. The resultant injuries can include facial fractures, cervical spine fractures, injury of the descending thoracic aorta, myocardial contusion, injury to the spleen and liver, and fractures of the pel-vis and lower extremities. When such patients are evaluated, the discovery of one of these injuries should prompt a search for the others. Collisions with side impact also carry the risk of cervical spine and thoracic trauma, diaphragm rupture, and crush injuries of the pelvic ring, but solid organ injury usually is limited to either the liver or spleen based on the direction of impact. However, patients ejected from a vehicle or thrown a significant distance from a motorcycle have the risk of any injury"

Injury to the major arter-ies and veins in the abdomen can be a technical challenge.132-137 Although penetrating trauma indiscriminately affects all blood vessels, blunt trauma most commonly involves renal vasculature and occasionally the abdominal aorta. Patients with a penetrat-ing aortic wound who survive to reach the OR frequently have a contained hematoma within the retroperitoneum. Due to lack of mobility of the abdominal aorta, few injuries are amenable to primary repair. Supraceliac aortic wounds are particularly challenging due to the need for proximal control. Small lateral perforations may be controlled with 4-0 polypropylene suture or a PTFE patch, but end-to-end interposition grafting with a PTFE tube graft is the most common repair. Blunt injuries are"
