    "question": "An investigator is studying the incidence of the common cold among medical students at various time points during the school year. Results show an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among these students during finals week. It is hypothesized that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. Which of the following laboratory findings in these students during examination week is most likely to support this hypothesis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration",
        "B": "Decreased macrophage activity",
        "C": "Increased basophil count",
        "D": "Increased lymphocyte count"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's consider the relationship between stress, immune function, and the common cold. The hypothesis suggests that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making students more susceptible to infection. This implies that the immune system is compromised during this time. Let's examine the options: A. Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration: Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone released in response to stress. It has immunosuppressive effects, which can compromise the immune system. During finals week, students are likely to be under stress, leading to increased cortisol levels. A decrease in cortisol concentration would not support the hypothesis. B. Decreased macrophage activity: Macrophages play a crucial role in the innate immune response, including the phagocytosis of pathogens. Stress can impair macrophage activity, making it harder for the immune system to clear infections. This option supports the hypothesis. C. Increased basophil count: Basophils are a type of white blood cell involved in the inflammatory response, particularly in allergic reactions. While stress can affect basophil counts, there is no clear link between stress and an increase in basophil count that would support the hypothesis. D. Increased lymphocyte count: Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell critical for the adaptive immune response. Stress can have mixed effects on lymphocyte counts, but there is no clear evidence that increased lymphocyte count would make students more susceptible to infection. Considering these points, the laboratory finding that is most likely to support the hypothesis is decreased macrophage activity, as it directly relates to the compromised immune function that would make students more susceptible to infection during finals week.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

            "content": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways that causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and cough, particularly at night and/or early in the morning. The hallmarks of asthma are intermittent, reversible airway obstruction; chronic bronchial inflammation with eosinophils; bronchial smooth muscle cell hypertrophy and hyperreactivity; and increased mucus secretion. Sometimes trivial stimuli are sufficient to trigger attacks in patients, because of airway hyper-reactivity. Many cells play a role in the inflammatory response, in particular eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and epithelial cells. Of note, asthma has increased in incidence significantly in the Western world over the past 4 decades. One explanation for this troubling trend is the hygiene hypothesis, according to which a lack of exposure to infectious organisms (and possibly nonpathogenic microorganisms as well) in early childhood results in defects in"

            "content": "Influenza is most frequently described as a respiratory illness characterized by systemic symptoms, such as headache, feverishness, chills, myalgia, and malaise, as well as accompanying respiratory tract signs and symptoms, particularly cough and sore throat. In some cases, the onset is so abrupt that patients can recall the precise time they became ill. However, the spectrum of clinical presentations is wide, ranging from a mild, afebrile respiratory illness similar to the common cold (with either a gradual or an abrupt onset) to severe prostration with relatively few respiratory signs and symptoms. In most of the cases that come to a physician\u2019s attention, the patient has a fever, with temperatures of 38\u00b0\u201341\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0\u2013105.8\u00b0F). A rapid temperature rise within the first 24 h of illness is generally followed by gradual defervescence over 2\u20133 days, although, on occasion, fever may last as long as 1 week."

            "content": "Of course, any person facing a challenging or threatening task for which he may feel unprepared and inadequate experiences some degree of nervousness and anxiety. Anxiety is then not abnormal, and the alertness and attentiveness that accompany it may actually improve performance up to a point. Barratt and White found that mildly anxious medical students performed better on examinations than those lacking in anxiety. As anxiety increases, so does the standard of performance, but only to a point, after which increasing anxiety causes a rapid decline in performance (Yerkes-Dodson law)."
