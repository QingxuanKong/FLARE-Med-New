Once the defect in HNPCC patients was recognized, the epigenetic silencing or mutation of mismatch repair genes was found in about 15% of the colorectal cancers occurring in people with no inherited predisposing mutation."

            "content": "In contrast to CDH1, patients with FAP who have germ line mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) genes have an increased risk for development of intestinal-type gastric cancer. Sporadic intestinal-type gastric cancer is associated with several genetic abnormalities including acquired mutations of \u03b2-catenin, a protein that binds to both E-cadherin and APC protein; microsatellite instability; and hypermethylation of genes including TGF\u03b2RII, BAX, IGFRII, and p16/INK4a. TP53 mutations are present in a majority of sporadic gastric cancers of both histologic types."

Type II endometrial cancers are estrogen-independent, aggressive, and characterized by nonendometrioid, serous or clear cell, histology, or carcinosarcoma.102 Emerging data, however, suggest that the molecular features could provide reproducible subtypes that have the potential to guide and refine treatment. The most comprehensive molecular study of endometrial cancer to date has been The Cancer Genome Atlas, which included a combination of whole genome sequencing, exome sequencing, microsatellite instability assays, copy number analysis, and proteomics.103 Molecular information was used to classify 232 endometrial cancer patients into four groups: POLE ultramutated, MSI hypermutated, copy number low, and copy number high that correlated with progression-free survival.103 Two practical pared-down classification systems to identify four molecular subgroups with distinct prognostic"
