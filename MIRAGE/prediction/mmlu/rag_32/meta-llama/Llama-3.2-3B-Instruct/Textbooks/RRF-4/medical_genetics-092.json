In the past, the focus of research has been on the frequently mutated genes, but it appears that the large number of genes that are infrequently mutated in cancer are major contributors to the cancer phenotype.

Inactivating mutations are usually recessive, and an affected individual is homozygous or compound heterozygous (e.g., carrying two different mutant alleles of the same gene) for the disease-causing mutations. Alternatively, mutation in a single allele can result in haploinsufficiency, a situation in which one normal allele is not sufficient to maintain a normal phenotype. Haploinsufficiency is a commonly observed mechanism in diseases associated with mutations in transcription factors (Table 82-2).

            "content": "The answer to this question depends on the functional consequences of the mutation. If the mutation has a significantly deleterious effect, it will simply be eliminated by purifying selection and will not become fixed. (In the most extreme case, the individual carrying the mutation will die without producing progeny.) Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population. Because humans reproduce sexually and genetic recombination occurs each time a gamete is formed (discussed in Chapter 5), the genome of each individual who has inherited the mutation will be a unique recombinational mosaic of segments inherited from a large number of ancestors. The selected mutation along with a modest amount of neighboring sequence\u2014ultimately inherited from the individual in which the mutation occurred\u2014will simply be one piece of this huge mosaic."

            "content": "Another surprising group of genetic alterations discovered through tumor genome sequencing studies are mutations in enzymes that participate in the Krebs cycle. Of these, mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) have garnered the most interest, as they have revealed a new mechanism of oncogenesis termed oncometabolism ( Fig. 6.24). The proposed steps in the oncogenic pathway involving IDH are as follows: IDH acquires a mutation that leads to a specific amino acid substitution involving residues in the active site of the enzyme. As a result, the mutated protein loses it ability to function as an isocitrate dehydrogenase and instead acquires a new enzymatic activity that catalyzes the production of 2-hydroxglutarate (2-HG). 2-HG in turn acts as an inhibitor of several other enzymes that are members of the TET family, including TET2."

            "content": "Nevertheless, certain sets of mutations are particularly common in colorectal cancer, and they occur in a characteristic order. Thus, in most cases, mutations inactivating the Apc gene appear to be the first, or at least a very early step, as they are detected at the same high frequency in small benign polyps as in large malignant tumors. Changes that lead to genetic and epigenetic instability are likely also to arise early in tumor progression, since they are needed to drive the later steps. Activating mutations in the K-Ras gene occur later, as they are rare in small polyps but common in larger ones that show disturbances in cell differentiation and histological pattern."
