Currently, the \u201cquad\u201d screen analyzes levels of \u03b1 fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), estriol, and inhibin-A. The values of these analytes are used to adjust the maternal age\u2013predicted risk of a trisomy 21 or trisomy 18 fetus."

            "content": "In general, indications for genetic analysis can be divided into inherited conditions and acquired conditions. Within inherited conditions, genetic testing can be offered at either the prenatal or postnatal stages. It may involve conventional cytogenetics, FISH, molecular diagnostics, or a combination of these techniques. Prenatal genetic analysis should be offered to all patients who are at risk of having cytogenetically abnormal progeny. It can be performed on cells obtained by amniocentesis, on chorionic villus biopsy material, or increasingly in \u201cliquid biopsies\u201d on maternal blood paired with next-generation sequencing. Some important indications are the following: Advanced maternal age (beyond 34 years), which is associated with greater risk of trisomies Confirmed carrier status for a balanced reciprocal trans-location, robertsonian translocation, or inversion (in such cases, the gametes may be unbalanced, so the progeny would be at risk for chromosomal disorders)"

In contrast, predisposition testing predicts a risk for disease that is less than 100%. For example, presymptomatic testing is available for those at risk for Huntington\u2019s disease; whereas, predisposition testing is considered for those at risk for hereditary colon cancer. It is important to note that for the majority of adult-onset disorders, testing is only predictive. Test results cannot reveal with confidence whether, when, or how the disease will manifest itself. For example, not everyone with the apolipoprotein"
