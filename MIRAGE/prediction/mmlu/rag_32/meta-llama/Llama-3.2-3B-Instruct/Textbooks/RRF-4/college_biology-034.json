The 3\u2032-hydroxyl end of each oligonucleotide points toward the target sequence (see Fig. 34.20). These synthetic oligonucleotides function as primers in PCR. 2.

First, how could the information to specify an organism be carried in a chemical form? And second, how could this information be duplicated and copied from generation to generation? The answer to the first question came from the realization that DNA is a linear polymer of four different kinds of monomer, strung out in a defined sequence like the letters of a document written in an alphabetic script. The answer to the second question came from the double-stranded nature of the structure: because each strand of DNA contains a sequence of nucleotides that is exactly complementary to the nucleotide sequence of its partner strand, each strand can act as a template, or mold, for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. In other words, if we designate the two DNA strands as S and S\u02b9, strand 0.34 nm"

The original procedure for this purpose was the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method illustrated in Figure 34.9. In this method, the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to be sequenced is used as the template for DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase (DNA pol). A radiolabeled primer complementary to the 3\u2032-end of the target DNA is added, along with the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTP). The sample is divided into four reaction tubes, and a small amount of one of the four dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (ddNTP) is added to each tube. Because it contains no 3\u2032-hydroxyl group, incorporation of a ddNMP terminates elongation at that point.

A strand of RNA can form base pairs with a strand of DNA, generating a DNA\u2013RNA hybrid double helix if the two nucleotide sequences are complementary. Thus, the same templating principle used for DNA synthesis guides the synthesis of RNA primers. Because an RNA primer contains a properly base-paired nucleotide with a 3\u02b9-OH group at one end, it can be elongated by the DNA polymerase at this end to begin an Okazaki fragment. The synthesis of each Okazaki fragment ends when this DNA polymerase runs into the RNA primer attached to the 5\u02b9 end of the previous fragment. To produce a continuous DNA chain from the many DNA fragments made on the lagging strand, a special DNA repair system acts quickly to erase the old RNA primer and replace it with DNA.

(A) DNA polymerase catalyzes the stepwise addition of a deoxyribonucleotide to the 3\u02b9-OH end of a polynucleotide chain, the growing primer strand that is paired to an existing template strand. The newly synthesized DNA strand therefore polymerizes in the 5\u02b9-to-3\u02b9 direction as shown also in the previous figure. Because each incoming deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate must pair with the template strand to be recognized by the DNA polymerase, this strand determines which of the four possible deoxyribonucleotides (A, C, G, or T) will be added. The reaction is driven by a large, favorable free-energy change, caused by the release of pyrophosphate and its subsequent hydrolysis to two molecules of inorganic phosphate. (B) Structure of DNA polymerase complexed wth DNA (orange), as determined by x-ray crystallography (Movie 5.1). The template DNA strand is the longer strand and the newly synthesized DNA is the shorter. (C) Schematic diagram"

While studying the structure of a small gene that was sequenced during the Human Genome Project, an investigator notices that one strand of the DNA molecule contains 20 A, 25 G, 30 C, and 22 T. How many of each base is found in the complete double-stranded molecule? A. A=40,G =50,C =60,T =44 E. A=42,G =55,C =55,T =42 B. A=44,G =60,C =50,T =40 C. A=45,G =45,C =52,T =52 D. A=50,G =47,C =50,T =47 Correct answer = B. The two DNA strands are complementary to each other, with A base-paired with T and G base-paired with C. So, for example, the 20 A on the first strand would be paired with 20 T on the second strand, the 25 G on the first strand would be paired with 25 C on the second strand, and so forth. When these are all added together, the correct numbers of each base are indicated in choice B. Notice that, in the correct answer, A = T and G = C. 0.4.

A schematic view of the reaction catalyzed by DNA primase, the enzyme that synthesizes the short RNA primers made on the lagging strand using DNA as a template. Unlike DNA polymerase, this enzyme can start a new polynucleotide chain by joining two nucleoside triphosphates together. The primase synthesizes a short polynucleotide in the 5\u02b9-to-3\u02b9 direction and then stops, making the 3\u02b9 end of this primer available for the DNA polymerase. chance to correct these errors by a process called strand-directed mismatch repair. Before discussing this mechanism, however, we describe the other types of proteins that function at the replication fork.

The \u201chairpin helices\u201d shown in the bare, single-strand DNA result from a chance matching of short regions of complementary nucleotide sequence; they are similar to the short helices that typically form in RNA molecules (see Figure 1\u20136)."

A self-correcting DNA polymerase enzyme catalyzes nucleotide polymerization in a 5\u02b9-to-3\u02b9 direction, copying a DNA template strand with remarkable fidelity. Since the two strands of a DNA double helix are antiparallel, this 5\u02b9-to-3\u02b9 DNA synthesis can take place continuously on only one of the strands at a replication fork (the leading strand). On the lagging strand, short DNA fragments must be made by a \u201cbackstitching\u201d process. Because the self-correcting DNA polymerase cannot start a new chain, these lagging-strand DNA fragments are primed by short RNA primer molecules that are subsequently erased and replaced with DNA."

Telomeres Telomeres are complexes of DNA plus proteins (collectively known as shelterin) located at the ends of linear chromosomes. They maintain the structural integrity of the chromosome, preventing attack by nucleases, and allow repair systems to distinguish a true end from a break in dsDNA. In humans, telomeric DNA consists of several thousand tandem repeats of a noncoding hexameric sequence, AGGGTT, base-paired to a complementary region containing C and A. The G-rich strand is longer than its C-rich complement, leaving ssDNA a few hundred nucleotides in length at the 3\u2032end. The single-stranded region is thought to fold back on itself, forming a loop structure that is stabilized by protein. 1."

The shapes and chemical structures of the bases allow hydrogen bonds to form efficiently only between A and T and between g and C, because atoms that are able to form hydrogen bonds (see Panel 2\u20133, pp. 94\u201395) can then be brought close together without distorting the double helix. As indicated, two hydrogen bonds form between A and T, while three form between g and C. The bases can pair in this way only if the two polynucleotide chains that contain them are antiparallel to each other. Figure 4\u20135 The DNA double helix. A space-filling model of 1.5 turns of the DNA double helix. Each turn of DNA is made up of 10.4 nucleotide pairs, and the center-to-center distance between adjacent nucleotide pairs is 0.34 nm. The coiling of the two strands around each other creates two grooves in the double helix: the wider groove is called the major groove, and the smaller the minor groove, as indicated."
