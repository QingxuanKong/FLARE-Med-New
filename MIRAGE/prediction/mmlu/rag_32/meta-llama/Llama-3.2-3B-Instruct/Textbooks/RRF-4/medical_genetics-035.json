Alkaptonuria is mentioned in documents [18] and [20], while albinism is mentioned in documents [4], [11], [16], and [20]. The key phrase to look for is the mode of inheritance. In document [18], it is mentioned that alkaptonuria is an autosomal recessive disorder. In document [4], it is mentioned that albinism can be inherited in an autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked manner. However, the most relevant information is that alkaptonuria is autosomal recessive, and this is the only mode of inheritance mentioned for both alkaptonuria and albinism in the relevant documents. Therefore, the correct answer is related to autosomal recessive inheritance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Among these, the finding of a mutation in a gene called PAX3 in the Waardenburg syndrome in the early 1990s began a flood of other gene defects underlying the many disorders that had been described on clinical grounds over the previous century. The mutations that give rise to some of these diseases, particularly the Usher syndrome, may also cause nonsyndromic congenital deafness. The syndromic forms of genetic deafness have been classified largely on the basis of their associated defects: retinitis pigmentosa, malformations of the external ear; integumentary abnormalities such as hyperkeratosis, hyperplasia or scantiness of eyebrows, albinism, large hyperpigmented or hypopigmented areas, ocular abnormalities such as"

Such single-gene, or monogenic, disorders are often referred to as Mendelian because their pattern of inheritance is easy to track. Moreover, individuals who inherit the causative mutation will exhibit the abnormality irrespective of environmental factors such as diet or exercise. But for many common diseases, the genetic roots are more complex. Instead of a single allele of a single gene, such disorders stem from a combination of contributions from multiple genes. And often, environmental factors have strong influences on the severity of the disorder. For these multigenic conditions, such as diabetes or arthritis, population studies are often helpful in tracking down the genes that increase the risk of getting the disease."

Common to all cases is the presence of a pathogenic mitochondrial DNA abnormality (Riordan-Eva et al), but the defect may occur at one of several sites as discussed in Chap. 36. Thus, Leber optic atrophy has been added to the growing list of mitochondrial diseases. Variants in approximately 20 genes have been detected, together accounting for about half of cases."

            "content": "Wilson\u2019s disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism that may manifest with neurologic, psychiatric, and liver disorders, alone or in combination. It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding a P-type ATPase. The disease was first comprehensively described by the English neurologist Kinnier Wilson at the beginning of the twentieth century, although at around the same time the German physicians Kayser and Fleischer separately noted the characteristic association of corneal pigmentation with hepatic and neurologic features. WD has a worldwide prevalence of approximately 1 in 30,000, with a gene carrier frequency of 1 in 90. About half of WD patients (especially younger patients) manifest with liver abnormalities. The remainder present with neurologic disease (with or without underlying liver abnormalities), and a small proportion have hematologic or psychiatric problems at disease onset."

However, patients with the most common forms of the disorders have mutations in a limited number of genes. This chapter will focus primarily on these more common disorders."

About 65% of human monogenic disorders are autosomal dominant, 25% are autosomal recessive, and 5% are X-linked. Genetic testing is now available for many of these disorders and plays an increasingly important role in clinical medicine (Chap. 84)."
