The question mentions that this event prevents polyspermy. From the provided documents, we know that polyspermy is prevented by the zona reaction, cortical reaction, and acrosomal reaction. However, the question specifically mentions the release of proteolytic enzymes, which is associated with the zona reaction. The cortical reaction involves the release of cortical granules, but it does not involve proteolytic enzymes. The acrosomal reaction is related to the sperm's ability to penetrate the zona pellucida, but it is not directly related to the release of proteolytic enzymes in the oocyte. Therefore, the correct answer is the zona reaction, which involves the release of proteolytic enzymes to prevent polyspermy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

As the fertilizing spermatozoon penetrates the ooplasm, at least three types of postfusion reactions occur to prevent other spermatozoa from entering the secondary oocyte (polyspermy). These events include the following. \u0081 Fast block to polyspermy. A large and long-lasting (up to 1 minute) depolarization of the oolemma creates a transient electrical block to polyspermy. \u0081 Cortical reaction. Changes in the polarity of the oolemma then trigger release of Ca2 from the ooplasmic stores. The Ca2 propagates a cortical reaction wave in which cortical granules move to the surface and fuse with the oolemma, leading to a transient increase in surface area of the ovum and reorganization of the membrane. The contents of the cortical granules are released into the perivitelline space."

The enzymes contained in the cortical granules are released to the outside of the egg upon exocytosis. These enzymes modify both ZP2 and ZP3 of the zona pellucida such that ZP2 can no longer bind acrosomereacted sperm, and ZP3 can no longer bind capacitated acrosome-intact sperm. Thus only one sperm usually enters the egg. Occasionally, more than one sperm does enter the egg. This results in a triploid cell that is unable to develop further.

Both capacitation and the acrosome reaction can be induced in vitro (28,31). Following the acrosome reaction, the sperm binds to and penetrates the zona pellucida (the extracellular coat surrounding the oocyte). This allows the sperm to fuse with the plasma membrane of the oocyte, an event that promotes changes in the oocyte and prevent entry by additional sperm (31). As the first sperm penetrates the zona pellucida, cortical granules are released (the cortical reaction) from the oocyte into the perivitelline space. This stops the oocyte\u2019s zona pellucida from binding new sperm and inhibits penetration by previously bound sperm, further reducing the possibility of polyspermy (33).

This starfish egg was injected with a Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye before it was fertilized. A wave of cytosolic Ca2+ (red), released from the ER, sweeps across the egg from the site of sperm entry (arrow). This Ca2+ wave changes the egg cell surface, preventing the entry of other sperm, and it also initiates embryonic development (Movie 15.5). The initial increase in Ca2+ is thought to be caused by a sperm-specific form of PLC (PLC\u03b6) that the sperm brings into the egg cytoplasm when it fuses with the egg; the PLC\u03b6 cleaves PI(4,5)P2 to produce IP3, which releases Ca2+ from the egg ER. The released Ca2+ stimulates further Ca2+ release from the ER, producing the spreading wave, as we explain in Figure 15\u201331. (Courtesy of Stephen A. Stricker.)"

Ischemia produces necrosis by starving neurons of glucose and oxygen, which in turn results in failure of mitochondria to produce ATP. Without ATP, membrane ion pumps stop functioning and neurons depolarize, allowing intracellular calcium to rise. Cellular depolarization also causes glutamate release from synaptic terminals; excess extracellular glutamate produces neurotoxicity by activating postsynaptic glutamate receptors that increase neuronal calcium influx. Free radicals are produced by degradation of membrane lipids and mitochondrial dysfunction. Free radicals cause catalytic destruction of membranes and likely damage other vital functions of cells.

As the oocyte is released, the ciliated cells in the infundibulum sweep it toward the opening of the uterine tube and thus prevent it from entering the peritoneal cavity. The oocyte is transported along the uterine tube by peristaltic contractions. The mechanisms by which spermatozoa and the oocyte are transported from opposite ends of the uterine tube are not fully understood. Research suggests that both ciliary movements and peristaltic muscular activity are involved in the movements of the oocyte. The movement of the spermatozoa is much too rapid, however, to be accounted for by intrinsic motility. Fertilization usually occurs in the ampulla, near its junction with the isthmus.

With permission from sigma Xi.) contractile ring of actin and myosin flaments in cleavage furrow (A) 0.5 \u00b5m nucleate the assembly of parallel arrays of linear, unbranched actin filaments (discussed in Chapter 16). After anaphase, the overlapping arrays of actin and myosin II filaments contract to generate the force that divides the cytoplasm in two. Once contraction begins, the ring exerts a force large enough to bend a fine glass needle that is inserted in"

            "content": "Excitotoxicity is not a single event but rather a cascade of cell injury. Excitotoxicity causes influx of calcium into cells, and much of the calcium is sequestered in mitochondria rather than in the cytoplasm. Increased cytoplasmic calcium causes metabolic dysfunction and free radical generation; activates protein kinases, phospholipases, nitric oxide synthase, proteases, and endonucleases; and inhibits protein synthesis. Activation of nitric oxide synthase generates nitric oxide (NO\u2022), which can react with superoxide (O\u20222) to generate peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212), which may play a direct role in neuronal injury. Another critical pathway is activation of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, which occurs in response to free radical\u2013mediated DNA damage. Experimentally, mice with knockout mutations of neuronal nitric oxide synthase or poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, or those that overexpress superoxide dismutase, are resistant to focal ischemia."

            "content": "Fig. 44.15 ). In humans it takes several months for a primary follicle to reach the mature preantral stage. Follicular development is associated with an inward movement of the follicle from the outer cortex to the inner cortex, closer to the vasculature of the ovarian medulla. Follicles release angiogenic factors that induce development of one to two arterioles that form a vascular wreath around the follicle. The Gamete During the preantral stage, the oocyte begins to grow and produce cellular and secreted proteins. The oocyte initiates secretion of extracellular matrix glycoproteins called ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3 that form the zona pellucida (see"

Some of the peptides produced in this way, such as the enkephalins (five-amino-acid neuropeptides with morphine-like activity), are undoubtedly too short in their mature forms to be co-translationally transported into the ER lumen or to include the necessary signal for packaging into secretory vesicles. In addition, for secreted hydrolytic enzymes\u2014or any other protein whose activity could be harmful inside the cell that makes it\u2014delaying activation of the protein until it reaches a secretory vesicle, or until after it has been secreted, has a clear advantage: the delay prevents the protein from acting prematurely inside the cell in which it is synthesized. secretory vesicles wait near the plasma Membrane until signaled to release Their contents"

            "content": "As a primordial follicle develops into a growing follicle, changes occur in the oocyte, in the follicle cells, and in the adjacent stroma. Initially, the oocyte enlarges, and the surrounding flattened follicle cells proliferate and become cuboidal. At this stage\u2014that is, when the follicle cells become cuboidal\u2014 the follicle is identified as a primary follicle. As the oocyte grows, it secretes specific proteins that are assembled into an extracellular coat called the zona pellucida. It appears between the oocyte and the adjacent follicle cells (Fig. 23.4). The zonal pellucida in humans is composed of three classes of sulfated acidic zona pellucida (ZP) glycoproteins termed ZP-1 (80 to 120 kilodaltons), ZP-2 (73 kilodaltons), and ZP-3 (59 to 65 kilodaltons). Of the three, the most important is the ZP-3, which functions as the spermatozoa-binding receptor and inducer of the acrosome reaction (see page 841); ZP-2 is believed to act as a secondary spermatozoa-binding protein, and ZP-1 has"
