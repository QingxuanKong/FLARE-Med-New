    "question": "A 43-year-old man with a history of self-mutilation comes to the emergency department because of pain in his right thigh and shaking chills during the past 3 days. He says he intentionally burned his right thigh several times with a cigarette lighter 6 days ago. This morning he soaked his thigh in a tub of hot water and massaged it, after which a large amount of \"greenish fluid\" drained from the wound sites. The patient normally takes lithium carbonate but stopped 3 months ago after he lost his job. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Vital signs are temperature 39.2\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F), pulse 170/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows an edematous right lateral thigh with multiple burn sites with a white exudative appearance. There is erythema surrounding the burn areas with red streaks extending up the thigh. Palpation of the burn sites discloses fluctuance. Results of laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 14 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 19,000/mm3 . In addition to beginning antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the given question: Step 1: The patient has a history of self-mutilation and has intentionally burned his right thigh with a cigarette lighter 6 days ago. This indicates a high risk of infection and potential for severe tissue damage. Step 2: The patient presents with pain, shaking chills, and a large amount of \"greenish fluid\" draining from the wound sites, which suggests the presence of an infection. Step 3: The patient's vital signs show a high temperature, increased pulse rate, and tachypnea, indicating a severe infection. Step 4: The physical examination reveals edema, erythema, and fluctuance around the burn sites, which is consistent with a severe infection. Step 5: Laboratory studies show a high leukocyte count, indicating a significant inflammatory response to the infection. Step 6: Given the severity of the infection and the risk of sepsis, the patient requires immediate attention from a specialist. Step 7: Incision and drainage (A) is the most appropriate next step to drain the infected fluid and reduce the risk of sepsis. Here's the output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of self-mutilation and intentionally burned his right thigh 6 days ago, which increases the risk of infection.

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

However, because profound alterations in homeostasis occur as a consequence of burns per se and because inflammation without infection is a normal component of these injuries, the assessment of these changes is complicated. Alterations in body temperature, for example, are attributable to thermoregulatory dysfunction; tachycardia and hyperventilation accompany the metabolic changes induced by extensive burn injury and are not necessarily indicative of bacterial sepsis.

The infection is characterized by rapid progression of tissue destruction with demonstrable gas in the tissue (Fig. 179-2). Swelling increases, and bullae filled with clear, cloudy, hemorrhagic, or purplish fluid appear. The surrounding skin has a purple hue, which may reflect vascular compromise resulting from the diffusion of bacterial toxins into surrounding tissues.

Intra-arterial calcium gluco-nate infusion provides effective treatment of progressive tissue injury and intense pain.19,20 Patients undergoing intra-arterial therapy need continuous cardiac monitoring. Persistent refrac-tory hypocalcemia with electrocardiac abnormalities may signal the need for emergent excision of the burned areas.21BURN DEPTHBased on the original burn depth classification by Dupuytren in 1832,22 burn wounds are commonly classified as superficial (first-degree), partial-thickness (second-degree), full-thickness (third-degree), and fourth-degree burns, which affect underlying soft tissue. Fifth-degree burns (through muscle to bone) and sixth degree burns (charring bone) were also described although are less common. Partial-thickness burns are classified as either superficial or deep partial-thickness burns by depth of involved dermis."

Early debridement or surgical excision of the wound without closure delays healing. Routine use of antibiotics or dapsone is unnecessary. Patients should be monitored closely for signs of hemolysis, renal failure, and other systemic complications. Widow Spider Bites The black widow spider, common in the southeastern United States, measures \u22641 cm in body length and 5 cm in leg span and is shiny black with a red hourglass marking on the ventral abdomen. Other dangerous Latrodectus species occur elsewhere in temperate and subtropical parts of the world. The bites of the female widow spiders are notorious for their potent neurotoxins."

Deep partial-thickness burns involve damage to the reticular dermis with damage to skin appendages, as well as the dermal plexus blood vessels and nerves. These have decreased sensation and no cap refill and appear pale or white. Blistering may be present. Damage to the skin append-ages and blood supply in the dermal plexus precludes spontane-ous healing without scar. Excision with skin grafting is needed. Third-degree burns involve full-thickness damage through the dermis and are insensate with no blistering. They appear dry, leathery, and even charred.Acute ManagementAdvanced trauma life support guidelines should be followed. After primary survey, circulation to the hand should be assessed. Palpation and Doppler ultrasound should be used to evaluate blood flow within the radial and ulnar arteries, the pal-mar arches, and digital blood flow at the radial and ulnar aspect of each volar"

Past medical history included schizophrenia, for which he required institutional care; treatment had included neuroleptics and intermittent lithium, the latter restarted 6 months before admission. The patient was treated with antibiotics and intubated for several days, with the development of polyuria (3\u20135 L/d), hypernatremia, and acute renal insufficiency; the peak plasma Na+ concentration was 156 meq/L, and peak creatinine was 2.6 mg/dL. Urine osmolality was measured once and reported as 157 mOsm/kg, with a coincident plasma osmolality of 318 mOsm/kg. Lithium was stopped on admission to the ICU. On physical examination, the patient was alert, extubated, and thirsty. Weight was 97.5 kg. Urine output for the previous 24 h had been 3.4 L, with an IV intake of 2 L/d of D5W."

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."
