It is believed that the polymorphism of MHC genes evolved to enable display of and response to any conceivable microbial peptide encountered in the environment. As a result of the polymorphism, a virtually infinite number of combinations of HLA molecules exists in the population. The HLA genes are closely linked on chromosome 6, so they are passed from parent to offspring en bloc and behave like a single locus with respect to their inheritance patterns.

As an example, various alleles at the histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) on chromosome 6p are used to establish haplotypes associated with certain disease states. For example, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, complement deficiency, and hemochromatosis are each associated with specific HLA haplotypes. It is now recognized that these genes lie in close proximity to the HLA locus, which explains why HLA associations were identified even before the disease genes were cloned and localized.

For example, recombination between DR and DQ loci is almost never observed in family studies, and characteristic haplotypes with particular arrays of DR and DQ alleles are found in every population.

As HLA genotyping has become more exact through DNA sequencing, disease associations originally discovered by serotyping have been defined more precisely. For example, the association between type 1 diabetes and the DR3 and DR4 alleles is now known to be due to their tight genetic linkage to DQ\u03b2 alleles that confer susceptibility to the disease. Indeed, susceptibility is most closely associated with polymorphisms at a particular position in the DQ\u03b2 amino acid sequence that affect the peptide-binding cleft of MHC class II (Fig. 15.40).

            "content": "In addition to allelic polymorphism, products of different DQA alleles can, with some limitations, pair with products of different DQB alleles through both cis and trans pairing to create combinatorial complexity and expand the number of expressed class II molecules. Because of the enormous allelic diversity in the general population, most individuals are heterozygous at all of the class I and class II loci. Thus, most individuals express six classic class I molecules (two each of HLA-A, -B, and -C) and many class II molecules\u2014two DP, two to four DR, and multiple DQ (both cis and trans dimers)."

            "content": "As might be predicted from the known function of the class I and class II gene products, almost all of the diseases associated with specific HLA alleles have an immunologic component to their pathogenesis. The recent development of soluble HLA-peptide recombinant molecules as biological probes of T cell function, often in multivalent complexes referred to as \u201cMHC tetramers,\u201d represents an opportunity to use HLA genetic associations to develop biomarkers for detection of early disease progression. However, it should be stressed that even the strong HLA associations with disease (those associations with relative risk of \u226510) implicate normal, rather than defective, alleles. Most individuals who carry these susceptibility genes do not express the associated disease; in this way, the particular HLA gene is permissive for disease but requires other environmental (e.g., the presence of specific antigens) or genetic factors for full penetrance. In each case studied, even in diseases with"

Each of the alleles at these loci encodes a heavy chain (also called an \u03b1 chain) that associates noncovalently with the nonpoly-morphic light chain \u03b22-microglobulin, encoded on chromosome 15. The nomenclature of HLA genes and their products is based on a revised World Health Organization (WHO) nomenclature, in which alleles are given a single designation that indicates locus, allotype, and sequence-based subtype. For example, HLA-A*02:01 indicates subtype 1 of a group of alleles that encode HLA-A2 molecules. Subtypes that differ from each other at the nucleotide but not the amino acid sequence level are designated by an extra numeral (e.g., HLA-B*07:02:01 and HLA-B*07:02:02 are two variants of HLA-B*07:02, both encoding the same HLA-B7 molecule). The nomenclature of class II genes, discussed below, is made more complicated by the fact that both chains of a class II molecule are encoded by closely linked HLA-encoded loci, each of which may be polymorphic, and by the"

The identification of the ~10 million SNPs estimated to occur in the human genome has generated a catalogue of common genetic variants that occur in human beings from distinct ethnic backgrounds (Fig. 82-3). SNPs are the most common type of sequence variation and account for ~90% of all sequence variation. They occur on average every 100 to 300 bases and are the major source of genetic heterogeneity. Remarkably, however, the primary DNA sequence of humans has ~99.9% similarity compared to that of any other human. SNPs that are in close proximity are inherited together (e.g., they are linked) and are referred to as haplotypes(Fig. 82-4). The HapMap describes the nature and location of these SNP haplotypes and how they are distributed among individuals within and among populations. The haplotype map information, referred to as HapMap, is greatly facilitating GWAS designed to elucidate the complex"
