Some variation in the order of examination from physician to physician is understandable, but each examiner over time establishes a consistent pattern. If certain portions are intentionally not performed, these omissions should be stated so that those reading the description at a later time are not left wondering whether an abnormality was not previously detected."

Each eye is tested separately at a distance of 20 ft. Spectacles should be worn if they are required for distance. The letter at the top of the chart subtends 5 min of an arc at a distance of 200 ft (or roughly 60 m). The patient follows rows of letters that can normally be read at lesser distances. Acuity is reported as a nonmathematical fraction that represents the distance at which the patient has read the chart and the distance at which a person with normal vision would be able to read a letter of the same size. Thus, at distance of 20 ft if the patient can read only the top letter on the chart, which would be normally be visible at 200 ft, the acuity is expressed as 20/200 (if the distance is measured in meters, it is 6/60). If the patient\u2019s eyesight is normal, the visual acuity will equal 20/20, or 6/6,"

Like the age of onset and the distinctions between gray and white matter diseases of earlier onset, this scheme facilitates clinical diagnosis. One word of caution: It is a mistake to assume that the diseases in these categories affect one and only one particular part of the nervous system or to assume that they are exclusively neurologic. Once the biochemical and genetic abnormalities are discovered, they are usually found to implicate cells of certain nonneurologic tissues as well; whether or not the effects of such involvement become symptomatic is often a quantitative matter. Also, one encounters mixed neurologic syndromes in which tremor, myoclonus, cerebellar ataxia, seizures, and choreoathetosis are present in various combinations; it is then difficult to decide whether a movement disorder is of one type or another.

Progressive symptoms may evolve suddenly (seizures, stroke); acutely over minutes or hours (epidural hemorrhage); subacutely over days or weeks (brain tumor); or slowly over years (hereditary neuropathies). Static neurologic abnormalities are observed early in life and do not change in character over time (cerebral palsy). Static lesions are often caused by congenital brain abnormalities or prenatal/perinatal brain injury.
