Step 2: Recall the function of each nerve - - Oculomotor nerve (CN III) controls most of the eye movements, including adduction (medial movement). - Trochlear nerve (CN IV) controls the superior oblique muscle, which is responsible for downward and inward movement. - Ophthalmic trigeminal nerve is not directly involved in eye movements. - Abducens nerve (CN VI) controls the lateral rectus muscle, which is responsible for outward movement. Step 3: Determine the nerve responsible for medially directed strabismus - Based on the function of the nerves, the oculomotor nerve (CN III) is the most likely responsible for medially directed strabismus.

If the eye movements are full and the ocular misalignment is equal in all directions of gaze (concomitant deviation), the diagnosis is strabismus. In this condition, which affects about 1% of the population, fusion is disrupted in infancy or early childhood. To avoid diplopia, vision is suppressed from the nonfixating eye. In some children, this leads to impaired vision (amblyopia, or \u201clazy\u201d eye) in the deviated eye."

Inspection of the refractive media and the optic fundi, the testing of pupillary reflexes, color vision, and the plotting of visual fields complete this part of the examination.

After a time, however, the child eliminates the diplopia by suppressing the image from one eye. After another variable period, the suppression becomes permanent, and the individual retains diminished visual acuity in that eye, the result of prolonged disuse (amblyopia ex anopsia), as described in the last portion of Chap. 12. Nonparalytic strabismus may create misleading ocular findings in the neurologic examination.

A useful review of the approach to vertical diplopia is given by Palla and Straumann. Lesions of the sixth nerve result in a paralysis of the abducens muscle and a resultant weakness of lateral or outward movement leading to a crossing of the visual axes. The affected eye deviates medially, that is, in the direction of the opposing muscle. Diplopia is experienced as horizontal separation that is greatest when viewing in the direction of the sixth nerve palsy and in the distance (Fig 13-7A).

As a corollary, if the separation is mainly horizontal, the paresis will be found in one of the horizontally acting recti (a small vertical disparity should be disregarded); if the separation is mainly vertical, the paresis will be found in the vertically acting muscles, and a small horizontal deviation should be disregarded."

True enophthalmos occurs commonly after trauma, from atrophy of retrobulbar fat, or from fracture of the orbital floor. The position of the eyes within the orbits is measured by using a Hertel exophthalmometer, a handheld instrument that records the position of the anterior corneal surface relative to the lateral orbital rim. If this instrument is not available, relative eye position can be judged by bending the patient\u2019s head forward and looking down upon the orbits.

This distinction, in keeping with the general concept of upper and lower motor neuron paralysis, hardly portrays the complexity of the neural mechanisms governing ocular motility. Perhaps more common but not primarily neurologic is a third group of disorders, congenital strabismus, in which there is an imbalance of the yoked muscles of extraocular movement.

If it does not move, the first eye is uncovered and the test is repeated on the second eye. If neither eye moves the eyes are aligned orthotropically. If the eyes are orthotropic in primary gaze but the patient complains of diplopia, the cover test should be performed with the head tilted or turned in whatever direction elicits diplopia. With practice, the examiner can detect an ocular deviation (heterotropia) as small as 1\u20132\u00b0 with the cover test. In a patient with vertical diplopia, a small deviation can be difficult to detect and easy to dismiss. The magnitude of the deviation can be measured by placing a prism in front of the misaligned eye to determine the power required to neutralize the fixation shift evoked by covering the other eye. Temporary press-on plastic Fresnel prisms, prism eyeglasses, or eye muscle surgery can be used to restore binocular"

            "content": "PTOSIS Blepharoptosis This is an abnormal drooping of the eyelid. Unilateral or bilateral ptosis can be congenital, from dysgenesis of the levator palpebrae superioris, or from abnormal insertion of its aponeurosis into the eyelid. Acquired ptosis can develop so gradually that the patient is unaware of the problem. Inspection of old photographs is helpful in dating the onset. A history of prior trauma, eye surgery, contact lens use, diplopia, systemic symptoms (e.g., dysphagia or peripheral muscle weakness), or a family history of ptosis should be sought. Fluctuating ptosis that worsens late in the day is typical of myasthenia gravis. Examination should focus on evidence for proptosis, eyelid masses or deformities, inflammation, pupil inequality, or limitation of motility. The width of the palpebral fissures is measured in primary gaze to determine the degree of ptosis. The ptosis will be underestimated if the patient compensates by lifting the brow with the frontalis muscle."

            "content": "In contrast, persistent exotropic strabismus in a child can be associated with a developmental delay, often as a component of a recognizable mental retardation syndrome, as detailed in Chap. 37, or with ocular pathology. It does, however, frequently occur in neurologically normal children. If mild, intermittent exotropia is initially treated by one of a number of nonsurgical means such as patching and visual exercises to stimulate convergence; surgical correction is reserved for unresponsive cases. Donahue has written an informative review of the subject."

            "content": "Eye movements are tested by asking the patient, with both eyes open, to pursue a small target such as a penlight into the cardinal fields of gaze. Normal ocular versions are smooth, symmetric, full, and maintained in all directions without nystagmus. Saccades, or quick refixation eye movements, are assessed by having the patient look back and forth between two stationary targets. The eyes should move rapidly and accurately in a single jump to their target. Ocular alignment can be judged by holding a penlight directly in front of the patient at about 1 m. If the eyes are straight, the corneal light reflex will be centered in the middle of each pupil. To test eye alignment more precisely, the cover test is useful. The patient is instructed to look at a small fixation target in the distance. One eye is covered suddenly while the second eye is observed. If the second eye shifts to fixate on the target, it was misaligned. If it does not move, the first eye is uncovered and the test is"

            "content": "Loss of function of either the levator palpebrae superioris muscle or the superior tarsal muscle results in a ptosis or drooping of the upper eyelid. The structure of the eyelid is completed by a thin membrane (the conjunctiva), which covers the posterior surface of each eyelid (see Fig. 8.77). This membrane covers the full extent of the posterior surface of each eyelid before reflecting onto the outer surface (sclera) of the eyeball. It attaches to the eyeball at the junction between the sclera and the cornea. With this membrane in place, a conjunctival sac is formed when the eyelids are closed, and the upper and lower extensions of this sac are the superior and inferior conjunctival fornices (Fig. 8.77)."
