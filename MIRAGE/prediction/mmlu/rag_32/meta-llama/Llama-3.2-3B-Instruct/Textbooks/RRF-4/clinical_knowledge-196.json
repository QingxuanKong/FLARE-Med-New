A hypertonic solution is one that has a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell. This is because hypertonic solutions cause water to move out of the cell, leading to cell shrinkage. In contrast, isotonic solutions have the same concentration of solutes as the normal human cell, while hypotonic solutions have a lower concentration of solutes, causing water to move into the cell and leading to cell swelling.

Most cells throughout the body are bathed with isotonic ECF, the composition of which is tightly regulated (see ). However, certain regions within the body are not isotonic (e.g., the medulla of the kidney), and with disorders of water balance, the ECF can become either hypotonic or hypertonic. When this occurs, cells either swell or shrink. Cell swelling or shrinkage can result in cell damage or death, but many cells have mechanisms that limit the degree to which the cell volume changes. These mechanisms are particularly important for neurons, in which swelling within the confined space of the skull can lead to serious neurological damage. In general, when a cell is exposed to nonisotonic ECF, volume-regulatory responses are activated within seconds to minutes to restore cell volume ("

Local experience and an overall assessment of the side effects of each typically dominate practice. Hypertonic saline (concentrations of 3 to 23 percent) has a comparable effect to mannitol in the treatment of raised ICP and has the advantage of avoiding severe dehydration because it increases osmolarity directly rather than through diuresis. The opposite also pertains, namely that patients with poor cardiac output may be subject to congestive heart failure with hypertonic saline in high volumes. Diuretics have been used to mitigate this effect. Either agent can produce a hyperglycemic, hyperosmolar state in diabetics, particularly in the elderly and in those receiving corticosteroids."
