FNA is generally recommended for nodules \\u00b13cm in size, especially if they are solid. CT scans and radionuclide thyroid scans may be used in certain situations, but they are not the initial step in evaluation.

A 33-year-old man was playing cricket for his local Sunday team. As the new bowler pitched the ball short, it bounced higher than he anticipated and hit him on the side of his head. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious, but after about 30 seconds he was helped to his feet and felt otherwise well. It was noted he had some bruising around his temple. He decided not to continue playing and went to watch the match from the side. Over the next hour he became extremely sleepy and was eventually unrousable. He was rushed to hospital. When he was admitted to hospital, the patient\u2019s breathing was shallow and irregular and it was necessary to intubate him. A skull radiograph demonstrated a fracture in the region of the pterion. No other abnormality was demonstrated other than minor soft tissue bruising over the left temporal fossa. A CT scan was performed."

            "content": "Adenoma Hyperthyroidism from a single hyperfunction-ing nodule typically occurs in younger patients who note recent growth of a long-standing nodule along with the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Toxic adenomas are characterized by somatic mutations in the TSH-R gene, although G-protein\u2013stimulating gene (gsp) mutations may occur also.8 Most hyperfunctioning or autonomous thyroid nodules have attained a size of at least 3 cm before hyperthyroidism occurs. Physical examination usu-ally reveals a solitary thyroid nodule without palpable thyroid tissue on the contralateral side. RAI scanning shows a \u201chot\u201d nodule with suppression of the rest of the thyroid gland. These nodules are rarely malignant. Smaller nodules may be man-aged with antithyroid medications and RAI. Larger nodules can require higher doses, which can lead to hypothyroidism. Sur-gery (lobectomy and isthmusectomy) is preferred to treat young patients and those with larger nodules. Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) has been"

            "content": "Because most glands are relatively inaccessible, the physical examination usually focuses on the manifestations of hormone excess or deficiency as well as direct examination of palpable glands, such as the thyroid and gonads. For these reasons, it is important to evaluate patients in the context of their presenting symptoms, review of systems, family and social history, and exposure to medications that may affect the endocrine system. Astute clinical skills are required to detect subtle symptoms and signs suggestive of underlying endocrine disease. For example, a patient with Cushing\u2019s syndrome may manifest specific findings, such as central fat redistribution, striae, and proximal muscle weakness, in addition to features seen commonly in the general population, such as obesity, plethora, hypertension, and glucose intolerance. Similarly, the insidious onset of hypothyroidism\u2014 with mental slowing, fatigue, dry skin, and other features\u2014can be difficult to distinguish from similar,"

He has been generally healthy, is sedentary, drinks several cocktails per day, and does not smoke cigarettes. He has a family history of hypertension, and his father died of a myocardial infarction at age 55. Physical examination is remarkable only for moderate obesity. Total cholesterol is 220, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level is 40 mg/dL. Fasting glucose is 105 mg/dL. Chest X-ray is normal. Electrocardiogram shows left ven-tricular enlargement.

            "content": "Clinical recognition of diseases of the thyroid is important, because most are amenable to medical or surgical management. Such diseases include conditions associated with excessive release of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism), thyroid hormone deficiency (hypothyroidism), and mass lesions of the thyroid. Considered next are the clinical consequences of disturbed thyroid function, followed by an overview of the disorders that generate these problems. Thyrotoxicosis is a hypermetabolic state caused by elevated circulating levels of free T3 and T4. Because it is caused most commonly by hyperfunction of the thyroid gland, thyrotoxicosis often is referred to as hyperthyroidism. In certain conditions, however, the oversupply either is related to excessive release of preformed thyroid hormone (e.g., in thyroiditis) or comes from an extrathyroidal source, rather than a hyperfunctioning gland ("
