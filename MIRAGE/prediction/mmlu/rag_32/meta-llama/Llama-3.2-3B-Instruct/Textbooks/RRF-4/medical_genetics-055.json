The lac repressor is a protein that binds to the operator site in the presence of glucose, preventing the transcription of the lac operon genes. In the absence of glucose, the repressor is inactivated, allowing transcription to proceed. If the repressor is unable to bind to lactose, it will not be inactivated, and transcription will not occur. Therefore, a mutation in the repressor that prevents binding to lactose would result in the repressor remaining bound to the operator site even in the absence of glucose. This would prevent transcription of the lac operon genes under all circumstances, leading to a lack of expression or reduced expression of the lac operon genes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The Lac operon in E. coli, for example, is controlled by both the Lac repressor and the CAP activator that we just discussed. The Lac operon encodes proteins required to import and digest the disaccharide lactose. In the absence of glucose, the bacterium makes cAMP, which activates CAP to switch on genes that allow the cell to utilize alternative sources of carbon\u2014 including lactose. It would be wasteful, however, for CAP to induce expression of the Lac operon if lactose itself were not present. Thus the Lac repressor shuts off the operon in the absence of lactose. This arrangement enables the control region of the Lac operon to integrate two different signals, so that the operon is highly expressed only when two conditions are met: glucose must be absent and lactose must be present (Figure 7\u201315).

When glucose is available, the operon is repressed by the binding of the repressor protein (the product of the lacI gene) to the operator, thus preventing transcription.

To probe the functions of these three sites, you make a series of constructs in which various combinations of operator sites are present. You examine their ability to repress expression of \u03b2-galactosidase, using either tetrameric (wild type) or dimeric (mutant) forms of the Lac repressor. The dimeric form of the repressor can bind to a single operator (with the same affinity as the tetramer) with each monomer binding to half the site. The tetramer, the form normally expressed in cells, can bind to two sites simultaneously.

Operators in bacterial operons Bacterial operons contain an operator, a segment of DNA that regulates the activity of the structural genes of the operon by reversibly binding a protein known as the repressor. If the operator is not bound by the repressor, RNA polymerase (RNA pol) binds the promoter, passes over the operator, and reaches the protein-coding genes that it transcribes to mRNA. If the repressor is bound to the operator, the polymerase is blocked and does not produce mRNA. As long as the repressor is bound to the operator, no mRNA (and, therefore, no proteins) are made. However, when an inducer molecule is present, it binds to the repressor, causing the repressor to change shape so that it no longer binds the operator. When this happens, RNA pol can initiate transcription.

Initial transcript is called heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). hnRNA is then modified and becomes mRNA. The following processes occur in the nucleus: Capping of 5\u2032 end (addition of 7-methylguanosine cap) Polyadenylation of 3\u2032 end (\u2248 200 As) Splicing out of introns Capped, tailed, and spliced transcript is called mRNA. mRNA is transported out of nucleus to be translated in cytosol."

An activator protein binds to its cis-regulatory sequence on the DnA and interacts with the rnA polymerase to help it initiate transcription. without the activator, the promoter fails to initiate transcription efficiently. in bacteria, the binding of the activator to DnA is often controlled by the interaction of a metabolite or other small molecule (red triangle) with the activator protein. the Lac operon works in this manner, as we discuss shortly."

            "content": "start of transcription We now understand exactly how this repression of the tryptophan operon comes about. Within the operon\u2019s promoter is a cis-regulatory sequence that is recognized by a transcription regulator. When this regulator binds to this sequence, it blocks access of RNA polymerase to the promoter, thereby preventing transcription of the operon (and thus production of the tryptophan-producing enzymes). The transcription regulator is known as the tryptophan repressor and its cis-regulatory sequence is called the tryptophan operator. These components are controlled in a simple way: the repressor can bind to DNA only if it has also bound several molecules of tryptophan (Figure 7\u201313)."

            "content": "The tryptophan (trp) operon contains five structural genes that code for enzymes required for the synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan. As with the lac operon, the trp operon is subject to negative control. However, for the repressible trp operon, negative control includes Trp itself binding to a repressor protein and facilitating the binding of the repressor to the operator: Trp is a corepressor. Because repression by Trp is not always complete, the trp operon, unlike the lac operon, is also regulated by a process known as attenuation. With attenuation, transcription is initiated but is terminated well before completion (Fig. 33.6). If Trp is plentiful, transcription initiation that escaped repression by Trp is attenuated (stopped) by the formation of an attenuator, a hairpin (stem-loop) structure in the mRNA similar to that seen in rho-independent termination (see p. 437). [Note: Because transcription and translation are temporally linked in prokaryotes (see p. 454), attenuation"

            "content": "strong negative feedback, such that transcription falls to a very low rate when the concentration of the repressor protein is above some critical value (determined by its affinity for its DNA binding site). The concentration of the protein can then be held close to the critical value, since any circumstance that causes a fall below that value can lead to a steep increase in synthesis, and any that causes a rise above that value will lead to synthesis being switched off. Such adjustments will, however, take time, so that an abrupt change of conditions will cause a disturbance of gene expression that is strong but transient. If there is a delay in the feedback loop, the result may be spontaneous oscillations in the expression of the gene (see Figure 15\u201318). The different types of behavior produced by a feedback loop will depend on the details of the system; for example, how tightly the transcription regulator binds to its cis-regulatory sequence, its rate of synthesis, and its rate of"
