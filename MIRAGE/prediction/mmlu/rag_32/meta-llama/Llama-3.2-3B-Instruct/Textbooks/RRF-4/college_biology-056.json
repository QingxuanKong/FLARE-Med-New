This phase of neural development involves a type of morphogenesis unique to the nervous system, in which axons and dendrites extend along specific routes toward their target cells. A typical neuron sends out one long axon and many dendrites, which are usually shorter. The axon projects to distant target cells to which the neuron will eventually send signals. The dendrites will receive incoming signals from axon terminals of other neurons. Axons and dendrites extend by growth at their tip, where one sees an irregular, spiky enlargement called a growth cone (Figure 21\u201372 and Movie 21.6). The growth cone is both the engine that produces the crawling movement and the steering apparatus that directs the tip along the proper path. Cytoskeletal machinery in the growth cone creates active protrusions, in the form of filopodia and lamellipodia (see Chapter"

            "content": "Eventually, axonal growth cones reach the target region where they must halt and make synapses. These synapses, as a rule, are destined to transmit neural signals in one direction, from axon to target cell. The development of synapses, however, depends on signaling in both directions: signals from the target tissue not only help control which growth cones synapse where (as we discuss shortly), but can also regulate how many of the innervating neurons survive. Many types of vertebrate neurons are produced in excess; up to 50% or more of some of them die soon after they reach their target, even though they appear perfectly normal and healthy up to the time of their death. About half of all the motor neurons that send axons to skeletal muscle, for example, die within a few days after making contact with their target muscle cells. A similar proportion of the sensory neurons that innervate the skin die after their growth cones have arrived there."

In the developing spinal cord of a vertebrate, for example, a large number of neurons send their axonal growth cones ventrally toward the floor plate (the same structure that we encountered earlier as a source of the morphogen Sonic hedgehog\u2014see Figure 21\u201369). The growth cones cross the floor plate and then turn abruptly through a right angle to follow a longitudinal path up toward the brain, parallel to the floor plate but never again crossing it (Figure 21\u201374). The first stage of the journey depends on a concentration gradient of the signal protein Netrin, secreted by the cells of the floor plate: the commissural growth cones sniff their way toward its source."

In the simplest case, a growth cone can take a route that has been pioneered by other neurites, which they follow by contact guidance. As a result, nerve fibers in a mature animal are usually found grouped together in tight parallel bundles (called fascicles or fiber tracts). Such crawling of growth cones along axons is partly mediated by homophilic cell\u2013cell adhesion molecules\u2014 membrane glycoproteins that help a cell displaying them to stick to any other cell that displays the same molecules. As discussed in Chapter 19, many homophilic adhesion molecules fall into one of two main classes: they are members of either the immunoglobulin superfamily, such as N-CAM, or the Ca2+-dependent cadherin family, such as N-cadherin. Members of both families are generally present on the surfaces of growth cones, of axons,"

Two main classes of synapses are found in vertebrates; those made with muscle cells and those made with other neurons. Synapse formation is best understood in the case of the highly specialized connections between motor neurons and skeletal muscle cells\u2014so-called neuromuscular junctions (see Figure 11\u201338). During synapse formation, the axonal growth cone differentiates into a nerve terminal that contains synaptic vesicles filled with the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, while acetylcholine receptors become clustered in the muscle cell plasma membrane at the site of synapse formation. A synaptic cleft separates the preand postsynaptic plasma membranes, and a thin sheet of basal lamina lies in this space between them (Figure 21\u201382)."

This process of synapse elimination depends on active synaptic communication and electrical activity. If synaptic transmission is blocked by a toxin that binds to the acetylcholine receptors in the muscle cell membrane, or if axonal electrical activity is blocked by a toxin that binds to sodium channels in the axon plasma membrane, the muscle cell retains its multiple innervation beyond the normal time of elimination."

Robo3.1 is lost as the growth cones cross the midline; now the growth cones become sensitive to repulsion by Slit and are thereby prevented from crossing back to the other side.

            "content": "Formation of the synapse involves two-way communication between the muscle cell and axonal growth cone: each of them, under the influence of the other, must reorganize the molecules on its side of the junction. The growth cone releases the signal protein Agrin, while the muscle expresses the Agrin receptor LRP4. Agrin binding to LRP4 stimulates association of LRP4 with MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase. LRP4 also serves as a signal in the reverse direction, from the muscle to the axon (Figure 21\u201383). During synapse formation, MuSK and LRP4 cluster in the muscle cell plasma membrane in the general neighborhood of the future synapse. As the growth cone approaches, it recognizes LRP4, which stimulates the differentiation of presynaptic structures in the nerve cell. At the same time, Agrin released from the growth cone binds to LRP4 in the muscle cell; this activates MuSK, and promotes a more focused clustering of acetylcholine receptors in the muscle cell membrane. Through these"

            "content": "Although the cerebral cortex is the most complex structure in the human body, it has a simple beginning\u2014from the anterior neural tube. As in the spinal cord, the cells that form the walls of the tube proliferate, and the neuroepithelium thickens and expands as they divide. On a predictable schedule, the divisions of the neuroepithelial cells begin to produce a succession of cells committed to terminal differentiation as neurons. These future neurons are born close to the lumen (the central cavity) of the tube. From here, they migrate outward, losing attachment to the lumenal surface and crawling outward along neighboring cells that continue to span the full thickness of the neuroepithelium. These latter neuroepithelial cells do double duty, functioning as progenitors of neurons and glia, and as supporters of the epithelial architecture. They become stretched out as radial glial cells, forming a scaffold that continues to span the neuroepithelium even as this grows to an enormous"
