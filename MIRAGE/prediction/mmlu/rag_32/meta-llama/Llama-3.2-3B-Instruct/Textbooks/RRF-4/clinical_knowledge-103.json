A keloid is a type of raised, thick scarring that can occur after injury, and it is distinct from hypertrophic scars. The key characteristics of a keloid include its firmness, size, and location. Keloids can be tender, red, and can project above the surrounding skin. They are more common in certain ethnic groups, such as African Americans, and can occur on areas of tension, like the earlobes or shoulders. Keloids can also be prone to recurrence after treatment. Considering these characteristics, let's evaluate the options provided.\\n\\nOption A, evidence of infection, is not a defining feature of a keloid. Option C, a fine, hairline scar, is more characteristic of hypertrophic scars, which are less raised and do not project above the surrounding skin. Option D, formed if a wound drain is removed too soon, is not a direct cause of keloid formation. This option does not accurately describe the nature of a keloid.\\n\\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is B. a firm mass of scar tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Keloids rarely involute spontaneously, and surgical intervention can lead to recurrence, often with a worse result (Table 9-8).Histologically, both HTSs and keloids demonstrate increased thickness of the epidermis with an absence of rete ridges. There is an abundance of collagen and glycoprotein deposition. Normal skin has distinct collagen bundles, mostly parallel to the epithelial surface, with random connections between bundles by fine fibrillar strands of collagen.

Because the underlying mechanisms causing keloids and HTSs remain unknown, many different modalities of treat-ment have been used without consistent success.121Excision alone of keloids is subject to a high recurrence rate, ranging from 45% to 100%. Inclusion of the dermal advancing edge that characterizes keloids, use of incisions in skin tension lines, and tension-free closure all have been pro-posed to decrease recurrence rates.

            "content": "turnover of the elas-tin and collagen network of the dermis. Long-term exposure to UV radiation increases the activity of lysozyme, thus impairing the natural turnover of these fibers, resulting in a disorganized accumulation of elastin, and an increase in the ratio of type III to type I collagen. This results in loss of firmness and resilience of the skin, leading to wrinkles and an aged appearance.The other major source of radiation injury that a surgeon will likely encounter is from therapeutic radiation. The vari-ous forms of radiation work to destroy the replicative potential of the target cells via damage to the nucleic acid structures in the cell. This is typically used to treat oncologic disease, but it can also be used to treat benign disease like eczema, psoria-sis, and keloid scarring at relatively low exposures. While this goal is accomplished, surrounding tissues are also affected and damaged. The most radiosensitive components of the cutane-ous tissue are the basal"

            "content": "http://ebooksmedicine.net Remodeling of Connective Tissue After the scar is formed, it is remodeled to increase its strength and contract it. Wound strength increases because of cross-linking of collagen and increased size of collagen fibers. In addition, there is a shift of the type of collagen deposited, from type III collagen early in repair to more resilient type I collagen. In well-sutured skin wounds, strength may recover to 70% to 80% of normal skin by 3 months. Wound contraction is initially caused by myofibroblasts and later by cross-linking of collagen fibers."

            "content": "Wound contraction is an important part of the normal healing process. An exaggeration of this process gives rise to contracture and results in deformities of the wound and the surrounding tissues. Contractures are particularly prone to develop on the palms, the soles, and the anterior aspect of the thorax. Contractures are commonly seen after serious burns and can compromise the movement of joints. The term fibrosis is used to denote the excessive deposition of collagen and other ECM components in a tissue. The terms scar and fibrosis may be used interchangeably, but fibrosis most often refers to the abnormal deposition of collagen that occurs in internal organs in chronic diseases. The basic mechanisms of fibrosis are the same as those of scar formation in the skin during tissue repair. Fibrosis is a pathologic process induced by persistent injurious stimuli such as chronic infections and immunologic reactions, and is typically associated with loss of tissue ( Fig."

Risks associated with thyroidectomy includethe use of anesthesia and the possibility that the thyroidremoval will be excessive causing hypothyroidism or that itwill be inadequate resulting in persistent hyperthyroidism.In addition, keloid formation, recurrent laryngeal nervepalsy, and hypoparathyroidism (transient postoperative orpermanent) may occur. Thyroid storm caused by the releaseof large amounts of preformed hormone is a serious but rarecomplication. Even with optimal immediate postoperativeresults, patients may become hypothyroid within 10 years."
