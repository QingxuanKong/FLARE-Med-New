To perform these functions, neurons are often extremely elongated. In humans, for example, a single neuron extending from the spinal cord to a muscle in the foot may be as long as 1 meter.

Does it refer to the physiologic function of a circumscribed group of neurons in the cerebral cortex, indicated clinically by a loss of that function when the neurons in question are destroyed? This is the way in which neurologists have assigned functions to particular areas of the cerebral cortex. However, from what we know of the rich connectivity of all parts of the specialized cortical centers, one must assume that this is only partly the case. Most who ponder this subject believe that the organization of cerebral function is based on discrete networks of closely interconnected afferent and efferent neurons in several regions of the brain. These ensembles must be linked by both regional and more widespread systems of fibers. This is especially apparent in the discussion of the anatomy of complex cognitive properties such as intelligence, as described in Chap. 20. Thus, many basic functions are anchored in one"

If the amount of target tissue is increased\u2014for example, by grafting an extra limb bud onto the side of the embryo\u2014more limb-innervating neurons survive; conversely, if the limb bud is cut off, the same neurons all die (Figure 21\u201381). In this way, although individuals may vary in their bodily proportions, they always retain the right number of motor neurons to innervate all their muscles and the right number of sensory neurons to innervate their body surface.

In the central nervous system, a single neuron can receive inputs from thousands of other neurons, and it can in turn form synapses with many thousands of other cells. Several thousand nerve terminals, for example, make synapses on an average motor neuron in the spinal cord, almost completely covering its cell body and dendrites (Figure 11\u201340). Some of these synapses transmit signals from the brain or spinal cord; others bring sensory information from muscles or from the skin.

Moreover, the response and control mechanisms of each part of a neuron are distinct from those in other parts. This intraneuronal specialization is a consequence of the particular morphology and the ion channel composition of each part of the neuron. For example, dendrites have ligand gated ion channels that allow neurons to respond to chemicals released by other neurons, and their characteristic branching pattern allows for integration of multiple input signals. In contrast the axon typically has a long length and high concentration of voltage-gated channels that allows it to convey electrical signals (action potentials) rapidly over long distances without alteration."

This is accomplished primarily through action potentials, which propagate down the axon to the presynaptic terminals and cause neurotransmitter release, signaling the postsynaptic cells. As already explained, the regenerative nature of action potentials allows them to carry signals regardless of the length of the axon, whereas local signals, such as receptor or synaptic potentials (see ), decay with distance and are therefore not suitable for this purpose. The tradeoff, however, is that the all-or-none nature of action potentials means that their shape and size do not generally convey information in the way gradations of local potentials do. Instead, the variations in the rate or timing of action potentials appear to be used primarily as the \u201ccodes\u201d for transmission of information between neurons."

Neuroglia, or just glia, traditionally have been characterized as supportive cells that sustain neurons both metabolically and physically, isolate individual neurons from each other, and help maintain the internal milieu of the nervous system; however, it is now known that they also have important roles in shaping the flow of activity through the nervous system."

The lower limit of the firing range is, of course, 0 Hz, as neurons cannot fire at negative rates. To avoid this problem, many neurons have spontaneous activity levels. These can be quite high (e.g., some Purkinje cells fire spontaneously at 100 Hz) and let a cell either increase or decrease its activity over a similar range in response to inputs. A second constraining factor is the variability of neuron\u2019s firing rate, which determines the resolution of the neuron\u2019s information coding.

Many tests are of doubtful value or are repetitions of simpler ones and to perform all of them on one patient would be unproductive. The danger with all clinical tests is to regard them as indicators of a particular disease rather than as ways of uncovering disordered functioning of the nervous system. The following approaches are relatively simple and provide the most useful information."

Projection cells are neurons that send their axon to another region and thus are the origins of the various tracts of the nervous system. In contrast, local interneurons have axons that terminate in the same neural structure as their cell of origin and are involved with local computations rather than conveying signals from one region to another. These categories are not exclusive; many neurons have axons that both give off local branches and project to one or more distant regions. \u2022 Fig. 4.7 Lateral view of the human brain showing the left cerebral hemisphere, cerebellum, pons, and medulla.

            "content": "The ultimate generation of a nerve impulse in a postsynaptic neuron (firing) depends on the summation of excitatory and inhibitory impulses reaching that neuron. This allows precise regulation of the reaction of a postsynaptic neuron (or muscle fiber or gland cell). The function of synapses is not simply to transmit impulses in an unchanged manner from one neuron to another. Rather, synapses allow for the processing of neuronal input. Typically, the impulse passing from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic neuron is modified at the synapse by other neurons that, although not in the direct pathway, nevertheless have access to the synapse (see Fig. 12.5). These other neurons may influence the membrane of the presynaptic neuron or the postsynaptic neuron and facilitate or inhibit the transmission of impulses. The firing of impulses in the postsynaptic neuron is caused by the summation of the actions of hundreds of synapses."

The nervous system has other capabilities, so-called integrative or higher functions, that are less directly tied to specific sensory modalities or motor behavior. These functions, in particular, require interactions between different parts of the cerebral cortex, and, as is being increasingly recognized, between the cerebral cortex and other parts of the brain. The neural basis for some of these higher functions is discussed in this chapter. Because these functions (as well as sensory perception and voluntary motor function) are so highly dependent on the cerebral cortex, its basic organization is described first. The Cerebral Cortex"

It has been shown that to stimulate motor cells from the surface, the electric current has to penetrate the cortex to layer V, where these neurons are located, inevitably activating a large number of other cortical neurons. The elegant experiments of Asanuma and of Evarts and his colleagues, who stimulated the depths of the cortex with microelectrodes, demonstrated the existence of discrete zones of efferent neurons that control the contraction of individual muscles; moreover, the continued stimulation of a given efferent zone often facilitated rather than inhibited the contraction of the antagonists. These investigators have also shown that cells in the efferent zone receive afferent impulses from the particular muscle to which the efferent neurons project. When the effects of many stimulations at various depths were correlated with the"
