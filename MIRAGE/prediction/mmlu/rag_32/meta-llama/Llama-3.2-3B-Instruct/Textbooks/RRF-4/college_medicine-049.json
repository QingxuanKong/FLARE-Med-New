The balanced equation for the reaction is: C2H6 + 7O2 -> 2CO2 + 3H2O. We are given 84g of ethane (C2H6), and we want to find the mass of carbon dioxide produced. First, we need to calculate the number of moles of ethane. The molar mass of ethane is 30g/mol (2*12 + 6*1). We can calculate the number of moles of ethane as follows: moles = mass / molar mass = 84g / 30g/mol = 2.8 mol. Next, we can use the balanced equation to find the number of moles of CO2 produced: 1 mole of ethane produces 2 moles of CO2. Therefore, 2.8 mol of ethane will produce 2 * 2.8 = 5.6 mol of CO2. Now, we can calculate the mass of CO2 produced: mass = moles * molar mass = 5.6 mol * 44g/mol (2*12 + 3*16) = 264g.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

CO2, a product of active cellular metabolism, is transported from the tissues via systemic veins to the lungs, where it is expired (Fig. 24.1 ). To enhance uptake and transport of these gases between the lungs and tissues, specialized mechanisms (e.g., binding of O2 and hemoglobin and HCO3 \u2212 transport of CO2) have evolved that enable O2 uptake and CO2 expiration to occur simultaneously. Moreover, these specialized mechanisms facilitate uptake of O2 and expiration of CO2.

A treatment goal for the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) caused by acute bronchitis is to insure appropriate nutrition without increasing the respiratory quotient (RQ), which is the ratio of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced to oxygen consumed, thereby minimizing the production of CO2. Less CO2 is produced from the metabolism of fat (RQ = 0.7) than from the catabolism of carbohydrate (RQ =1.0). Fat contains fewer oxygen atoms. Fat is calorically denser than is carbohydrate.

When the individual breathes 100% O2, all of the N2 in the alveolus is replaced by O2. Thus the PAO2, according to the alveolar air equation ( Eq. 23.13), is calculated as follows: Equation 23.20 PAO2 =[1 0. \u00d7 (Pb \u2212 PH2O)]\u2212 PaCO2 0 8. =[1 0 \u00d7 (760 4 . \u2212 47)]\u2212 40 08"

Together, these phenomena allow the estimation of alveolar oxygen tension, according to the following relationship, known as the alveolar gas equation: The alveolar gas equation also highlights the influences of inspired oxygen fraction (Fi ), barometric pressure (P ), and vapor pressure of water (PH2O = 47 mmHg at 37\u00b0C) in addition to alveolar ventilation (which sets Pa ) in determining Pa . An implication of the alveolar gas equation is that severe arterial hypoxemia rarely occurs as a pure consequence of alveolar hypoventilation at sea level while an individual is breathing air. The potential for alveolar hypoventilation to induce severe hypoxemia with otherwise normal lungs increases as falls with increasing altitude."

The ratio of expired CO2 to O2 uptake is referred to as the respiratory exchange ratio and, under normal conditions, is 0.8 (80 molecules of CO2 to 100 molecules of O2). This ratio is similar at the tissue to blood compartment, where it is referred to as the respiratory quotient. The body has enhanced storage capabilities for CO2, in comparison with O2, and hence PaO2 is much more sensitive to changes in ventilation than is PaCO2. Whereas PaO2 is dependent on several factors, in addition to alveolar ventilation, arterial PaCO2 is solely dependent on alveolar ventilation and CO2 production. There is an inverse relationship between alveolar ventilation and PaCO2. In blood, CO2 is transported in red blood cells primarily as bicarbonate (HCO3 \u2212) but also as dissolved CO2 and as"

These differences in oxygen tension have profound effects on arterial blood gas values. As inspiration begins, ambient air is brought into the nasopharynx and laryngopharynx, where it becomes warmed to body temperature and humidified. Inspired air becomes saturated with water vapor by the time it reaches the glottis. Water vapor exerts a partial pressure and dilutes the total pressure in which the other gases are distributed. Water vapor pressure at body temperature is 47 mm Hg. To calculate the partial pressures of O2 and N2 in a humidified mixture, the water vapor partial pressure must be subtracted from the total barometric pressure. Thus in the conducting airways, which begin in the trachea, the partial pressure of O2 is calculated as follows: Equation 23.10 = . = 150 mm Hg and the partial pressure of N2 is calculated similarly:"
