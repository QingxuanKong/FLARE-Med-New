    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the role of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and its relationship with adult hemoglobin (HbA). Fetal hemoglobin is a type of hemoglobin that is produced during fetal development and is responsible for transporting oxygen from the mother to the fetus. In adults, HbA is the primary form of hemoglobin that transports oxygen. Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin, which means it can bind oxygen more easily. However, the retention of fetal hemoglobin into adulthood is usually not compatible with life and can lead to serious health problems. The question states that an individual is born with a mutation causing her to partially retain fetal hemoglobin into adulthood. This means that she will have a mixture of fetal hemoglobin and adult hemoglobin in her red blood cells. To answer the question, we need to consider how the retention of fetal hemoglobin would affect oxygen binding in the lungs and tissues. Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin, which means it can bind oxygen more easily. This could potentially lead to increased oxygen binding in the tissues. However, we also need to consider the fact that the individual is born with a mutation that allows her to partially retain fetal hemoglobin into adulthood. This suggests that her body may have adapted to the presence of fetal hemoglobin in some way. As a result, the increased oxygen binding in the tissues may be offset by some mechanism that prevents the fetal hemoglobin from causing harm. Nevertheless, the increased oxygen binding in the tissues is the most likely effect of retaining fetal hemoglobin into adulthood. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Structural hemoglobinopathies occur when mutations alter the amino acid sequence of a globin chain, altering the physiologic properties of the variant hemoglobins and producing the characteristic clinical abnormalities. The most clinically relevant variant hemoglobins polymerize abnormally, as in sickle cell anemia, or exhibit altered solubility or oxygen-binding affinity. Thalassemia syndromes arise from mutations that impair production or translation of globin mRNA, leading to deficient globin chain biosynthesis. Clinical abnormalities are attributable to the inadequate supply of hemoglobin and the imbalances in the production of individual globin chains, leading to premature destruction of erythroblasts and RBC.

In essence, allelic heterogeneity reflects the fact that many different mutations are capable of altering protein structure and function. For this reason, maps of inactivating mutations in genes usually show a near-random distribution. Exceptions include (1) a founder effect, in which a particular mutation that does not affect reproductive capacity can be traced to a single individual; (2) \u201chot spots\u201d for mutations, in which the nature of the DNA sequence predisposes to a recurring mutation; and (3) localization of mutations to certain domains that are particularly critical for protein function. Allelic heterogeneity creates a practical problem for genetic testing because one must often examine the entire genetic locus"

            "content": "After birth, hemoglobin levels increase transiently at 6 to 12 hours, then decline to 11 to 12 g/dL at 3 to 6 months. A premature infant (<32 weeks\u2019 gestational age) has a lower hemoglobin concentration and a more rapid postnatal decline of hemoglobin level, which achieves a nadir 1 to 2 months after birth. Fetal and neonatal RBCs have a shorter life span (70 to 90 days) and a higher mean corpuscular volume (110 to 120 fL) than adult cells. In the fetus, hemoglobin synthesis in the last two trimesters of pregnancy produces fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin F), composed of two alpha chains and two gamma chains. Immediately before term, the infant begins to synthesize beta-hemoglobin chains; the term infant should have some adult hemoglobin (two alpha chains and two beta chains). Fetal hemoglobin represents 60% to 90% of hemoglobin at term birth. The levels decline to adult levels of less than 5% by 4 months of age."

            "content": "Persons with \u03b1 thalassemia trait may exhibit mild hypochromia and microcytosis usually without anemia. HbA2 and HbF levels are normal. Affected individuals usually require only genetic counseling. HbH disease resembles \u03b2 thalassemia intermedia, with the added complication that the HbH molecule behaves like moderately unstable hemoglobin. Patients with HbH disease should undergo splenectomy if excessive anemia or a transfusion requirement develops. Oxidative drugs should be avoided. Iron overload leading to death can occur in more severely affected patients. Antenatal diagnosis of thalassemia syndromes is now widely available. DNA diagnosis is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of fetal DNA, obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus biopsy followed by hybridization to allele-specific oligonucleotide probes or direct DNA sequencing. Thalassemic structural variants are characterized by both defective synthesis and abnormal structure."

            "content": "2. \u03b1-Thalassemias: In these disorders, synthesis of \u03b1-globin chains is decreased or absent, typically as a result of deletional mutations. Because each individual\u2019s genome contains four copies of the \u03b1-globin gene (two on each chromosome 16), there are several levels of \u03b1-globin chain deficiencies (Fig. 3.24). If one of the four genes is defective, the individual is termed a \u201csilent\u201d carrier of \u03b1-thalassemia, because no physical manifestations of the disease occur. If two \u03b1-globin genes are defective, the individual is designated as having \u03b1-thalassemia trait. If three \u03b1-globin genes are defective, the individual has hemoglobin H (\u03b24) disease, a hemolytic anemia of variable severity. If all four \u03b1-globin genes are defective, hemoglobin Bart (\u03b34) disease with hydrops fetalis and fetal death results, because \u03b1-globin chains are required for the synthesis of HbF. [Note: Heterozygote advantage against malaria is seen in both \u03b1-and \u03b2-thalassemias.] V. CHAPTER SUMMARY"

On the left is shown the pedigree of an affected individual who has inherited the abnormal (Rb) allele from her affected mother. The normal allele is shown as a (+). The four chromosomes of her two parents are drawn to indicate their origin. Flanking the retinoblastoma locus are microsatellite markers (A and B) also analyzed in this family. Markers A3 and B3 are on the chromosome carrying the retinoblastoma disease gene. Tumor formation results when the normal allele, which this patient inherited from her father, is inactivated. On the right are shown four possible ways in which this could occur. In each case, the resulting chromosome 13 arrangement is shown, as well as the results of PCR typing using the microsatellite markers comparing normal tissue (N) with tumor tissue (T). Note that in the first three situations, the normal allele (B1) has been lost in the"
