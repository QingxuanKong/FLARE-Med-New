They point out that in primitive peoples, language consisted of gestures and the utterance of simple sounds expressing emotion and that, over periods of time, movements and sounds became the conventional signs and verbal symbols of objects. Later these sounds came to designate the abstract qualities of objects. Historically, signs and spoken language were the first means of human communication; graphic records appeared much later. Native Americans, for instance, never reached the level of syllabic written language. Writing commenced as pictorial representation and only much later in human evolution were alphabets devised. The reading and writing of words are comparatively late achievements. For further details concerning communicative and cognitive abilities and methods of assessment, the reader may consult the monograph by Minifie and Lloyd."

White men had a life expectancy 2 years lower than that for white women, and black Americans had a life expectancy 14 years lower than did white Americans in 1900.

He concluded that the disease was most likely spread in the water, although he could find nothing suspicious-looking in it. His conclusion ran counter to the then-current belief that cholera was from \u201cmiasmas\u201d in bad air. Very few believed his theory during the next 50 years, with the \u201cbad air\u201d theory persisting until at least 1901. What do you suppose Snow saw in the data that led him to his conclusion?
