She had been having regular contractions every 4 minutes, but now has only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours. **Step 2: Analyze the patient's physical examination results** The patient's examination shows no reason for obstructed labor, the fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated. **Step 3: Evaluate the patient's labor progress** The patient's labor progress is not consistent with normal labor, as she had regular contractions every 4 minutes, but now has only a few intermittent, weak contractions. **Step 4: Consider the possible causes** Based on the patient's symptoms and examination results, the possible causes of her condition can be evaluated: * Braxton Hicks contractions (A): unlikely, as Braxton Hicks contractions are typically irregular and not as intense as the patient's previous contractions. * Lower uterine retraction ring (B): possible, as the patient's cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated, and she has had a decrease in uterine contractions. * Hypotonic uterine dysfunction (C): unlikely, as the patient's cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated, indicating effective uterine contractions. * Primary dysfunctional labor (D): unlikely, as the patient's cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated, indicating effective labor progress. **Step 5: Choose the most likely diagnosis** Based on the analysis, the most likely diagnosis is lower uterine retraction ring (B). **JSON output:** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's condition is characterized by a decrease in uterine contractions, but her cervix is still 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated. This suggests that the patient is experiencing a lower uterine retraction ring, which is a condition where the uterus contracts too weakly to progress labor.

Inefective labor is suspected when the cervix does not dilate within approximately 2 hours of admission. Amniotomy is then performed, and labor progress determined at the next 2-hour evaluation. In women whose labors do not progress, an intrauterine pressure catheter is placed to assess uterine function. Hypotonic contractions and no cervical dilation after an additional 2 to 3 hours result in stimulation of labor using the high-dose oxytocin regimen described in Chapter 26 (p. 509).

Their overall cesarean delivery rate was 5 percent in the 1970s and 1980s with such management. The approach is now referred to as active management of labor. Two of its components-amniotomy and oxytocinhave been widely used, especially in English-speaking countries outside the United States. With this protocol, labor is diagnosed when painful contractions are accompanied by complete cervical efacement, bloody \"show,\" or ruptured membranes. Women with such indings are committed to delivery within 12 hours. Pelvic examination is performed each hour for the next 3 hours, and thereafter at 2-hour intervals. When dilation has not increased by at least 1 cm/hr, amniotomy is performed. Progress is again assessed at 2 hours, and high-dose oxytocin infusion, described in Chapter 26 (p. 509),"

Indeed, rates of cervical dilation ranged from a minimum of 1.2 up to 6.8 cm/hr. Friedman (1972) also found that multiparas progress somewhat faster in active-phase labor, with a minimum normal rate of 1.5 cm/hr. His analysis of active-phase labor concomitantly describes rates of fetal descent and cervical dilation (see Fig. 22-18).

Uterine activity alone can be misleading because of Braxton Hicks contractions. These irregular, nonrhythmical contractions can cause considerable confusion in the diagnosis of true labor. Not infrequently, women who deliver before term have uterine activity that is attributed to Braxton Hicks contractions that prompt an incorrect diagnosis of false labor. Accordingly, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2016b) defines preterm labor to be regular contractions before 37 weeks that are associated with cervical change. In addition to contractions, pelvic pressure, menstrual-like cramps, watery vaginal discharge, and lower back pain have been empirically associated with impending preterm birth. Such complaints are thought by some to be common in normal pregnancy and are therefore often minimized by patients and obstetrical care providers."

Occasionally, a woman may not employ her expulsive forces to good advantage and coaching is desirable. Her legs should be half-flexed so that she can push with them against the mattress. When the next uterine contraction begins, she is instructed to exert downward pressure as though she were straining at stool. A woman is not encouraged to push beyond the completion of each contraction. Instead, she and her fetus are allowed to rest and recover. During this period of actively bearing down, the fetal heart rate auscultated during the contraction is likely to be slow but should recover to normal range before the next expulsive efort. Fetal and obstetrical outcomes appear to be unafected whether pushing is coached or uncoached during second-stage labor (Bloom, 2006; Tuuli, 2012).

            "content": "Mechanism of Labor Spontaneous delivery of a fully developed newborn is impossible with a persistent transverse lie. After rupture of the membranes, if labor continues, the fetal shoulder is forced into the pelvis, and the corresponding arm frequently prolapses (Fig. 23-10). After some descent, the shoulder is arrested by the margins of the pelvic inlet. As labor continues, the shoulder is impacted irmly in the upper part of the pelvis. he uterus then contracts vigorously in an unsuccessful attempt to overcome the obstacle. With time, a retraction ring rises increasingly higher and becomes more marked. With this neglected transverse lie, the uterus will eventually rupture. Even without this complication, morbidity is increased because of the frequent association"

When analyzed against the general obstetrical population, women sent home had a similar rate of birth before 34 weeks-2 versus 1 percent. However, these women did have significantly higher rates of birth between 34 and 36 weeks-5 percent compared with 2 percent. Women with cervical dilation of 1 em at discharge were signiicantly more likely to deliver before 34 weeks compared with women without cervical dilation-5 percent versus 1 percent. Importantly, almost 90 percent of the I-em group delivered within 21 days of the initial presentation."

During active labor, the anatomical uterine divisions that were initiated in phase 2 ofparturition become increasingly evident (Figs. 21-11 and 21-12). By abdominal palpation, even before membrane rupture, the two segments can sometimes be diferentiated. he upper segment is firm during contractions, whereas the lower segment is softer, distended, and more passive. This mechanism is imperative because if the entire myometrium, including the lower uterine segment and cervix, were to contract simultaneously and with equal intensity, the net expulsive force would markedly decline. hus, the upper segment contracts, retracts, and expels the fetus.

But, the term originated at a time when the main indication for cesarean delivery was overt pelvic contracture due to rickets (0lah, 1994). Such absolute disproportion is now rare, and most cases result from malposition of the fetal head within the pelvis (asynclitism) or from inefective uterine contractions. True disproportion is a tenuous diagnosis because many women who undergo cesarean delivery for this reason subsequently deliver even larger newborns vaginally in subsequent pregnancies. A second phrase, ailure to progress in either spontaneous or stimulated labor, has become an increasingly popular description of inefectual labor. his term reflects lack of progressive cervical dilation or lack of fetal"

However, if severe, the condition is a common reason for cepha lopelvic disproportion even with an otherwise normal-sized pelvis. Successive fetal head shiting from posterior to anterior asynclitism aids descent. This movement is the first reqUISIte for birth of the newborn. In nulliparas, engagement may take place before the onset oflabor, and further descent may not follow until the onset of the second stage. In multiparas, descent usually begins with engagement. Descent is brought about by one or more of four forces: (1) pressure of the amnionic fluid, (2) direct pressure of the fundus upon the breech with contractions, (3) bearing-down eforts of maternal abdominal muscles, and (4) extension and straightening of the fetal body. 1.Head floating, before engagement 5.Complete extension 2.Engagement, descent, flexion 6.Restitution (external rotation) 3.Further descent, internal rotation 7.Delivery of anterior shoulder"
