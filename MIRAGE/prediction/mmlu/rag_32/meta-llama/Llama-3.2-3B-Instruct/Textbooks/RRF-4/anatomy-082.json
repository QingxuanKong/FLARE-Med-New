It occurs because the arachnoid mater clings to the inner surface of the dura mater and does not follow the contour of the brain, while the pia mater, being against the surface of the brain, closely follows the grooves and fissures on the surface of the brain. The narrow subarachnoid space is therefore created between these two membranes (Fig. 8.35). The subarachnoid space surrounds the brain and spinal cord and in certain locations it enlarges into expanded areas (subarachnoid cisterns). It contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood vessels. Cerebrospinal fluid is produced by the choroid plexus, primarily in the ventricles of the brain. It is a clear, colorless, cell-free fluid that circulates through the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain and spinal cord."

As it is produced it passes from the lateral ventricles through the interventricular foramina (the foramina of Monro) to enter the third ventricle.

Movement of large molecules and highly charged ions from blood into the brain and spinal cord is severely restricted. The restriction is at least partly due to the barrier action of the capillary endothelial cells of the CNS and the tight junctions between them. Astrocytes may also help limit the movement of certain substances. For example, astrocytes can take up potassium ions and thus regulate [K+] in the extracellular space.

            "content": "Hydranencephaly, defined as hydrocephalus and destruction or failure of development of parts of the cerebrum, is often associated with enlargement of the skull. When the cranium is transilluminated with a strong flashlight in a darkened room, the fluid-filled region of the cranium glows like a jack-o\u2019-lantern. It can be caused by cerebral infarction from intrauterine vascular occlusion or by diseases such as toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus (CMV), which destroy parts of each cerebral hemisphere. The lack of brain tissue reduces resistance to intraventricular pressure, permitting great enlargement of both lateral ventricles; it is especially marked if there is an added hydrocephalic state because of interference with cerebrospinal fluid circulation. This type of destruction of the cerebral mantle in the embryonal period may lead to the formation of large brain defects with apposition of ventricular and pial surfaces (porencephaly) and subsequent failure of development of that part of"

            "content": "The outcome of patients with head injury depends on how the secondary injury is managed. Even with a severe primary injury, patients may recover to lead a normal life. In the clinic The skull is a closed bony compartment, and the brain and cerebrospinal fluid are maintained physiologically within a narrow intracranial pressure range. Any new space-occupying lesion, such as a hematoma, an injury that leads to brain swelling, or a brain tumor, can increase intracranial pressure and compress the brain. In severe cases, the brain may be squeezed down into the foramen magnum, giving it a cone shape, termed cerebral herniation, or \u201cconing.\u201d This may in turn compress the brainstem and upper cervical spinal cord, which can be fatal."
