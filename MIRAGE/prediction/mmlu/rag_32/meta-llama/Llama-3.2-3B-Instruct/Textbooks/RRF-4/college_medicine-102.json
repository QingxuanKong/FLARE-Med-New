For most recreational diving, the respired gas is air. Pure oxygen is rarely used because oxygen may provoke seizures above an inspired PO2 of 162 kPa (1.6 ATA) in aquatic environments, limiting the practical safe depth to 6 m. This is a conspicuously lower PO2 than routinely used for hyperbaric therapy, reflecting a higher risk of both seizures and pulmonary toxicity during immersion. For the same reason, very deep diving requires the use of oxygen fractions lower than in air (FO2 0.21). This is because breathing air at 66 m means inspiring 1.6 ATA of oxygen, the maximum allowable pressure. To dive any deeper, breathing gases must contain less oxygen than air. Deep-diving gases often include helium instead of nitrogen to reduce both the narcotic effect and high gas density that result from breathing nitrogen at high pressures."

This S-shaped oxygen equilibrium curve (Fig. 127-2), along which substantial amounts of oxygen loading and unloading can occur over a narrow range of oxygen tensions, is physiologically more useful than the high-affinity hyperbolic curve of individual monomers. Oxygen affinity is modulated by several factors. The Bohr effect is the ability of hemoglobin to deliver more oxygen to tissues at low pH. It arises from the stabilizing action of protons on deoxyhemoglobin, which binds protons more readily than oxyhemoglobin because the latter is a weaker acid (Fig. 127-2). Thus, hemoglobin has a lower oxygen affinity at low pH. The major small molecule that alters oxygen affinity in humans is 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG; formerly 2,3DPG), which lowers oxygen affinity when bound to hemoglobin. HbA has a reasonably high affinity for 2,3-BPG. HbF does not bind 2,3BPG, so"

Inspired air becomes saturated with water vapor by the time it reaches the glottis. Water vapor exerts a partial pressure and dilutes the total pressure in which the other gases are distributed. Water vapor pressure at body temperature is 47 mm Hg.

            "content": "When the inspired air reaches the alveolus, O2 is transported across the alveolar membrane into the capillary bed, and CO2 moves from the capillary bed into the alveolus. The process by which this occurs is described in . At the end of inspiration and with the glottis open, the total pressure in the alveolus is atmospheric; thus, the partial pressures of the gases in the alveolus must equal the total pressure, which in this case is atmospheric. The composition of the gas mixture, however, is changed and can be described as follows:"

            "content": "Ventilation, Perfusion, and Ventilation/ Perfusion Relationships Upon completion of this chapter, the student should be able to answer the following questions: 1. Define two types of dead space ventilation, and describe how dead space ventilation changes with tidal volume. 2. Describe the composition of gas in ambient air, the trachea, and the alveolus, and understand how this composition changes with changes in oxygen fraction and barometric pressure. 3. Use the alveolar air equation to calculate the alveolar-arterial difference for oxygen (AaDO2). 4. Understand the alveolar carbon dioxide equation and identify how it changes with alterations in alveolar ventilation. 5. Compare the distribution of pulmonary blood flow to the distribution of ventilation. 6. List and define the four categories of hypoxia and the six causes of hypoxic hypoxia. 7. Distinguish the causes of hypoxic hypoxia on the basis of the response to 100% O2. 8. Describe the two causes of hypercapnia."

            "content": "R is usually around 0.85, and more oxygen is absorbed than CO2 is excreted. Together, these phenomena allow the estimation of alveolar oxygen tension, according to the following relationship, known as the alveolar gas equation: The alveolar gas equation also highlights the influences of inspired oxygen fraction (Fi ), barometric pressure (P ), and vapor pressure of water (PH2O = 47 mmHg at 37\u00b0C) in addition to alveolar ventilation (which sets Pa ) in determining Pa . An implication of the alveolar gas equation is that severe arterial hypoxemia rarely occurs as a pure consequence of alveolar hypoventilation at sea level while an individual is breathing air. The potential for alveolar hypoventilation to induce severe hypoxemia with otherwise normal lungs increases as falls with increasing altitude."

            "content": "Most diving is undertaken using a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba) consisting of one or more cylinders of compressed gas connected to a pressure-reducing regulator and a demand valve activated by inspiratory effort. Some divers use \u201crebreathers,\u201d which are scuba devices that are closed or semiclosed circle systems with a carbon dioxide scrubber and a system designed to maintain a safe inspired PO2. Exhaled gas is recycled, and gas consumption is limited to little more than the oxygen metabolized by the diver. Rebreathers are therefore popular for deep dives where expensive helium is included in the respired mix (see below). Occupational divers frequently use \u201csurface supply\u201d equipment where gas, along with other utilities such as communications and power, is supplied via an umbilical from the surface."

            "content": "Boyle\u2019s law is used in the measurement of lung volumes (see Fig. 21.4 ). Dalton\u2019s law is that the partial pressure of a gas in a gas mixture is the pressure that the gas would exert if it occupied the total volume of the mixture in the absence of the other components. Eq. 23.7 is an example of how Dalton\u2019s law is used in the lung. According to Henry\u2019s law, the concentration of a gas dissolved in a liquid is proportional to its partial pressure. The second important principle is that the partial pressure of a gas (Pgas) is equal to the fraction of that gas in the gas mixture (Fgas) multiplied by the atmospheric (barometric) pressure: Equation 23.8 Ambient air is composed of approximately 21% O2 and 79% N2. Therefore, the partial pressure of O2 in inspired ambient air (PO2) is calculated as follows:"
