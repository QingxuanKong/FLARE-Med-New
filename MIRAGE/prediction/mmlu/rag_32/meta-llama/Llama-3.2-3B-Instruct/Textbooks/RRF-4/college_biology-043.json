We can start by considering the anatomy of a woody stem and the process of gas exchange. Gas exchange occurs in the lungs, not in woody stems. However, we can look at the structures that are involved in gas exchange in other parts of the plant, such as the roots and leaves. In the context of this question, we are looking for structures that act as sites of gas exchange in a woody stem. The correct answer can be inferred by considering the function of each option provided. Lenticels are small, raised structures on the surface of stems and leaves that allow for gas exchange. Terminal buds are the growing tips of stems and branches, and internodes are the regions between nodes on a stem. Nodes are the points where leaves, branches, or roots are attached to the stem. Based on this information, lenticels are the structures that act as sites of gas exchange in a woody stem.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

To meet the changing metabolic needs of the body, gas exchange depends on the speed at which fresh gas is brought to the alveoli and the rapidity with which the metabolic products of respiration (i.e., CO2) are removed. Two major factors determine the speed at which gas flows into the airways for a given pressure change: the pattern of gas flow and the resistance to airflow by the airways. Patterns of Airflow There are two major patterns of gas flow in the airways\u2014 laminar and turbulent. Laminar flow is parallel to the airway walls and is present at low flow rates. As the flow rate increases and particularly as the airways divide, the flow stream becomes unsteady and small eddies develop. At higher flow rates the flow stream is disorganized and turbulence occurs."

Alveolar spaces are responsible for most of the lung\u2019s volume; these spaces are divided by tissue known collectively as the interstitium. The interstitium is composed primarily of lung collagen fibers and is a space in which fluid and cells can potentially accumulate. An adult has approximately 5 \u00d7 108 alveoli ( Fig. 20.6 ), which are composed of type I and type II epithelial cells. Under normal conditions, type I and type II cells exist in a 1 : 1 ratio. The type I cell occupies 96% to 98% of the surface area of the alveolus, and it is the primary site for gas exchange. The thin cytoplasm of type I cells is ideal for optimal gas diffusion. In addition, the basement membrane of type I cells and the capillary endothelium are fused, which minimizes the distance for gas diffusion and thereby facilitates gas exchange."

The total volume of gas in each breath that does not participate in gas exchange is called the physiological dead space. It includes the anatomical dead space and the dead space secondary to ventilated but unperfused alveoli. 2. The sum of the partial pressures of a gas is equal to the total pressure. The partial pressure of a gas (Pgas) is equal to the fraction of the gas in the gas mixture (Fgas) multiplied by the total pressure (Ptotal). The conducting airways do not participate in gas exchange. Therefore, the partial pressures of O2, N2, and water vapor in humidified air remain unchanged in the airways until the gas reaches the alveolus. 3. The partial pressure of O2 in the alveolus is given by the alveolar air equation ( Eq. 23.13 ). This equation is used to calculate the AaDO2, a useful measurement of abnormal arterial O2. 4."

Where large surfaces are required, they are often organized as branching tubular structures. The lung is an example. It originates from epithelial buds that grow out from the floor of the foregut and invade neighboring mesenchyme to form the bronchial tree, a system of tubes that branch repeatedly as they extend. Endothelial cells that form the lining of blood vessels invade the same mesenchyme, thereby creating a system of closely apposed airways and blood vessels, as required for gas exchange in the lung (Figure 21\u201352). This whole process of branching morphogenesis depends on signals that pass in both directions between the growing epithelial buds and the mesenchyme. Genetic studies in mice indicate that FGF proteins and their receptor tyrosine kinases play a central part in these signaling processes. FGF signaling has various roles in"

When the shoot of a germinating seedling, for instance, encounters an obstacle, ethylene promotes a complex response that allows the seedling to safely bypass the obstacle (Figure 15\u201369B and C). Plants have various ethylene receptors, which are located in the endoplasmic reticulum and are all structurally related. They are dimeric, multipass transmembrane proteins, with a copper-containing ethylene-binding domain and a domain that interacts with a cytoplasmic protein called CTR1, which is closely related Figure 15\u201369 The ethylene-mediated triple response that occurs when the growing shoot of a germinating seedling encounters an obstacle underground."

Moreover, CO2 loading and the resulting intravascular shifts in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve occur in the precapillary vessels. Hence, in addition to gas exchange at the capillaries, O2 and CO2 pass directly between adjacent arterioles and venules and possibly between arteries and veins (countercurrent exchange). The countercurrent exchange represents a diffusional shunting of gas away from the capillaries; this shunting may limit the supply of O2 to the tissue at low blood flow rates."

The blood that bypasses the gas-exchange unit is thus shunted, and because the blood is deoxygenated, this type of bypass is called a right-to-left shunt. Most anatomical shunts develop within the heart, and they develop when deoxygenated blood from the right atrium or ventricle crosses the septum and mixes with blood from the left atrium or ventricle.

(C) If the shoot encounters an obstacle, such as a piece of gravel in the soil, the seedling responds to the encounter in three ways. First, it thickens its stem, which can then exert more force on the obstacle. Second, it shields the tip of the shoot (at top) by increasing the curvature of a specialized hook structure. Third, it reduces the shoot\u2019s tendency to grow away from the direction of gravity, so as to avoid the obstacle. (Courtesy of Melanie Webb.) in sequence to the Raf MAP kinase kinase kinase discussed earlier (see Figure 15\u201349). Surprisingly, it is the empty receptors that are active and keep CTR1 active. By an unknown signaling mechanism, active CTR1 stimulates the ubiquitylation and degradation in proteasomes of a nuclear transcription regulator called EIN3, which is required for the transcription of ethylene-responsive genes. In this way, the empty but active"
