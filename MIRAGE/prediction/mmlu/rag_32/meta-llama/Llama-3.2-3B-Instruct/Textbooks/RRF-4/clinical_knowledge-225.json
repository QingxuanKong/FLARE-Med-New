The etiology of this condition is often obscure, though in some instances the nerve injury may be a direct effect of increased pressure on the median nerve caused by overuse, swelling of the tendons and tendon sheaths (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), and cysts arising from the carpal joints. Increased pressure in the carpal tunnel is thought to cause venous congestion that produces nerve edema and anoxic damage to the capillary endothelium of the median nerve itself. Patients typically report pain and pins-and-needles sensations in the distribution of the median nerve. Weakness and loss of muscle bulk of the thenar muscles may also occur. Gently tapping over the median nerve (in the region of the flexor retinaculum) readily produces these symptoms (Tinel\u2019s sign)."

Falls and coworkers, in 1955, and later Rukavina and associates described a large group of patients of Swiss stock living in Indiana who developed, in their fourth and fifth decades, a syndrome of acroparesthesias in the hands as a result of deposition of amyloid in the connective tissues and beneath the carpal ligaments. Similar kindreds of German descent were recognized in Maryland. There were sensory loss and atrophic muscle weakness in the distribution of the median nerves, which were compressed. Section of the carpal ligaments relieved the symptoms. In some of the patients, other nerves of the arms were said to have become involved later. Vitreous deposits have been observed frequently in this form of the disease. As with the Portuguese type, an abnormal transthyretin is the basis of the deposition of amyloid."

            "content": "The problem was diagnosed as median nerve compression. The median nerve is formed from the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus anterior to the axillary artery and passes into the arm anterior to the brachial artery. At the level of the elbow joint it sits medial to the brachial artery, both of which are medial to the tendon of the biceps. In the forearm the nerve courses through the anterior compartment and passes deep to the flexor retinaculum. It innervates most of the muscles of the forearm, the thenar muscles, the two lateral lumbricals, and the skin over the palmar surface of the lateral three and one-half digits and over the lateral side of the palm and the middle of the wrist. In this patient, the median nerve initially was believed to be trapped below the flexor retinaculum (carpal tunnel syndrome)."

            "content": "Treatment Surgical division of the carpal ligament with decompression of the nerve is curative but is required only in severe and protracted cases. Splinting of the wrist to limit flexion almost always relieves the discomfort but denies the patient the full use of the hand for some time. It is a useful temporizing measure for a few weeks, as is the injection of hydrocortisone into the carpal tunnel. Studies of oral corticosteroids give conflicting results. Treatment of an underlying condition such as arthritis, hypothyroidism and possibly diabetes, is often helpful. Some patients have benefited, paradoxically, from the stopping of corticosteroids or estrogen. Also, some practitioners favor the use of nonsteroid anti-inflammatory medication, but we have been generally unimpressed with the results. Most often, splinting and local steroid injections are very satisfactory in the short term, especially if the symptoms are of recent onset."

A carpal tunnel brace can be very helpful in maintaining adequate extension at the wrist, thereby \u201copening\u201d the tunnel and reducing compression on the medial nerve. Only if these strategies do not work is a surgical intervention indicated. Mitral Valve Prolapse Syndrome, Dysautonomia, and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome"
