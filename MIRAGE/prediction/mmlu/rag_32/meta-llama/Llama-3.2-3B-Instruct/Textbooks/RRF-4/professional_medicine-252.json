    "question": "A 78-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital for replacement of her left knee joint due to degenerative joint disease. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus, a long history of hypertension, and chronic renal failure presumed secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Reversible causes of renal failure have been excluded. She underwent a tonsillectomy at age 9 years and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at age 68 years. Serum creatinine concentration on admission was 6.0 mg/dL. Her current therapy includes a low-sodium, low-protein American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet, enalapril, and acetaminophen. She is a retired seamstress. She and her husband live on a farm 90 miles from the nearest dialysis facility. In considering longterm treatment options for this patient, which of the following is the most appropriate factor to consider?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate factor to consider for long-term treatment options for this patient, we need to evaluate her medical history, current health status, and treatment goals. The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, hypertension, and a history of arthritis. She is a retired seamstress living 90 miles from the nearest dialysis facility, which may limit her access to regular medical care. The patient is currently on a low-sodium, low-protein diet, enalapril, and acetaminophen. Considering these factors, we need to weigh the pros and cons of different treatment options, including dialysis, transplantation, and conservative management. The patient's history of an abdominal operation (laparoscopic cholecystectomy) may increase her risk for future surgical complications, but it is not a major concern in this context. Her history of arthritis is relevant to her joint disease, but it is not directly related to her renal failure. Her suitability for home dialysis is limited by her remote location from the nearest facility. Her eligibility to receive Medicare is a significant factor, as it may impact her access to healthcare services and financial resources. Therefore, considering the patient's eligibility to receive Medicare is the most appropriate factor to consider for long-term treatment options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The dramatic increase in the number of patients with diabetic nephropathy reflects the epidemic increase in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Approximately 40% of patients with types 1 or 2 diabetes develop nephropathy, but due to the higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes (90%) compared to type 1 (10%), the majority of patients with diabetic nephropathy have type 2 disease. Renal lesions are more common in African-American, Native American, Polynesian, and Maori populations. Risk factors for the development of diabetic nephropathy include hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, a family history of diabetic nephropathy, and gene polymorphisms affecting the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis."

These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm. Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed. Laboratory findings include a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 24.9 \u03bcIU/mL"

Results on blood tests performed by the clinical laboratory are shown below: H=High;L=Low. Microscopic examination of her urine revealed a urinary tract infection (UTI). Diagnosis: MW is in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) that was precipitated by a UTI. [Note: Diabetes increases the risk for infections such as UTI.] Immediate Treatment: MW was rehydrated with normal saline given intravenously (IV). She also was given insulin IV. Blood glucose, ketone bodies, and electrolytes were measured periodically. Antibiotic treatment of her UTI was started. Long-Term Treatment: Diabetes increases the risk for macrovascular complications (such as coronary artery disease and stroke) and microvascular complications (such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy). Ongoing monitoring for these complications will be continued."

            "content": "With the widespread availability of dialysis, the lives of hundreds of thousands of patients with ESRD have been prolonged. In the United States alone, there are now approximately 615,000 patients with ESRD, the vast majority of whom require dialysis. The incidence rate for ESRD is 357 cases per million population per year. The incidence of ESRD is disproportionately higher in African Americans (940 per million population per year) as compared with white Americans (280 per million population per year). In the United States, the leading cause of ESRD is diabetes mellitus, currently accounting for nearly 45% of newly diagnosed cases of ESRD. Approximately 30% of patients have ESRD that has been attributed to hypertension, although it is unclear whether in these cases hypertension is the cause or a consequence of vascular disease or other unknown causes of kidney failure. Other prevalent causes of ESRD include glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, and obstructive uropathy."

The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is not recommended for routine clinical use because of its higher cost, time requirement, and limited reproducibility. Initiate diabetes education classes to learn blood glucose monitoring and diabetes medications; to learn signs, symptoms, and complications; and to learn how to manage sick days. Place patient on ADA diet with appropriate caloric, sodium, and lipid restrictions. Establish cardiac risk factors, kidney function (serum creatinine, urine for microalbuminuria). If neuropathy is present, refer to a neurologist. Establish extent of fundoscopic lesion (refer to ophthalmologist as needed). Check feet and toenails at least once a year and refer to a foot specialist. Use finger-stick blood glucose for daily diabetic control. Follow chronic glycemic control by HgA1c every 2 to 3 months in the office."

It is 64e-6 conceivable that residual hypovolemic hyponatremia attenuated the recovery of the plasma Na+ concentration. Alternatively, attenuated recovery was due to persistent effects of the single dose of DDAVP. Of note, although the plasma half-life of DDAVP is only 1\u20132 h, pharmacodynamic studies indicate a much more prolonged effect on urine output and/or urine osmolality. One final consideration is the effect of the patient\u2019s initial renal dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the administered DDAVP, which is renally excreted; DDAVP should be administered with caution for the reinduction of hyponatremia in patients with chronic kidney disease or acute renal dysfunction. A 44-year-old woman was referred from a local hospital after presenting with flaccid paralysis. Severe hypokalemia was documented (2.0 meq/L), and an infusion containing KCl was initiated."

While this patient\u2019s diabetes is under control, her hypertension places her at risk for microvascular complications of diabetes, thus making it necessary to reevaluate her current medication adherence, doses of benazepril for hypertension and simvastatin for hyper-lipidemia, and duration of therapy. She would benefit from meeting with a nutritionist because packaged frozen dinners can be high in sodium, and this may be elevating her blood pressure. Adding exercise to her weekly routine could also help with weight control and overall cardiovascular health. The data supporting benefits of St. John\u2019s wort in patients with hot flashes are preliminary but show promise. Good data support use of the herb to alleviate symptoms of mild to moderate depression when"

A rise in serum creatinine of at least 85 \u03bcmol/L (1 mg/dL) within 48 h of contrast administration is often used as a definition of contrast nephropathy, although other causes of acute renal failure must be excluded. The prognosis is usually favorable, with serum creatinine levels returning to baseline within 1\u20132 weeks. Risk factors for contrast nephropathy include advanced age (>80 years), preexisting renal disease (serum creatinine exceeding 2 mg/dL), solitary kidney, diabetes mellitus, dehydration, paraproteinemia, concurrent use of nephrotoxic medication or chemotherapeutic agents, and high contrast dose. Patients with diabetes and those with mild renal failure should be well hydrated prior to the administration of contrast agents, although careful consideration should be given to alternative imaging techniques such as MRI, noncontrast"

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."
