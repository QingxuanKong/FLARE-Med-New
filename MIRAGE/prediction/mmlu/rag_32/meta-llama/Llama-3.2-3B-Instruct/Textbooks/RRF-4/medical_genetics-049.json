Tumor suppressor genes are genes that normally prevent uncontrolled cell growth and are often inactivated in cancer. They can be inactivated by point mutations, deletions, or epigenetic changes. Oncogenes, on the other hand, are genes that have the potential to cause cancer when mutated or overexpressed. They can be activated by point mutations or amplifications. The question asks which of the given options is not a tumor suppressor gene. Let's examine each option: A. APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cell growth and division. B. NF1 (Neurofibromin 1) is a tumor suppressor gene that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and division, particularly in the development of neurofibromas. C. RB1 (Retinoblastoma 1) is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a critical role in regulating cell growth and division, and its inactivation is associated with retinoblastoma. D. RET (Ret proto-oncogene) is a proto-oncogene that encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth and division. It can become oncogenic when mutated or overexpressed. Based on this information, we can conclude that RET is not a tumor suppressor gene but rather a proto-oncogene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Similarly, deletions lead to the loss of a functional product and sometimes encompass the entire gene or even the entire chromosome arm, leading to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor DNA compared to the corresponding normal tissue DNA (Fig. 101e-4).

            "content": "Figure 20\u201323 The distinct types of DNA sequence changes found in oncogenes compared to tumor suppressor genes. In this diagram, mutations that change an amino acid are denoted by blue arrowheads, whereas mutations that truncate the polypeptide chain are marked by yellow arrowheads. (A) As in this example, oncogene mutations can be detected by the fact that the same nucleotide change is repeatedly found among the missense mutations in a gene. (B) For tumor suppressor genes, by contrast, missense mutations that abort protein synthesis by creating stop codons predominate. (Adapted from B. Vogelstein et al., Science 339:1546\u20131558, 2013.) chromosome alterations found in the particular primary tumor. As indicated, purple lines connect sites at which two different chromosomes have become joined to create an interchromosomal rearrangment, while green lines connect the sites of rearrangements found within a single chromosome. The intrachromosomal rearrangements can be seen to predominate, and"

            "content": "Another tumor-suppressor gene, BRCA1, has been identified at the chromosomal locus 17q21; this gene encodes a zinc finger protein, and the protein product functions as a transcription factor and is involved in gene repair. Women who inherit a mutated allele of this gene from either parent have at least a 60\u201380% lifetime chance of developing breast cancer and about a 33% chance of developing ovarian cancer. The risk is higher among women born after 1940, presumably due to promotional effects of hormonal factors. Men who carry a mutant allele of the gene have an increased incidence of prostate cancer and breast cancer. A fourth gene, termed BRCA2, which has been localized to chromosome 13q12, is also associated with an increased incidence of breast cancer in men and women."
