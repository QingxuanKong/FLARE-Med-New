The complex accepts electrons one at a time from cytochrome c and passes them to molecular oxygen. In total, four electrons and four protons are needed to convert one molecule of oxygen to water. We have previously discussed how the redox potential reflects electron affinities. Figure 14\u201319 presents an outline of the redox potentials measured along the respiratory chain. These potentials change in three large steps, one across each proton-translocating respiratory complex. The change in redox potential between any two electron carriers is directly proportional to the free energy released when an electron transfers between them. Each complex acts as an energy-conversion device by harnessing some of this free-energy change to pump H+ across the inner membrane, thereby creating an electrochemical proton gradient as electrons pass along the chain."

Supercomplexes can be isolated by mild detergent treatment of mitochondria, and their structure has been deciphered by single-particle cryoelectron microscopy. the bovine heart supercomplex has a total mass of 1.7 megadaltons. Shown is a schematic of such a complex that consists of NaDh dehydrogenase, cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase, as indicated. the facing quinol-binding sites of NaDh dehydrogenase and cytochrome c reductase, plus the short distance between the cytochrome c-binding sites in cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome c oxidase, facilitate fast, efficient electron transfer. Cofactors active in electron transport are marked as a yellow dot (flavin mononucleotide), red and yellow dots (iron\u2013sulfur clusters), Q (quinone),"

Thus, a function of CoQ is to link the flavoprotein dehydrogenases to the cytochromes. 5. Cytochromes: The remaining members of the ETC are cytochrome proteins. Each contains a heme group (a porphyrin ring plus iron). Unlike the heme groups of hemoglobin, the cytochrome iron is reversibly converted from its ferric (Fe3+) to its ferrous (Fe2+) form as a normal part of its function as an acceptor and donor of electrons. Electrons are passed along the chain from cytochrome bc1 (Complex III), to cytochrome c, and then to cytochromes a + a3 ([Complex IV] see Fig. 6.8). As electrons flow, four H+ are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane at Complex III and two at Complex IV. [Note: Cytochrome c is located in the intermembrane space, loosely associated with the outer face of the inner membrane. As seen with CoQ, cytochrome c is a mobile electron carrier.] 6."

            "content": "The classic two-step cyanide antidote kit includes two IV solutions: sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate. It may also include amyl nitrite perles for inhalation. Nitrites are methemoglobin formers; when administered to a patient, nitrite converts a fraction of the body\u2019s hemoglobin into methemoglobin by converting heme iron from Fe++ to Fe+++. CN\u2013 has a greater affinity for methemoglobin Fe+++ than for cytochrome a3. As a result, administration of nitrite creates a \u201csink\u201d of cyanmethemoglobin; formation of methemoglobin pulls CN\u2013 off mitochondrial cytochrome a3, allowing cellular respiration to resume. Recent work suggests that nitrites may also work via a second mechanism involving the neurotransmitter nitrous oxide; if so, this mechanism may explain why cyanide-poisoned patients improve after nitrite administration faster than is explained by the known rate of methemoglobin formation."

The main areas of ROS production are oxida-tive processes involving the mitochondrial electron transport chain as well as those mediated by NADPH oxidases (NOX), a large class of ROS producing enzymes. Additional metabolic enzymes such as lipoxygenases, cytochrome P-450 and b5, and cyclooxygenases also produce ROS as by-products of their reactions.107 The synthesis of ROS is regulated at several check-points and via complex signaling mechanisms, including Ca2+ signaling, phosphorylation, and small G protein activation, which influence both the recruitment of the molecules required for NOX function and the synthesis of ROS in the mitochondria. Not surprisingly, NOX activation is triggered by a number of inflammatory mediators (e.g., TNF, chemokines, lysophospho-lipids, complement, and leukotrienes).Host cells are"
