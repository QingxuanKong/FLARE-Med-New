    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the unique physiological adaptations of marine birds that allow them to maintain their internal osmolarity despite drinking seawater. The key is to understand how they regulate their water and salt balance. The correct answer can be deduced by analyzing the characteristics of each option in relation to the physiological needs of marine birds.\\n\\nFirst, let's consider option A: Marine birds absorb water from the environment through specialized salt-exchange glands and produce large volumes of dilute urine in the kidneys. This option seems plausible because it addresses both the need to dilute the blood and the need to excrete excess salt. However, it is essential to consider the specific physiological mechanisms involved in this process.\\n\\nNext, let's examine option B: Marine birds absorb salts from the environment through specialized salt-exchange glands and produce large volumes of concentrated urine in the kidneys. This option seems less likely because it would require the kidneys to concentrate the urine, which would increase the osmolarity of the blood, rather than decrease it.\\n\\nOption C: Marine birds excrete salts through specialized salt-exchange glands and excrete small volumes of urine. This option is also unlikely because it would not address the need to dilute the blood, and the small volume of urine would not be sufficient to counteract the high salt content of seawater.\\n\\nOption D: Marine birds excrete salts and nitrogenous wastes through specialized nasal glands. This option is not feasible because nasal glands are not adapted for the excretion of salts and nitrogenous wastes.\\n\\nConsidering the above analysis, the most plausible option is A: Marine birds absorb water from the environment through specialized salt-exchange glands and produce large volumes of dilute urine in the kidneys. This option addresses both the need to dilute the blood and the need to excrete excess salt, which would help maintain a hypoosmotic internal environment despite drinking seawater.\\n\\nAnswer: A\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Alternatively, osmotic pressure is expressed in terms of osmolarity (see the following section). Regardless of the molecule, a solution containing 1 mmol/L of the molecule therefore exerts an osmotic pressure proportional to 1 mOsm/L. For molecules that dissociate in a solution, n of eq. 1.7 will have a value other than 1. For example, a 150-mmol/L solution of NaCl has an osmolarity of approximately 300 mOsm/L because each molecule of NaCl dissociates into a Na+ and a Cl\u2212 ion (i.e., n = 2). If dissociation of a molecule into its component ions is not complete, n will not be an integer.

The billions of cells that constitute the human body must maintain their volume and composition as well, but their task is much more difficult. This challenge, as well as its solution, was first articulated by the French physiologist Claude Bernard (1813-1878). He recognized that although cells within the body cannot maintain their volume and composition through exchanges with the environment, they can do so through exchanges with the fluid environment that surrounds them (i.e., the extracellular fluid). Bernard referred to the extracellular fluid as the milieu int\u00e9rieur (\u201cthe environment within\u201d).

One When water intake is low or water losses increase, the kidneys conserve water by producing a small volume of urine that is hyperosmotic with respect to plasma. When water intake is high, a large volume of hypoosmotic urine is produced. In a normal individual, urine osmolality (Uosm) can vary from approximately 50 to 1200 mOsm/kg H2O, and the corresponding urine volume can vary from approximately 18 L/day to 0.5 L/day. Importantly the kidneys can regulate excretion of water separately from excretion of total solute ( Fig. 35.1 ). The ability to regulate water excretion separate from excretion of solutes (e.g., Na+ , K+ , urea, etc.) is necessary for survival because it allows water balance to be achieved without upsetting the other homeostatic functions of the kidneys."

An increase in plasma osmolality evokes drinking and, via AVP action on the kidneys, conservation of water. Conversely, when plasma osmolality is decreased, thirst is suppressed and, in the absence of AVP, renal water excretion is enhanced. However, most of the time fluid intake is dictated by cultural factors and social situations. This is especially the case when thirst is not stimulated. In this situation, maintaining normal body fluid osmolality relies solely on the ability of the kidneys to excrete water.

For the level of the lake to remain constant (i.e., steady-state balance), the rate at which water is added, regardless of source, must be exactly matched by the amount of water lost, again regardless of route. Because the addition of water is not easily controlled and the loss by evaporation cannot be controlled, the only way to maintain a constant level of the lake is to regulate the amount that is lost through the spillways.

            "content": "Fig. 1.7 The movement of water across cell membranes occurs by the process of osmosis. The movement of water is passive, with the driving force for this movement being the osmotic pressure difference across the cell membrane. Fig. 1.8 illustrates the concept of osmosis and the measurement of the osmotic pressure of a solution. Osmotic pressure is determined by the number of solute molecules dissolved in the solution. It is not dependent on such factors as the size of the molecules, their mass, or their chemical nature (e.g., valence). Osmotic pressure (\u03c0), measured in atmospheres (atm), is calculated by van\u2019t Hoff\u2019s law as follows: Equation 1.7 \u02dc= nCRT, CHAPTER 1 Principles of Cell and Membrane Function"

In c ( ), plasma AVP rises in close correlation with plasma osmolarity before the latter reaches the normal range, indicating downward resetting of the osmostat. In d ( ), plasma AVP appears to be osmoregulated normally, suggesting that the inappropriate antidiuresis is caused by some other abnormality."

            "content": "The driving force for this water movement is an osmotic pressure difference. The osmotic pressure of both the ICF and ECF is determined by the molecules/ions present in these fluids. For simplicity, these can be divided into (1) molecules of low molecular weight (e.g., glucose) and ions (e.g., Na+) and (2) macromolecules (e.g., proteins). The osmotic pressures of both the ICF and ECF are in the range of 280 to 295 mOsm/kg H2O. For the ECF, the low-molecular-weight molecules and ions account for nearly all of this pressure because the osmotic pressure contributed by proteins is only 1 to 2 mOsm/kg H2O. The molecules/ions contributing to the osmotic pressure within the cell are less well understood, but they also include low-molecular-weight molecules (e.g., glucose), ions (e.g., Na+), and macromolecules (e.g., proteins). The fact that cell volume remains constant when ECF osmolality is constant means that the osmotic pressure inside the cells is equal to that of the ECF. If an osmotic"
