    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the function and structure of phalloidin and its effect on actin filaments. Phalloidin is a toxin made by the death cap mushroom that binds to actin subunits and disrupts actin function. Actin filaments are composed of actin subunits and are part of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. They are involved in various cellular processes such as cell movement, shape, and division. The question asks which structure would be most directly affected by phalloidin. To answer this, we need to consider the structure and function of the options provided: Intermediate filaments, Collagen fibers, Microfilaments, and Microtubules. Intermediate filaments are a type of cytoskeletal filament, but they are not directly related to actin filaments. Collagen fibers are extracellular structures that provide strength and elasticity to connective tissue. Microfilaments, also known as actin filaments, are composed of actin subunits and are directly related to the cytoskeleton. Microtubules are another type of cytoskeletal filament composed of tubulin subunits and are involved in cell division and intracellular transport. Given that phalloidin binds to actin subunits and disrupts actin function, the structure most directly affected by phalloidin would be Microfilaments, as they are composed of actin subunits and are directly impacted by phalloidin's binding and disrupting effect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The cytochalasins are fungal products that prevent actin polymerization by binding to the plus end of actin filaments. Latrunculin prevents actin polymerization by binding to actin subunits. The phalloidins are toxins isolated from the Amanita mushroom that bind tightly all along the side of actin filaments and stabilize them against depolymerization. All of these compounds cause dramatic changes in the actin cytoskeleton and are toxic to cells, indicating that the function of actin filaments depends on a dynamic equilibrium between filaments and actin monomers (Table 16\u20131)."

According to one model, gelsolin binds the side of an actin filament until a thermal fluctuation creates a small gap between neighboring subunits, at which point gelsolin inserts itself into the gap to break the filament. After the severing event, gelsolin remains attached to the actin filament and caps the new plus end. Another important actin-filament destabilizing protein, found in all eukaryotic cells, is cofilin. Also called actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin binds along the length of the actin filament, forcing the filament to twist a little more tightly (Figure 16\u201320). This mechanical stress weakens the contacts between actin subunits in the filament, making the filament brittle and more easily severed by thermal motions, generating filament ends that undergo rapid disassembly. As a result, most of the actin filaments inside cells are shorter lived than are filaments formed from pure actin in a test tube."

Some members of the formin protein family have unstructured domains or \u201cwhiskers\u201d that contain several binding sites for profilin or the profilin\u2013actin complex. These flexible domains serve as a staging area for addition of actin to the growing plus end of the actin filament when formin is bound.

It can also transiently cap pure actin filaments and significantly reduce their elongation and depolymerization rates. A large family of tropomodulin proteins regulates actin filament length and stability in many cell types. For maximum effect, proteins that bind the side of actin filaments coat the filament completely, and must therefore be present in high amounts. In contrast, end-binding proteins can affect filament dynamics even when they are present at very low levels. Since subunit addition and loss occur primarily at filament ends, one molecule of an end-binding protein per actin filament (roughly one molecule per 200\u2013500 actin subunits) can be enough to transform the architecture of an actin filament network."

            "content": "Actin molecules (42 kDa) are abundant and may constitute as much as 20% of the total protein of some nonmuscle cells (Fig. 2.45). Similar to the tubulin in microtubules, actin molecules also assemble spontaneously by polymerization into a linear helical array to form filaments 6 to 8 nm in diameter. They are thinner, shorter, and more \ufb02exible than microtubules. Free actin molecules in the cytoplasm are referred to as G-actin (globular actin), in contrast to the polymerized actin of the filament, which is called F-actin (flamentous actin). An actin filament is a polarized structure; its fast-growing end is referred to as the plus (barbed) end, and its slow-growing end is referred to as the minus (pointed) end. The dynamic process of actin polymerization requires the presence of K , Mg2 , and ATP, which is hydrolyzed to ADP after each G-actin molecule is incorporated into the filament (Fig. 2.46). The control and regulation of the polymerization process depends on the local"

            "content": "Bacteria Can Hijack the Host Actin Cytoskeleton The importance of accessory proteins in actin-based motility and force production is illustrated beautifully by studies of certain bacteria and viruses that use components of the host-cell actin cytoskeleton to move through the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm of mammalian cells is extremely viscous, containing organelles and cytoskeletal elements that inhibit diffusion of large particles like bacteria or viruses. To move around in a cell and invade neighboring cells, several pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes (which causes a rare but serious form of food poisoning), overcome this problem by recruiting and activating the Arp 2/3 complex at their surface. The Arp 2/3 complex nucleates the assembly of actin filaments that generate a substantial force and push the bacterium through the"

            "content": "Figure 16\u201380 A model for protrusion of the actin meshwork at the leading edge. Two time points during advance of the lamellipodium are illustrated, with newly assembled structures at the later time point shown in a lighter color. Nucleation is mediated by the Arp 2/3 complex at the front. Newly nucleated actin filaments are attached to the sides of preexisting filaments, primarily at a 70\u00b0 angle. Filaments elongate, pushing the plasma membrane forward because of some sort of anchorage of the array behind. At a steady rate, actin filament plus ends become capped. After newly polymerized actin subunits hydrolyze their bound ATP in the filament lattice, the filaments become susceptible to depolymerization by cofilin. This cycle causes a spatial separation between net filament assembly at the front and net filament disassembly at the rear, so that the actin filament network as a whole can move forward, even though the individual filaments within it remain stationary with respect to the"
