We can do this by looking at the information provided in the documents. According to document [5], the most frequent trisomies in spontaneous abortions and stillbirths are trisomies 13, 18, and 21, but trisomy 21 is the most common autosomal trisomy that results in live births. In contrast, trisomy 13 and 18 are much more severe disorders that result in low frequency of patients surviving past 1 year of age. Therefore, we can infer that trisomy 21 has the mildest effect on human development. Additionally, document [15] states that the karyotypic spectrum in girls with Turner syndrome (45,X) is wide, but Turner syndrome is not listed among the options. However, document [6] states that Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) and Turner syndrome (45,X) have relatively mild phenotypes, which are also not listed among the options. However, document [5] lists 47,XX,+21 as the most common autosomal trisomy seen in human infants, which is option D. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The translocation form of Down syndrome (described later) exhibits an uncommon but important exception to this principle. Some specific examples of diseases involving changes in the karyotype are presented next. Three autosomal trisomies (21, 18, and 13) and one deletion syndrome (cri du chat syndrome), which results from partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5, were the first chromosomal abnormalities identified. More recently, several additional trisomies and deletion syndromes (such as those affecting 22q) have been described.

Studies of humans with partial trisomy of chromosome 21 and mouse models of trisomy have identified the critical region of human chromosome 21 that is involved in the pathogenesis. Based on these studies, several gene clusters, each of which is predicted to participate in the same biologic pathway, have been implicated. For example, 16 genes are involved in the mitochondrial energy pathway, several are likely to influence CNS development, and one group is involved in folate metabolism. It is not known how each of these groups of genes is related to Down syndrome.

Jacobs and Lejeune in 1959 almost simultaneously were the first to note a triplication of the 21st chromosome in Down syndrome, and there followed the discovery of a number of other trisomies as well as deletions or translocations of other autosomal chromosomes and a lack or excess of one of the sex chromosomes. Such an event must take place sometime after the formation of the oocyte, during the long period when it lies fallow in the ovary or during the process of conception or germination and first cell divisions.

Mosaicism for a developmental disorder is one consequence of mitotic chromosome abnormalities, and another consequence is cancer, when the chromosome change 83e-7 confers a growth or proliferation advantage on the cell. The types of chromosome abnormalities seen in cancer are similar to those seen in the developmental disorders (e.g., aneuploidy, deletion, duplication, translocation, isochromosomes, rings, inversion). Tumor cells often have multiple chromosome changes, some of which happen early in the development of a tumor, and may contribute to its selective advantage, whereas others are secondary effects of the deregulation that characterizes many tumors. Chromosome changes in cancer have been studied extensively and have been shown to provide important diagnostic, classification, and prognostic information. The identification of cancer type\u2013specific translocation breakpoints has"

However, chromosomal markers for one particular chromosome are identical to the markers found on the chromosomes of the patient\u2019s mother or father (but not both). In UPD, the individual inherits two copies of one parent\u2019s chromosome and no copy from the other parent. UPD probably occurs through a few mechanisms, but the most common results from a spontaneous rescue mechanism. At the time of conception, through nondisjunction, the fertilized egg is trisomic for a particular chromosome, with two copies of one parent\u2019s chromosome and one copy of the other parent\u2019s chromosome; conceptuses with trisomy often miscarry early in development. Fetuses with UPD survive because they spontaneously lose one of three copies of the affected chromosome. If the single chromosome from one parent is lost, the patient has UPD."

Because abnormal fetal heart rate tracings are common during labor, mode of delivery and management of heart rate abnormalities should be discussed in advance. In older reports, more than half of undiagnosed fetuses underwent cesarean delivery for \"fetal distress\" (Schneider, 1981). Trisomy l3-Patau Syndrome. This constellation of fetal abnormalities and their association with an autosomal trisomy was irst described by Patau and colleagues (1960). The prevalence of trisomy 13 approximates 1 in 12,000 live births and 1 in 5000 recognized pregnancies, which includes abortuses and stillbirths (Loane, 2013; Parker, 2010). As with trisomy 18, trisomy 13 is highly lethal, and most afected fetuses are lost or terminated."

Whole chromosome karyotyping allowed the recognition of conditions such as Down syndrome and its association with triplication of the entire chromosome 21. As more refined techniques became available, such as high-resolution banding, subtle changes such as small deletions in chromosomal architecture became apparent, as occur in Angleman and Prader-Willi syndrome and fragile-X syndrome. What followed, by the use of linkage analysis and other genetic techniques, was the elucidation of single gene mutations that were obligatorily associated with malformations or developmental delays; most of the inherited metabolic disorders of infancy and childhood discussed in Chap. 36 are of this type but also certain gross malformations of the brain such as lissencephaly, discussed further on."

These are each composed of two paternal haploid sets of chromosomes contributed by dispermy and one maternal haploid set (see Fig. 20-2B). Less frequently, a similar haploid egg may be fertilized by an unreduced diploid 46,Y sperm. These triploid zygotes result in some embryonic development, however, it ultimately is a lethal fetal condition a oergensen, 2014; Lakovschek, 2011).

            "content": "Most studies of cell-free DNA have been conducted in highrisk pregnancies. Pragmatically, chromosomal abnormalities are individually so rare that even large studies of low-risk pregnancies contain few afected cases. Available data suggest that the high sensitivity and speciicity for Down syndrome detection are preserved in low-risk pregnancies (Norton, 2015; Pergament, 2014; Zhang, 2015). Importantly, the positive-predictive value of cell-free DNA screening still depends greatly on maternal age and the specific aneuploidy in question (see Table 14-5). For a woman in her early 20s, the positive-predictive value is approximately 50 percent for fetal trisomy 21, 15 percent for trisomy 18, and < 10 percent for trisomy 13. Hence, decisions for irreversible medical intervention should not be based on the results of this or other screening test alone. Important caveats are considered with selection of cell-free"

Although both copies are inherited from one parent, they are not identical. However, if chromosomes 6, 7, 11, 14, or 15 are involved, ofspring are at increased risk for an abnormality because of parent-of-origin diferences in gene expression (Shafer, 2001). Several genetic mechanisms may cause uniparental disomy, the most common of which is trisomic rescue, shown in Figure 13-9. After a nondisjunction event produces a trisomic conceptus, one of the three homologues may be lost. his will result in uniparental disomy for that chromosome in approximately one third of cases."
