In the pupillary light reflex, light that strikes the retina is processed by retinal circuits that excite W-type retinal ganglion cells (see Chapter 8). These cells respond to diffuse illumination. The axons of some of the W-type cells project through the optic nerve and tract to the pretectal area, where they synapse in the olivary pretectal nucleus. This nucleus contains neurons that also respond to diffuse illumination. Activity of neurons of the olivary pretectal nucleus causes pupillary constriction by means of bilateral connections with parasympathetic preganglionic neurons in the Edinger-Westphal nuclei. The reflex results in contraction of the pupillary sphincter muscles in both eyes, even when light is shone into only one eye."

Although difficult to appreciate, bilateral miosis may be detected (using pupillometry or direct observation) by noting a lag in the redilation of the initially small pupils when light is withdrawn (Smith and Smith, 1999). Stimulation or irritation of the sympathetic fibers, a rare phenomenon, has the opposite effect, that is, lid retraction, dilatation of the pupil, and apparent proptosis. Use is made of this phenomenon in the testing of the ciliospinal pupillary reflex, which is evoked by pinching the neck (afferent, C2, C3) and effecting pupillary enlargement through cervical efferent sympathetic fibers."

The second problem is the relative afferent pupillary defect, and how to recognize it; this was discussed earlier.

            "content": "By touching the cornea with a wisp of cotton, a response consisting of brief bilateral lid closure is normally observed. The corneal reflex depends on the integrity of pontine pathways between the fifth (afferent) and both seventh (efferent) cranial nerves; in conjunction with reflex eye movements, it is a useful test of pontine function. CNS-depressant drugs diminish or eliminate the corneal responses soon after reflex eye movements are paralyzed but before the pupils become unreactive to light. The corneal (and pharyngeal) response may be lost for a time on the side of an acute hemiplegia."

            "content": "One\u2019s first inclination is to attribute this disorder to photophobia or a response to an ocular irritation or corneal dryness, and indeed, the patient may state that bright light is annoying. For example, ocular inflammation, especially of the iris, may produce severe reflex blepharospasm. However, the spasms persist in dim light and even after anesthesia of the corneas. Patients may hold the lid open with a finger and the eyebrow is seen to be displaced downward; in some forms, there is tonic contraction of the frontalis muscles in an apparent attempt to aid lid opening."
