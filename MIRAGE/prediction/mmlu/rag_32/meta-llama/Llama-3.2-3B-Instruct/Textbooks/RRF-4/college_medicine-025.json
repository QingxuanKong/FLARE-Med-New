Comparison of the DNA sequences derived from transposons in the human and the mouse readily reveals some of the sequence additions (Figure 4\u201369).

Thus, if we assume that our common ancestor had a genome of human size (about 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs), mice would have lost a total of about 45% of that genome from accumulated deletions during the past 80 million years, while humans would have lost about 25%. However, substantial sequence gains from many small chromosome duplications and from the multiplication of transposons have compensated for these deletions. As a result, our genome size is thought to be practically unchanged from that of the last common ancestor of humans and mice, while the mouse genome is smaller by only about 0.3 billion nucleotides."

At an appropriate time, the gene encoding the enzyme can be activated to rearrange the target DNA sequence. Such a rearrangement is widely used to delete a specific gene in a particular tissue of a multicellular organism (Figure 5\u201366). It is particularly useful when the gene of interest plays a key role in the early development of many tissues, and a complete deletion of the gene from the germ line would cause death Figure 5\u201365 Switching gene expression by DNA inversion in bacteria."

The two major types of somatic lesions observed in tumor-suppressor genes during tumor development are point mutations and large deletions. Point mutations in the coding region of tumor-suppressor genes will frequently lead to truncated protein products or otherwise nonfunctional proteins. Similarly, deletions lead to the loss of a functional product and sometimes encompass the entire gene or even the entire chromosome arm, leading to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor DNA compared to the corresponding normal tissue DNA (Fig. 101e-4).

Although the DNA molecules in a cell can be randomly broken into small pieces by mechanical force, a fragment containing a single gene in a mammalian genome would still be only one among a hundred thousand or more DNA fragments, indistinguishable in their average size. How could such a gene be separated from all the others? Because all DNA molecules consist of an approximately equal mixture of the same four nucleotides, they cannot be readily separated, as proteins can, on the basis of their different charges and biochemical properties. The solution to this problem began to emerge with the discovery of restriction nucleases. These enzymes, which are purified from bacteria, cut the DNA double helix at specific sites defined by the local nucleotide sequence, thereby cleaving a long, double-stranded DNA molecule into fragments of strictly defined sizes."

The results show preferred regions where the variations occur, and these tend to be in or near regions that already contain blocks of segmental duplications. many of the changes include known genes.

Gene duplication: an existing gene can be accidentally duplicated so as to create a pair of initially identical genes within a single cell; these two genes may then diverge in the course of evolution. 3. DNA segment shuffling: two or more existing genes can break and rejoin to make a hybrid gene consisting of DNA segments that originally belonged to separate genes. 4. Horizontal (intercellular) transfer: a piece of DNA can be transferred from the genome of one cell to that of another\u2014even to that of another species. This process is in contrast with the usual vertical transfer of genetic information from parent to progeny. Each of these types of change leaves a characteristic trace in the DNA sequence of the organism, and there is clear evidence that all four processes have frequently"

You inoculate each of 10 cultures with a single E. coli bacterium, allow the cultures to grow until each contains 106 cells, and then measure the number of cells in each culture that carry a mutation in your gene of interest. You were so surprised by the initial results that you repeated the experiment to confirm them. Both sets of results display the same extreme variability, as shown in Table Q5\u20131. Assuming that the rate of mutation is constant, why do you suppose there is so much variation in the frequencies of mutant cells in different cultures?"

Because of the extremely high fidelity of DNA replication and DNA repair processes, random errors in maintaining the nucleotide sequences in genomes occur so rarely that only about one nucleotide in a thousand is altered in every million years in any particular eukaryotic line of descent. Not surprisingly, therefore, a comparison of human and chimpanzee chromosomes\u2014which are separated by about 6 million years of evolution\u2014 reveals very few changes. Not only are our genes essentially the same, but their order on each chromosome is almost identical. Although a substantial number of segmental duplications and segmental deletions have occurred in the past 6 million years, even the positions of the transposable elements that make up a major portion of our noncoding DNA are mostly unchanged."

In fact, there are multiple copies of the V, D, and J gene segments in germline DNA. It is the random selection of just one gene segment of each type that produces the great diversity of V regions among immunoglobulins. The numbers of functional gene segments of each type in the human genome, as determined by gene cloning and sequencing, are shown in Fig. 5.4. Not all the gene segments discovered are functional, as some have accumulated mutations that prevent them from encoding a functional protein. Such genes are termed \u2018pseudogenes.\u2019 Because there are many V, D, and J gene segments in germline DNA, no single gene segment is essential, resulting in a relatively large number of pseudogenes.
