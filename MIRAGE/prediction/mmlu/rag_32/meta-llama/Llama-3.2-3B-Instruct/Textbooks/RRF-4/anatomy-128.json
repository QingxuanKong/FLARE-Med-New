However, the question specifically asks about the enzyme that acts upon a particular nutrient. Document [2] states that the organic constituents of saliva are enzymes, mucin, and other factors, including amylase (an enzyme that initiates starch digestion). This indicates that amylase is the enzyme that acts upon carbohydrates, which includes starches.

            "content": "Secretion is initiated by multiple signals associated with the meal, including chemical, osmotic, and mechanical components. Secretion is elicited by the action of specific effector substances called secretagogues acting on secretory cells. Secretagogues work in one of the three ways that have already been described in Chapter 27\u2014endocrine, paracrine, and neurocrine. Constituents of Secretions Inorganic secretory components are region or gland specific, depending on the particular conditions required in that part of the GI tract. The inorganic components are electrolytes, including H+ and HCO3 \u2212 . Two examples of different secretions include acid (HCl) in the stomach, which is important to activate pepsin and start protein digestion, and HCO3 \u2212 in the duodenum, which neutralizes gastric acid and provides optimal conditions for the action of digestive enzymes in the small intestine."

            "content": "secretion, binds to lipase and prevents this inhibition. Bile salts activate phospholipase A and cholesterol esterase. Proteolytic enzymes include endopeptidases (trypsin, chymotrypsin), which act on internal peptide bonds of proteins and polypeptides; exopeptidases (carboxypeptidases, aminopeptidases), which act on the free carboxyland amino-terminal ends of peptides, respectively; and elastase. The proteolytic enzymes are secreted as inactive zymogen precursors. Ribonucleases (deoxyribonucleases, ribonuclease) are also secreted. Enterokinase, an enzyme found in the duodenal mucosa, cleaves the lysine-isoleucine bond of trypsinogen to form trypsin. Trypsin then activates the other proteolytic zymogens and phospholipase A2 in a cascade phenomenon. All pancreatic enzymes have pH optima in the alkaline range. The nervous system initiates pancreatic enzyme secretion. The neurologic stimulation is cholinergic, involving extrinsic innervation by the vagus nerve and subsequent innervation"

            "content": "A. Salivary \u03b1-amylase The major dietary polysaccharides are of plant (starch, composed of amylose and amylopectin) and animal (glycogen) origin. During mastication (chewing), salivary \u03b1-amylase acts briefly on dietary starch and glycogen, hydrolyzing random \u03b1(1\u21924) bonds. [Note: There are both \u03b1(1\u21924)-and \u03b2(1\u21924)-endoglucosidases in nature, but humans do not produce the latter. Therefore, we are unable to digest cellulose, a carbohydrate of plant origin containing \u03b2(1\u21924) glycosidic bonds between glucose residues.] Because branched amylopectin and glycogen also contain \u03b1(1\u21926) bonds, which \u03b1-amylase cannot hydrolyze, the digest resulting from its action contains a mixture of short, branched and unbranched oligosaccharides known as dextrins (Fig. 7.9). [Note: Disaccharides are also present as they, too, are resistant to amylase.] Carbohydrate digestion halts temporarily in the stomach, because the high acidity inactivates salivary \u03b1-amylase. B. Pancreatic \u03b1-amylase"
