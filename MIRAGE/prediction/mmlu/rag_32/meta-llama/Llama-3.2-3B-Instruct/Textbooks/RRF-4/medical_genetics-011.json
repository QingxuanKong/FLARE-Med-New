HbA2 appears early in fetal life. Correct answer = A. HbA accounts for over 90% of the hemoglobin in a normal adult. If HbA1c is included, the percentage rises to ~97%. Because 2,3bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) reduces the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, the weaker interaction between 2,3-BPG and HbF results in a higher oxygen affinity for HbF relative to HbA. HbF consists of \u03b12\u03b32. HbA1c is a glycated form of HbA, formed nonenzymically in red blood cells. HbA2 is a minor component of normal adult hemoglobin, first appearing shortly before birth and rising to adult levels (~2% of the total hemoglobin) by age 6 months. .2.

Any single hematocrit or hemoglobin value carries with it a likelihood of associated anemia. Thus, a hematocrit of <39% in an adult male or <35% in an adult female has only about a 25% chance of being normal. Hematocrit levels are less useful than hemoglobin levels in assessing anemia because they are calculated rather than measured directly. Suspected low hemoglobin or hematocrit values are more easily interpreted if previous values for the same patient are known for comparison. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines anemia as a hemoglobin level <130 g/L (13 g/dL) in men and <120 g/L (12 g/dL) in women."

Normal hemoglobins are tetramers composed of two pairs of similar chains. On average, the normal adult red cell contains 96% HbA (\u03b12\u03b22), 3% HbA2 (\u03b12\u03b42), and 1% fetal Hb (HbF, \u03b12\u03b32). In patients with sickle cell anemia, HbA is completely replaced by HbS, whereas in heterozygous carriers, only about half is replaced. HbS differs from HbA by having a valine residue instead of a glutamate residue at the 6th amino acid position in \u03b2-globin. On deoxygenation HbS molecules undergo a conformational change that allows polymers to form via intermolecular contacts involving the abnormal valine residue. These polymers distort the red cell, which assumes an elongated crescentic, or sickle, shape ( Fig. 12.3"

Because HbA greatly retards HbS polymerization, the red cells of HbS heterozygotes have little tendency to sickle in vivo. Such persons are said to have sickle cell trait. Similarly, because fetal hemoglobin (HbF) interacts weakly with HbS, newborns with sickle cell anemia do not manifest the disease until HbF falls to adult levels, generally around the age of 5 to 6 months. Hemoglobin C (HbC), another mutant \u03b2-globin, has a lysine residue instead of the normal glutamic acid residue at position 6.

The subunits occupy different relative positions in deoxyhemoglobin compared with oxyhemoglobin. The deoxy form of Hb is called the \u201cT,\u201d or taut (tense), conformation. It has a constrained structure that limits the movement of the polypeptide chains. The T form is the low-oxygen-affinity form of Hb. The binding of oxygen (O2) to the heme iron causes rupture of some of the ionic and hydrogen bonds and movement of the dimers. This leads to a structure called the \u201cR,\u201d or relaxed, conformation. The R form is the high-oxygen-affinity form of Hb.

The result of this mutation is an abnormal -globin chain in which the amino acid valine is substituted for glutamic acid in position 6. Hemoglobin containing this abnormal -globin chain is designated sickle hemoglobin (HbS). The substitution of the hydrophobic valine for the hydrophilic glutamic acid causes HbS to aggregate under conditions of reduced oxygen tension. Instead of the normal biconcave disc shape, many of the erythrocytes become sickle-shaped at low oxygen tension, hence the name of this disease (Fig. F10.3.1). Sickled erythrocytes are more rigid than normal cells and adhere more readily to the endothelial surface. Thus, sickled erythrocytes may pile up in the smallest capillaries, depriving portions of tissues and organs of oxygen and nutrients. Large-vessel obstruction may also occur, which in children frequently leads to stroke."

            "content": "Thalassemias are inherited disorders caused by mutations in globin genes that decrease the synthesis of \u03b1-or \u03b2-globin. Decreased synthesis of one globin results not only in a deficiency of Hb, but also in red cell damage that is caused by precipitates formed from excess unpaired \u201cnormal\u201d globin chains. The mutations that cause thalassemia are particularly common in Mediterranean, African, and Asian regions in which malaria is endemic. As with HbS, it is hypothesized that globin mutations associated with thalassemia protect against falciparum malaria. A diverse collection of \u03b1-globin and \u03b2-globin mutations underlies the thalassemias, which are autosomal codominant conditions. As described previously, adult hemoglobin, or HbA, is a tetramer composed of two \u03b1 chains and two \u03b2 chains. The \u03b1 chains are encoded by two \u03b1-globin http://ebooksmedicine.net"

In HbC, however, a lysine is substituted for the glutamate (as compared with a valine substitution in HbS). [Note: This substitution causes HbC to move more slowly toward the anode than HbA or HbS does (see Fig. 3.20).] Rare patients homozygous for HbC generally have a relatively mild, chronic hemolytic anemia. They do not suffer from infarctive crises, and no specific therapy is required. C. Hemoglobin SC disease"

            "content": "HPFH is characterized by continued synthesis of high levels of HbF in adult life. No deleterious effects are apparent, even when all of the hemoglobin produced is HbF. These rare patients demonstrate convincingly that prevention or reversal of the fetal to adult hemoglobin switch would provide effective therapy for sickle cell anemia and \u03b2 thalassemia. The two most important acquired hemoglobinopathies are carbon monoxide poisoning and methemoglobinemia (see above). Carbon monoxide has a higher affinity for hemoglobin than does oxygen; it can replace oxygen and diminish O2 delivery. Chronic elevation of carboxyhemoglobin levels to 10 or 15%, as occurs in smokers, can lead to secondary polycythemia. Carboxyhemoglobin is cherry red in color and masks the development of cyanosis usually associated with poor O2 delivery to tissues."

Hemoglobin analysis classically reveals an elevated HbA2 (3.5\u20137.5%), but some forms are associated with normal HbA2 and/or elevated HbF. Genetic counseling and patient education are essential. Patients with \u03b2 thalassemia trait should be warned that their blood picture resembles iron deficiency and can be misdiagnosed. They should eschew empirical use of iron, yet iron deficiency requiring replacement therapy can develop during pregnancy or from chronic bleeding."

            "content": "Quantitation of the hemoglobin profile is often desirable. HbA2 is frequently elevated in \u03b2 thalassemia trait and depressed in iron deficiency. HbF is elevated in HPFH, some \u03b2 thalassemia syndromes, and occasional periods of erythroid stress or marrow dysplasia. For characterization of sickle cell trait, sickle thalassemia syndromes, or HbSC disease, and for monitoring the progress of exchange transfusion therapy to lower the percentage of circulating HbS, quantitation of individual hemoglobins is also required. In most laboratories, quantitation is performed only if the test is specifically ordered. Complete characterization, including amino acid sequencing or gene cloning and sequencing, is readily available from several reference laboratories."

Figure 150-3 Genetic origins of the classic \u03b1-thalassemia syndromes due to gene deletions in the \u03b1-globin gene cluster. Hb Constant Spring (Hb CS) is an \u03b1-globin chain variant synthesized in such small amounts (1%\u20132% of normal) that it has the phenotypic impact of a severe non-deletion \u03b1-thalassemia allele; however, the \u03b1CS allele is always linked to a functioning \u03b1-globin gene, so it has never been associated with hydrops fetalis.

Detection by routine screening, removal from exposure, chelation therapy, and correction of iron deficiency are crucial to the potential development of affected children."
