Gastrulation is a critical stage in embryonic development where the blastula, a ball of cells, undergoes a series of complex cellular movements and transformations to form a multilayered structure containing a rudimentary internal gut. This process refines the body plan and sets the stage for the development of the three primary axes of the body. Given the options, let's analyze each choice in relation to the definition and process of gastrulation.\\n\\nOption A: mesoderm formation and occurs after neurulation. Gastrulation is actually the process that occurs before neurulation, as it is the initial step in the formation of the three primary axes of the body. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\\n\\nOption B: ectomesenchyme formation and occurs before neurulation. Ectomesenchyme formation is not a recognized term in the context of gastrulation. Gastrulation does involve the formation of ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm, but the term ectomesenchyme is not a standard term. This option is also incorrect.\\n\\nOption C: mesoderm formation and occurs before neurulation. Gastrulation is indeed the process by which the ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm are formed, and it occurs before neurulation. This process refines the body plan and sets the stage for the development of the three primary axes of the body. This option is correct.\\n\\nOption D: ectomesenchyme formation and occurs after neurulation. As mentioned earlier, ectomesenchyme formation is not a recognized term in the context of gastrulation. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: mesoderm formation and occurs before neurulation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

A frog, a chicken, and a mammal, for example, even though they develop in similar ways later, make eggs that differ radically in size and structure, and they begin their development with different sequences of cell divisions and cell specializations. Gastrulation occurs in all animal embryos, but the details of its timing, of the associated pattern of cell movements, and of the shape and size of the embryo as gastrulation proceeds are highly variable. Likewise, there is great variation in the time and manner in which the primary axes of the body become marked out. However, this polarization of the embryo usually becomes discernible very early, before gastrulation begins: it is the first step of spatial patterning."

The pluripotency is lost as gastrulation proceeds: a cell located in the endodermal germ layer, for example, can give rise to the cell types that will line the gut or form gut-derived organs such as the liver or pancreas, but it no longer has the potential to form mesoderm-derived structures such as skeleton, heart, or kidney.

Actin-dependent contraction along specific cell boundaries is coordinated with a loss of specific adherens junctions to allow cells to insert themselves between other cells (a process called intercalation), resulting in a longer and narrower epithelium. The mechanisms underlying the loss of adhesion along specific cell boundaries are not clear, but they depend in part on increased degradation of \u03b2-catenin, due to its phosphorylation by a protein kinase that is localized specifically at those boundaries."

Recent studies suggest that specific primary cilia observed in embryos, despite their 9 0 architectural pattern, are motile and play an important role in early embryonic development by generating the left\u2013right asymmetry of internal organs. During gastrulation, a clockwise rotation of these cilia was observed on the ventral surface of the bilaminar embryonic disc in the area near the primitive node, hence the name nodal cilia. These cilia contain motor proteins (dyneins or kinesins) and are capable of rotational movement in a counterclockwise direction as previously described. Most likely, the absence of the central pairs of microtubules is responsible for such movement, the trajectory of which resembles a full cone in contrast to a half-cone trajectory traceable in the motile 9 2 cilia (Table 5.2)."

            "content": "HCl is produced in the lumen of the intracellular canaliculi. Parietal cells have three different types of membrane receptors for substances that activate HCl secretion: gastrin receptors, histamine H2 receptors, and acetylcholine M3 receptor. Activation of the gastrin receptor by gastrin, a gastrointestinal peptide hormone, is the major path for parietal cell stimulation (Folder 17.2). After stimulation, several steps occur in the production of HCl (Fig. 17.11): FIGURE 17.10 \u2022 Diagram of a parietal cell. The cytoplasm of the parietal cell stains with eosin largely because of the extensive amount of membrane comprising the intracellular canaliculus, tubulovesicular system, mitochondria, and the relatively small number of ribosomes. This cell produces HCl and intrinsic factor."

For example, mRNA encoding the transcription regulator VegT is deposited at the vegetal pole during oogenesis. After fertilization, this mRNA is translated, and the resulting VegT protein activates a set of genes that code for signal proteins that induce mesoderm and endoderm, as discussed later."

The foregut is the only part of the gut tube suspended from the wall by both the ventral and dorsal mesenteries. A diverticulum from the anterior aspect of the foregut grows into the ventral mesentery, giving rise to the liver and gallbladder, and, ultimately, to the ventral part of the pancreas. The dorsal part of the pancreas develops from an outgrowth of the foregut into the dorsal mesentery. The spleen develops in the dorsal mesentery in the region between the body wall and presumptive stomach. In the foregut, the developing stomach rotates clockwise and the associated dorsal mesentery, containing the spleen, moves to the left and greatly expands. During this process, part of the mesentery becomes associated with, and secondarily fuses with, the left side of the body wall."
