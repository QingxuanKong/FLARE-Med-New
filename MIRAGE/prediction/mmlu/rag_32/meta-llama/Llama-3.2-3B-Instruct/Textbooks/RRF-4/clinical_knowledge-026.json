The question does not provide specific information about the medical procedure, but we can make an educated guess based on common medical practices. Options A, B, and D are not directly related to needle size, so we can eliminate them. Option C, inserting in the back of the hand, is a common procedure for peripheral intravenous access, which typically uses a 20-22 gauge needle. However, for children, smaller gauge needles are often used to minimize discomfort and reduce the risk of infection. A 14-16 gauge needle is smaller than the typical size used for peripheral intravenous access in children, so it is more likely to be used for other procedures. Fine-needle aspiration biopsies, which are often performed in children, typically use 20-22 gauge needles. However, the question asks about a 14-16 gauge needle, which is larger than the typical size used for fine-needle aspiration biopsies. Given the options, the most likely use for a 14-16 gauge needle is for inserting a central line or central venous access, which is often performed in children to provide nutrition and medication directly into the superior vena cava. This is a common procedure in pediatric patients, especially in critically ill children who require high-flow access. \", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

A small inci-sion is made in the umbilicus, and a specialized spring-loaded (Veress) needle is placed in the abdominal cavity (Fig. 14-5). Figure 14-5. A. Tip of spring loaded (Veress) needle. B. Veress needle held at its serrated collar with a thumb and forefinger. At the umbilicus, the abdominal wall is grasped with fingers or penetrating towel clip to elevate the abdominal wall away from the underlying structures.ABBrunicardi_Ch14_p0453-p0478.indd 45901/03/19 4:58 PM 460BASIC CONSIDERATIONSPART IFigure 14-6.

The decision to remove these retained needles depends on symptoms and patient preference. Needles smaller than 13 mm have been found to be undetectable on plain radio-graph in several studies, have not been shown to cause injury to vessels or visceral organs, and can probably be left alone.Although the actual incidence of retained surgical instru-ments is unknown, they are retained with far less frequency than surgical sponges.

Durasphere is nonantigenic (thus no skin testing is required) and does not migrate. As compared with collagen, Durasphere appears to have similar reduction in leakage episodes and is more likely to require only a single injection (112). This bulking agent does require a larger-gauge needle for injection and is somewhat more difficult to inject than collagen. Macroplastique is approved for use in the United States. This material appears to offer better outcomes as defined by improvement and cure rates than Contigen at 12 months (113). A follow-up 24-month study revealed that 84% of patients maintained improvement from the 12-month assessment (114). A recent prospective randomized trial of Coaptite versus Contigen revealed similar improvement and safety profile at 12 months when compared Contigen. Coaptite required less material per"

Approximately one-third of pre-ventable deaths in children are related to airway management; therefore, if airway control cannot be obtained using a standard endotracheal method, surgical establishment of an airway should be considered. In children older than 11 years, standard crico-thyroidotomy is performed. Due to the increased incidence of subglottic stenosis in younger patients, needle cricothyroidotomy with either a 14or 16-gauge catheter is advocated, although it is rarely used. Alternatively, tracheostomy may be performed. In children, the standard physiologic response to hypovolemia is peripheral vasoconstriction and reflex tachycardia; this may mask significant hemorrhagic injury because children can compensate for up to a 25% loss of circulating blood volume with minimal external signs. \u201cNormal\u201d values for vital signs should not neces-sarily make one feel more secure about the child\u2019s volume status.

Techniques for aspiration and drainage of a pleural effusion. A. Needle aspiration. With careful appraisal of the x-ray findings, the best interspace is selected, and fluid is aspirated with a needle and syringe. Large volumes of fluid can be removed with a little patience and a large-bore needle. B. Chest tube insertion. After careful skin preparation, draping, and administration of local anesthesia, a short skin incision is made over the correct interspace. The incision is deepened into the intercostal muscles, and the pleura is penetrated (usually with a clamp). When any doubt exists about the status of the pleural"

A sample of the aspirate is also placed in a 90% alcohol solution for cytospin or cell pellet. The slides are stained by Papanicolaou\u2019s or Wright\u2019s stains and examined under the microscope. If a bloody aspirate is obtained, the patient should be repositioned in a more upright position and the biopsy repeated with a finer (25to 30-gauge) needle.After FNAB, the majority of nodules can be classified into several categories that determine further management. To address the issue of variability in the terminology of fine-needle aspiration (FNA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) hosted the \u201cNCI Thyroid Fine Needle Aspiration State of the Science Conference,\u201d which then defined the Bethesda criteria for thyroid FNA.19 Accordingly, optimum cytology specimens should have at least six follicles each containing at least 10 to 15 cells from at least two aspirates.The"
