Document [2] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) also mentions that steroids can cause dry mouth, although it does not specifically mention them as a primary cause.\\n\\nNext, let's examine analgesics (B). Document [2] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) lists anticholinergic agents as a group that can cause dry mouth, and analgesics are often classified under this category. Document [4] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) also mentions that some medications, including analgesics, can cause dry mouth.\\n\\nNow, let's consider antidepressants (C).

Its incidence varies among populations but has been reported in more than 20% of individuals older than 70 years of age. It is a major feature of the autoimmune disorder Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, in which it usually is accompanied by dry eyes (Chapter 5). A lack of salivary secretions is also a major complication of radiation therapy. However, xerostomia is most frequently observed as a side effect of many common classes of medications including anti-cholinergic, anti-depressant/ anti-psychotic, diuretic, anti-hypertensive, sedative, muscle relaxant, analgesic, and anti-histaminic agents. The oral cavity may reveal only dry mucosa and/or atrophy of the papillae of the tongue, with fissuring and ulcerations, or, in Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, concomitant inflammatory enlargement of the salivary glands.

The delirium associated with these agents is centrally mediated but may be accompanied by peripheral anticholinergic manifestations. This point is critical in the differential assessment of agitated confusional states because other compounds, particularly serotonergic agents used to treat depression, also can produce delirium. Thus, in addition to confusion, toxic levels of anticholinergic compounds typically cause dry skin, dry mouth, diminished bowel motility, and urinary hesitancy, if not frank retention.

Side effects, including taste disorders, dry mouth, drowsiness, and the need for frequent dosing (except for the transdermal form of clonidine), limited the popularity of this group of drugs. Sudden withdrawal of clonidine may precipitate a hypertensive crisis and induce angina. Clonidine withdrawal syndrome is more likely to occur with concomitant use of beta-blockers.

Tricyclic antidepressants are competitive antagonists at muscarinic cholinergic receptors, and anticholinergic findings (tachycardia, dilated pupils, dry mouth) are common even at moderate doses. Some tricyclics are also strong \u03b1 blockers, which can lead to vasodilation. Centrally mediated agitation and seizures may be followed by depression and hypotension. Most important is the fact that tricyclics inhibit the cardiac sodium channel, causing slowed conduction with a wide QRS interval and depressed cardiac contractility.

Scopolamine is one of the oldest remedies for seasickness and is as effective as any more recently introduced agent. It can be given by injection or by mouth or as a transdermal patch. The patch formulation produces significant blood levels over 48\u201372 hours. Useful doses by any route usually cause significant sedation and dry mouth. B. Ophthalmologic Disorders"

Adverse effects include euphoria, dysphoria, sedation, hallucinations, dry mouth, and increased appetite. It has some autonomic effects that may result in tachycardia, conjunctival injection, and orthostatic hypotension. Dronabinol has no significant drug-drug interactions but may potentiate the clinical effects of other psychoactive agents."

Unfortunately, there is no effective method for directly blocking the nicotinic effects of cholinesterase inhibition, because nicotinic agonists and antagonists cause blockade of transmission (see Chapter 27). To reverse the muscarinic effects, a tertiary (not quaternary) amine drug must be used (preferably atropine) to treat the CNS effects as well as the peripheral effects of the organophosphate inhibitors. Large doses of atropine may be needed to oppose the muscarinic effects of extremely potent agents like parathion and chemical warfare nerve gases: 1\u20132 mg of atropine sulfate may be given intravenously every 5\u201315 minutes until signs of effect (dry mouth, reversal of miosis) appear. The drug may have to be given many times, since the acute effects of the cholinesterase inhibitor may last 24\u201348 hours or longer. In this life-threatening situation, as much as"
