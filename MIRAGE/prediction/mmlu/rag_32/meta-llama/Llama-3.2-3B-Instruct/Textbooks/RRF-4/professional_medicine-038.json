He consumes an 800-calorie meal consisting of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. He then sleeps through the night without additional food or drink. Twelve hours later, his serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely involved in maintaining this man's serum glucose concentration?",

To understand which mechanism is most likely involved, let's consider each option: Option A: Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal - This option is unlikely because the man has not consumed any food or drink for 12 hours, so there is no ongoing gut absorption of calories. Option B: Glucose release from skeletal muscle - Skeletal muscle can release glucose through glycogenolysis, but this process would require a significant amount of time to contribute to the man's serum glucose concentration. Option C: Glycogenolysis in the liver - The liver plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis by storing and releasing glucose as needed. After a meal, the liver stores excess glucose as glycogen. 12 hours later, the liver can break down stored glycogen to release glucose into the bloodstream, which would help maintain the man's serum glucose concentration within the reference range. Option D: Increased leptin release from adipose tissues - Leptin is a hormone that helps regulate energy balance, but it is not directly involved in maintaining serum glucose concentration. Based on the above analysis, the most likely mechanism involved in maintaining the man's serum glucose concentration is glycogenolysis in the liver. This process allows the liver to release stored glucose into the bloodstream, helping to maintain a stable glucose level. answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Prepubertal patients with diabetes longer than 1 to 2 years typically require 0.5 to 1 U/kg/24 hours. During middle adolescence when elevated GH concentrations produce relative insulin resistance, insulin requirements increase by 40% to 50%, and doses of 1 to 2 U/kg/24 hours are typical. Balancing the daily meal plan with the dosages of insulin is crucial for maintaining serum glucose concentrations within the target range and avoiding hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The content and schedule of meals vary according to the type of insulin regimen used. It is recommended that carbohydrates contribute 50% to 65% of the total calories, protein 12% to 20%, and fat <30%. Saturated fat should contribute <10% of the total caloric intake, and cholesterol intake should be less than 300 mg/24 hours. High fiber content is recommended."

Thus the liver plays an important role in glucose metabolism by engaging in gluconeogenesis, conversion of other sugars to glucose. The liver also stores glucose as glycogen at times of glucose excess (e.g., postprandial period) and then releases stored glucose into the bloodstream as it is needed. This process is referred to as the glucose buffer function of the liver. When hepatic function is impaired, glucose concentrations in blood may rise excessively after ingestion of carbohydrate; conversely, between meals, hypoglycemia may be seen because of an inability of the liver to contribute to carbohydrate metabolism and interconversion of one sugar to another."

Insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity are related, and as an individual becomes more insulin resistant (by moving from point A to point B), insulin secretion increases. A failure to compensate by increasing the insulin secretion results initially in impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; point C) and ultimately in type 2 DM (point D). NGT, normal glucose tolerance.

Glucose metabolism in insulin-independent tissues is not altered in type 2 DM."

A patient is considered to have impaired fasting glucoseif fasting serum glucose concentration is 100 to 125 mg/dL or impaired glucose tolerance if 2-hour plasma glucose following an OGTT is 140 to 199 mg/dL. Sporadic hyperglycemia can occur in children, usually in the setting of an intercurrent illness.

            "content": "Special Problems: Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia occurs commonly in patients with DM1. For patients in adequate or better control, it is expected to occur on average once or twice a week. Severe episodes of hypoglycemia, resulting in seizures or coma or requiring assistance from another person, occur in 10% to 25% of these patients per year. Hypoglycemia in patients with DM1 results from a relative excess of insulin in relation to the serum glucose concentration. This excess can be caused by alterations in the dose, timing, or absorption of insulin; alterations of carbohydrate intake; or changes in insulin sensitivity resulting from activity. Defective counterregulatory responses also contribute to hypoglycemia. Abnormal glucagon responses to falling serum glucose concentrations develop within the first few years of the disease, and abnormalities in epinephrine release occur after a longer duration."

Patients typically present with symptoms of hyperglycemia. Onset is more insidious than that of type 1 DM, and patients often present with complications. Nonketotic hyperglycemia may be seen in the setting of poor glycemic control. Usually occurs in older adults with obesity (often truncal); has a strong genetic predisposition. Diagnostic criteria are the same as those for type 1 DM. Follow-up testing: Patients with no risk factors: Test at 45 years of age; retest every three years. Patients with impaired fasting glucose (> 110 mg/dL but < 126 mg/ dL): Follow up with frequent retesting. The goal of treatment is tight glucose control\u2014i.e., blood glucose levels ranging from 80 to 120 mg/dL and HbA1c levels < 7. Treatment measures include the following:"
