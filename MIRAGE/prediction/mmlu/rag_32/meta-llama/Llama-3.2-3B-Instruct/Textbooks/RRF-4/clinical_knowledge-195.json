The elbow joint allows for flexion and extension of the forearm, which suggests a hinge-like movement. This movement is characteristic of a hinge joint. Hinge joints are uniaxial, meaning they allow movement around one axis that passes transversely through the joint. The elbow joint also allows for supination and pronation of the hand, which indicates that it is not a simple hinge joint. However, the primary movement of the elbow is flexion and extension, making it a hinge joint. The elbow joint is also a complex joint involving three separate articulations: the ulnar-humeral joint, radial-humeral joint, and proximal radioulnar joint. These articulations work together to produce the hinge-like movement of the elbow joint. Based on the information provided, the elbow joint is best described as a synovial hinge joint.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The joints between the trochlear notch of the ulna and the trochlea of the humerus and between the head of the radius and the capitulum of the humerus are primarily involved with hinge-like flexion and extension of the forearm on the arm and, together, are the principal articulations of the elbow joint. The joint between the head of the radius and the radial notch of the ulna, the proximal radio-ulnar joint, is involved with pronation and supination of the forearm. The articular surfaces of the bones are covered with hyaline cartilage. The synovial membrane originates from the edges of the articular cartilage and lines the radial fossa, the coronoid fossa, the olecranon fossa, the deep surface of the joint capsule, and the medial surface of the trochlea (Fig. 7.72)."

            "content": "As the elbow flexion example shows, different roles are played by each muscle during a movement. The muscle that initiates, and is the prime cause of, the movement is called the agonist. Muscles that act similarly to the agonist are called synergists, whereas muscles whose activity opposes the action of the agonist are antagonists. In addition, muscles can act as fixators to immobilize a joint and in postural roles. Moreover, the relationship two muscles have to each other may depend on the specific movement being performed. For example, during elbow flexion, the triceps acts an antagonist to the biceps. In contrast, during supination of the forearm without rotation occurring about the elbow, the biceps (which also acts to supinate the forearm) is again an agonist, but the role of the triceps is that of an elbow fixator."

The point of attachment closest to the spine (proximal) is called the origin, whereas the point of attachment on the far side of the joint (distal) is called the insertion. These points of attachment occur through tendons (connective tissue) at the end of the muscle. Note that the point of insertion is close to the elbow joint, which enables a broad range of motion. Also note that the joint is spanned by a flexor muscle on one side and an extensor muscle on the opposite side of the joint. Thus contraction of the flexor muscle (see the biceps muscle in Fig. 12.1 ) results in a decrease in the angle of the elbow joint (bringing the forearm closer to the shoulder), whereas contraction of the extensor muscle (see the triceps muscle in Fig. 12.1 ) results in the reverse motion (extending the arm)."

Two muscles supinate and two muscles pronate the hand (Fig. 7.83). Biceps brachii. The biceps brachii muscle, the largest of the four muscles that supinate and pronate the hand, is a powerful supinator as well as a flexor of the elbow joint. It is most effective as a supinator when the forearm is flexed. Supinator. The second of the muscles involved with supination is the supinator muscle. Located in the posterior compartment of the forearm, it has a broad origin, from the supinator crest of the ulna and the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and from ligaments associated with the elbow joint."

Galeazzi\u2019s fracture is a fracture of the distal third of the radius associated with subluxation (partial dislocation) of the head of the ulna at the wrist joint. Colles\u2019 fracture is a fracture, and posterior displacement, of the distal end of the radius. Whenever a fracture of the radius or ulna is demonstrated radiographically, further images of the elbow and wrist should be obtained to exclude dislocations.

            "content": "The elbow joint is innervated predominantly by branches of the radial and musculocutaneous nerves, but there may be some innervation by branches of the ulnar and median nerves. The cubital fossa is an important area of transition between the arm and the forearm. It is located anterior to the elbow joint and is a triangular depression formed between two forearm muscles: the brachioradialis muscle originating from the lateral supra-epicondylar ridge of the humerus, and the pronator teres muscle originating from the medial epicondyle of the humerus (Fig. 7.77A). The base of the triangle is an imaginary horizontal line between the medial and lateral epicondyles. The bed or floor of the fossa is formed mainly by the brachialis muscle. The major contents of the cubital fossa, from lateral to medial, are: the tendon of the biceps brachii muscle, the brachial artery, and the median nerve (Fig. 7.77B)."

            "content": "The long and short heads converge to form a single tendon, which inserts onto the radial tuberosity. As the tendon enters the forearm, a flat sheet of connective tissue (the bicipital aponeurosis) fans out from the medial side of the tendon to blend with deep fascia covering the anterior compartment of the forearm. The biceps brachii muscle is a powerful flexor of the forearm at the elbow joint; it is also the most powerful supinator of the forearm when the elbow joint is flexed. Because the two heads of the biceps brachii muscle cross the glenohumeral joint, the muscle can also flex the glenohumeral joint. The biceps brachii muscle is innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve. A tap on the tendon of the biceps brachii at the elbow is used to test predominantly spinal cord segment C6."
