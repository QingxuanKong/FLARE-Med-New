At the age of 7 months, he was treated for osteomyelitis caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. He has been admitted to the hospital three times during the past 4 years for severe pneumonia. He appears moderately ill. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Abdominal examination shows an enlarged, tender liver. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows an intrahepatic abscess. Culture of the abscess fluid grows Staphylococcus aureus. Further analysis shows failure of the neutrophils to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus. This patient has an increased susceptibility to infection as a result of which of the following abnormalities?",

He also has an intrahepatic abscess with Staphylococcus aureus growth. The key clue to this question is the failure of neutrophils to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus, which is a hallmark of Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD). CGD is a disorder characterized by the inability of phagocytic cells to kill certain bacteria and fungi due to a defect in the NADPH oxidase system. This system is essential for the production of reactive oxygen species that are necessary for the killing of microorganisms.

Left-sided chest findings may include abnormalities to auscultation, and chest radiographic findings may include an infiltrate or a left-sided pleural effusion.

Pseudomonas chondritis is strongly associated with puncture wounds through sneakers, which harbor Pseudomonas in the foam insole. S. aureus is the most common cause of chronic osteomyelitis. Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis is an autoinflammatory syndrome characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, bone pain, and radiographic findings of osteomyelitis. Bones uncommonly involved in acute hematogenous osteomyelitis such as the clavicle, scapula, or small bones of the hands or feet are often affected, pathogens are not identified on culture, and histopathology demonstrates plasmacytic infiltrates. Osteomyelitis may occur at any age but is most common in children 3 to 12 years of age and affects boys twice as frequently as girls. Osteomyelitis from penetrating trauma or peripheral vascular disease is more common in adults."

It is likely that the patient is experiencing a sepsis-like syndrome and has a systemic infection with a uropathogen that is resistant to the antibiotic that he has received. Pos-sible bacteria that may be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms are methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus sp., and enteric Gram-negative rods that are resistant to ciprofloxacin such as ESBL-positive E coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae, or other hospital-acquired Gram negative organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient was treated with vancomycin and meropenem, and blood and urine cultures were both positive for ESBL-positive E coli that was resistant to ciprofloxacin. The patient defervesced and hemodynamically stabilized over the subsequent 48 hours. ESBL-positive E coli is an emerging urinary tract pathogen that may be acquired"

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

            "content": "Beginning in the late 1980s, several reports described patients with GAS infections associated with shock and multisystem organ failure. This syndrome was called streptococcal TSS because it shares certain features with staphylococcal TSS. In 1993, a case definition for streptococcal TSS was formulated (Table 173-4). The general features of the illness include fever, hypotension, renal impairment, and respiratory distress syndrome. Various types of rash have been described, but rash usually does not develop. Laboratory abnormalities include a marked shift to the left in the white blood cell differential, with many immature granulocytes; hypocalcemia; hypoalbuminemia; and thrombocytopenia, which usually becomes more pronounced on the second or third day of illness. In contrast to patients with staphylococcal TSS, the majority with streptococcal TSS are bacteremic. The most common associated infection is a soft tissue infection\u2014necrotizing"

It was noted at operation that the appendix had perforated and there was pus within the abdominal cavity. The appendix was removed and the stump tied. The abdomen was washed out with warm saline solution. The patient initially made an uneventful recovery, but by day 7 she had become unwell, with pain over her right shoulder and spiking temperatures. This patient had developed an intraabdominal abscess. Any operation on the bowel may involve peritoneal contamination with fecal contents and fecal flora. This may not be appreciated at the time of the operation. Over the postoperative period an inflammatory reaction ensued and an abscess cavity developed, filling with pus. Typically, the observation chart revealed a \u201cswinging\u201d pyrexia (fever). The most common sites for abscess to develop are the pelvis and the hepatorenal recess."

Surgeons become involved when the patient develops infectious or obstructive complications.The nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction test is used to diagnose CGD. Normal neutrophils can reduce this com-pound, while neutrophils from affected patients do not, facili-tating the diagnosis via a colorimetric test. Clinically, patients develop recurrent infections such as pneumonia, lymphadenitis, hepatic abscess, and osteomyelitis. Organisms most commonly responsible are S. aureus, Aspergillus, Klebsiella, Serratia, or Candida. When CGD patients require surgery, a preoperative pulmonary function test should be considered since they are predisposed to obstructive and restrictive lung disease. Wound complications, mainly infection, are common. Sutures should be removed as late as possible since the wounds heal slowly. Abscess drains should be left in place for a prolonged period until the infection is completely"
