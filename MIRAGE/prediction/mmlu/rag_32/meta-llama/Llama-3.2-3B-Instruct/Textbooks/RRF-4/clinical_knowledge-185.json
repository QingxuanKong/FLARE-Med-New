For example, the cells of many cancers show grossly abnormal sets of chromosomes, with duplications, deletions, and translocations that are visible at mitosis (Figure 20\u201310). When the cells are maintained in culture, these patterns of chromosomal disruption can often be seen to evolve rapidly and in a seemingly haphazard way.

Why then do you suppose the Surgeon General has not yet issued an appropriate warning to heavy coffee and cola drinkers? A typical cup of coffee (150 mL) contains 100 mg of caffeine (196 g/ mole). How many cups of coffee would you have to drink to reach the dose (10 mM) required to interfere with the DNA damage response? (A typical adult contains about 40 liters of water.) 17\u201311 How many kinetochores are there in a human cell at mitosis? 17\u201312 A living cell from the lung epithelium of a newt is shown at different stages in M phase in Figure Q17\u20132. Order these light micrographs into the correct sequence and identify the stage in M phase that each represents."

            "content": "Cells can bypass this growth arrest if pRb and p53 are nonfunctional, but cell death usually ensues when the unprotected ends of chromosomes lead to chromosome fusions or other catastrophic DNA rearrangements. The ability to bypass telomere-based growth limitations is thought to be a critical step in the evolution of most malignancies. This occurs by the reactivation of telomerase expression in cancer cells. Telomerase is an enzyme that adds TTAGGG repeats onto the 3\u2032 ends of chromosomes. It contains a catalytic subunit with reverse transcriptase activity (hTERT) and an RNA component that provides the template for telomere extension. Most normal somatic cells do not express sufficient telomerase to prevent telomere attrition with each cell division. Exceptions include stem cells (such as those found in hematopoietic tissues, gut and skin epithelium, and germ cells) that require extensive cell division to maintain tissue homeostasis. More than 90% of human cancers express high levels"
