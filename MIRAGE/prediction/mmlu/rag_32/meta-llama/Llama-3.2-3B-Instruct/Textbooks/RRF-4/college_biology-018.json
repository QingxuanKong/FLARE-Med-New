    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the characteristics of retrotransposons as described in the provided documents. According to Document [1], retrotransposons are transposable elements that move via a mechanism that requires an RNA intermediate, which is then converted to DNA. This process involves transcription of the element into RNA, followed by reverse transcription of the RNA into DNA. This process is similar to the replication mechanism of retroviruses. In Document [7], it is stated that retrotransposons are characterized by the presence of an RNA copy that is used as a template for DNA synthesis. In Document [8], it is mentioned that retrotransposons are transcribed to RNA, which is used as a template for DNA synthesis by a reverse transcriptase encoded by the transposon. Therefore, the key characteristic of retrotransposons is that they replicate via an RNA intermediate. This matches option C. Options A and B do not accurately describe the mechanism of retrotransposons, as they do not involve an RNA intermediate. Option D is incorrect because while some transposons may use a protein intermediate, retrotransposons specifically use an RNA intermediate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Most transposons are only modestly selective in choosing their target site, and they can therefore insert themselves into many different locations in a genome. In particular, there is no general requirement for sequence similarity between the ends of the element and the target sequence. Most transposons move only rarely.

Splicing is indicated by lines connecting the exons that are included in the mRNA. 6\u20138 The human \u03b1-tropomyosin gene is alternatively spliced to produce different forms of \u03b1-tropomyosin mRNA in different cell types (Figure Q6\u20133). For all forms of the mRNA, the protein sequences encoded by exon 1 are the same, as are the protein sequences encoded by exon 10. Exons 2 and 3 are alternative exons used in different mRNAs, as are exons 7 and 8. Which of the following statements about exons 2 and 3 is the most accurate? Is that statement also the most accurate one for exons 7 and 8? Explain your answers. A. Exons 2 and 3 must have the same number of nucleotides. b. Exons 2 and 3 must each contain an integral number of codons (that is, the number of nucleotides divided by 3 must be an integer). C. Exons 2 and 3 must each contain a number of nucleotides that when divided by 3 leaves the same remainder (that is, 0, 1, or 2)."

            "content": "called long terminal repeats (LTRs). The ends of the retroviral RNA genome differ slightly in sequence from the integrated retroviral DNA. In the latter, the LTR sequences are repeated in both the 5\u2032 and the 3\u2032 terminus of the virus. The LTRs contain sequences involved in initiating the expression of the viral proteins, the integration of the provirus, and the polyadenylation of viral RNAs. The primer binding site, which is critical for the initiation of reverse transcription, and the viral packaging sequences are located outside the LTR sequences. The coding regions include the gag (group-specific antigen, core protein), pol (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase), and env (envelope) genes. The gag gene encodes a precursor polyprotein that is cleaved to form three to five capsid proteins; a fraction of the Gag precursor proteins also contain a protease responsible for cleaving the Gag and Pol polyproteins. A Gag-Pol polyprotein gives rise to the protease that is responsible for cleaving the"
