For relief of acute symptoms, inhalation of a short-acting \u03b2 agonist (eg, albuterol), of an anticholinergic drug (eg, ipratropium bromide), or of the two in combination is usually effective. For patients with persistent symptoms of exertional dyspnea and limitation of activities, regular use of a long-acting bronchodilator, whether an LABA or a long-acting anticholinergic, or the two together, is indicated. Theophylline may have a particular place in the treatment of COPD, as it may improve contractile function of the diaphragm, thus improving ventilatory capacity.

            "content": "Beta Agonists These provide symptomatic benefit. The main side effects are tremor and tachycardia. Long-acting inhaled \u03b2 agonists, such as salmeterol or formoterol, have benefits comparable to ipratropium bromide. Their use is more convenient than short-acting agents. The addition of a \u03b2 agonist to inhaled anticholinergic therapy has been demonstrated to provide incremental benefit. A recent report in asthma suggests that those patients, particularly African Americans, using a long-acting \u03b2 agonist without concomitant inhaled corticosteroids have an increased risk of deaths from respiratory causes. The applicability of these data to patients with COPD is unclear."

            "content": "Another approach to reducing the risk of long-term, twice-daily use of ICS is to administer them only intermittently, when symptoms of asthma flare. Taking a single inhalation of an ICS with each inhalation of a short-acting \u03b2-agonist reliever (eg, an inhalation of beclomethasone for each inhalation of albuterol) or taking a 5to 10-day course of twice-daily high-dose budesonide or beclomethasone when asthma symptoms worsen has been found to be nearly as effective as regular daily therapy in adults and children with mild to moderate asthma, although these approaches to treatment are neither endorsed by guidelines for asthma management nor approved by the FDA."

            "content": "Anticholinergics Muscarinic receptor antagonists such as ipratropium bromide prevent cholinergic nerve-induced bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion. They are less effective than \u03b22-agonists in asthma therapy because they inhibit only the cholinergic reflex component of bronchoconstriction, whereas \u03b22-agonists prevent all bronchoconstrictor mechanisms. Anticholinergics, including once-daily tiotropium bromide, may be used as an additional bronchodilator in patients with asthma that is not controlled by ICS and LABA combinations. High doses may be given by nebulizer in treating acute severe asthma but should only be given following \u03b22-agonists, because they have a slower onset of bronchodilatation. Side effects are not usually a problem because there is little or no systemic absorption. The most common side effect is dry mouth; in elderly patients, urinary retention and glaucoma may also be observed."

The most common side effects are muscle tremor and palpitations, which are seen more commonly in elderly patients. There is a small fall in plasma potassium due to increased uptake by skeletal muscle cells, but this effect does not usually cause any clinical problem. TOLERANCE Tolerance is a potential problem with any agonist given chronically, but although there is downregulation of \u03b22-receptors, this does not reduce the bronchodilator response because there is a large receptor reserve in airway smooth-muscle cells. By contrast, mast cells become rapidly tolerant, but their tolerance may be prevented by concomitant administration of ICS."
