    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option given in the context of the provided documents. Anticipation in genetics refers to the phenomenon where the symptoms of a genetic disorder become apparent at an earlier age or with greater severity as the disorder is transmitted from one generation to the next. This typically occurs in conditions caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions. Let's examine each option in light of this definition and the provided documents.\\n\\nA. Huntington disease - This is caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene. However, the question specifically asks about anticipation in paternal transmission, and Huntington disease does not show anticipation in this manner. It does show anticipation in terms of the age of onset, but this is not limited to paternal transmission.\\n\\nB. Marfan syndrome - This is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene. The documents do not suggest that Marfan syndrome exhibits anticipation in paternal transmission.\\n\\nC. Cystic fibrosis - This is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. The documents do not mention anticipation in paternal transmission for cystic fibrosis.\\n\\nD. Fragile X syndrome - This is an X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the FMR1 gene. The documents mention that Fragile X syndrome exhibits anticipation, and this is specifically noted in the context of paternal transmission. The size of the CGG repeat expansion increases with each successive generation, leading to earlier onset and more severe symptoms. This is a classic example of anticipation in paternal transmission.\\n\\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is D. Fragile X syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Parental history and experiences-paternal and maternal-can exert efects through epigenomic information not contained in the DNA sequence. Examples include variations in sperm and oocyte cytosine methylation and other mechanisms (Cedars, 2015; Lane, 2014). Perhaps one example is the possible link between increasing paternal age and complex neuropsychiatric conditions (Malaspina, 2015). Finally, the incidence of genetic diseases in ofspring caused by new autosomal-dominant mutations in older men is increased. Still, the incidence is low (Chap. 13, p. 265). Accordingly, targeted sonographic examination performed solely for advanced maternal or paternal age is controversial."

The former two entities, often traced through multiple generations, have an inheritance pattern consistent with genetic imprinting. The phenomenon of gene imprinting, involving methylation of genetic loci, independent of any mutation, impairs transcription from either the maternal or the paternal allele (Chap. 82). The Gs\u03b1 transcript is biallelically expressed in most tissues; expression from paternal allele is silenced through as-of-yet unknown mechanisms in some tissues including the proximal renal tubules and the thyroid; consequently, inheritance of a defective paternal allele has no implications with regard to hormonal function. Thus, females affected by either PHP-Ia or PPHP will have offspring with PHP-Ia, if these children inherit the allele carrying the GNAS mutation; in contrast, if the mutant allele is inherited from a male affected by either"

Normal alleles contain 11 to 34 copies of the repeat; in disease-causing alleles, the number of repeats is increased, sometimes into the hundreds. There is a strong genotype-phenotype correlation, with larger numbers of repeats resulting in earlier-onset disease. Once the symptoms appear, however, the course of the illness is not affected by repeat length. Further expansions of the CAG (glutamine-encoding) repeats occur during spermatogenesis, so paternal transmission may be associated with earlier onset in the next generation, a phenomenon referred to as anticipation (Chapter 7). HD appears to be caused by a toxic gain-of-function related to the expanded polyglutamine tract in huntingtin."

However, the incidence of autosomal dominant diseases, such as achondroplasia, polyposis coli, Marfan\u2019s syndrome, and Apert\u2019s syndrome, increases in the offspring of men who are advanced in age, consistent with transmission of sporadic missense mutations.

There are, however, important exceptions to this rule. X-inactivation prevents the expression of most genes on one of the two X chromosomes in every cell of a female. Gene inactivation through genomic imprinting occurs on selected chromosomal regions of autosomes and leads to inheritable preferential expression of one of the parental alleles. It is of pathophysiologic importance in disorders where the transmission of disease is dependent on the sex of the transmitting parent and, thus, plays an important role in the expression of certain genetic disorders. Two classic examples are the Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman\u2019s syndrome (Chap. 83e).

De novo germline mutations occur more frequently during later cell divisions in gametogenesis, which explains why siblings are rarely affected. As noted before, new germline mutations occur more frequently in fathers of advanced age. For example, the average age of fathers with new germline mutations that cause Marfan\u2019s syndrome is ~37 years, whereas fathers who transmit the disease by inheritance have an average age of ~30 years."

            "content": "Figure 24\u201337 Human MHC genes. This simplified schematic drawing shows the location of the genes that encode the transmembrane subunits of class I (light green) and class II (dark green) Mhc proteins. The genes shown encode three types of class I Mhc proteins (hLA-A, hLA-B, and hLA-c) and three types of class II Mhc proteins (hLA-Dp, hLA-DQ, and hLA-Dr). An individual can therefore make six types of class I Mhc proteins (three encoded by maternal genes and three by paternal genes) and more than six types of class II Mhc proteins. Because of the extreme polymorphism of the Mhc genes, the chances are very low that the maternal and paternal alleles will be the same. The number of class II Mhc proteins that can be made is greater than six because there are two DR \u03b2 genes and because maternally encoded and paternally encoded polypeptide chains can sometimes pair. The entire region shown spans about seven million base pairs and contains other genes that are not shown."

            "content": "Exceptions to Simple Mendelian Inheritance Patterns \u2022 mitocHonDrial DisorDers Mendelian inheritance refers to the transmission of genes encoded by DNA contained in the nuclear chromosomes. In addition, each mitochondrion contains several copies of a small circular chromosome (Chap. 85e). The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is ~16.5 kb and encodes transfer and ribosomal RNAs and 13 core proteins that are components of the respiratory chain involved in oxidative phosphorylation and ATP generation. The mitochondrial genome does not recombine and is inherited through the maternal line because sperm does not contribute significant cytoplasmic components to the zygote. A noncoding region of the mitochondrial chromosome, referred to as D-loop, is highly polymorphic. This property, together with the absence of mtDNA recombination, makes it a valuable tool for studies tracing human migration and evolution, and it is also used for specific forensic applications."

From 30% to 50% of carrier women with the fragile X mutation on one chromosome might show features of mild cognitive impairment or other behavioral disturbances. Approximately 20% develop features of premature reproductive failure (see below). The presence of symptoms in carrier females, albeit mild, is unusual for an X-linked recessive disease. Anticipation. This term refers to the phenomenon whereby clinical features of fragile X syndrome worsen with each successive generation, as if the mutation becomes increasingly deleterious as it is transmitted from a man to his grandsons and great-grandsons."

A subsequent nondisjunction, with loss of the paternal chromosome (represented in blue), restores the diploid karyotype but leaves two copies of the maternal chromosome (maternal uniparental disomy [UPD]). Panel B demonstrates nondisjunction in one parent (mother, indicated by red oval), resulting in only one copy of this chromosome in the zygote. Subsequent nondisjunction duplicates the single chromosome, rescuing the monosomy, but resulting in two copies of the paternal chromosome (represented in blue; paternal UPD)."
