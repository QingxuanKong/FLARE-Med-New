Double fertilization is a unique feature of flowering plants, where two fertilization events occur in the same plant. The first sperm fertilizes the egg to form a zygote, while the second sperm fertilizes the two polar nuclei to form the endosperm. Therefore, the correct answer is related to the second sperm's action, which is not the formation of the embryo (C) or the megagametophyte (A), but rather the formation of the endosperm (D).

The cells of these organisms are generally diploid: that is, they contain two slightly different copies, or homologs, of each chromosome, one from each parent. Sexual reproduction depends on a specialized nuclear division process called meiosis, which produces haploid cells carrying only a single copy of each chromosome. In many organisms, the haploid cells differentiate into specialized reproductive cells called gametes\u2014eggs and sperm in most species. In these species, the reproductive cycle ends when a sperm and egg fuse to form a diploid zygote, which has the potential to form a new individual. In this section, we consider the basic mechanisms and regulation of meiosis, with an emphasis on how they compare with those of mitosis. meiosis Includes Two Rounds of Chromosome segregation"

In these organisms, the egg cell contributes much more cytoplasm to the zygote than does the male gamete (sperm in animals, pollen in plants). For example, a typical human oocyte contains about 100,000 copies of maternal mitochondrial DNA, whereas a sperm cell contains only a few. In addition, an active process ensures that the sperm mitochondria do not compete with those in the egg. As sperm mature, the DNA is degraded in their mitochondria. Sperm mitochondria are also specifically recognized then eliminated from the fertilized egg cell by autophagy in very much the same way that damaged mitochondria are removed (by ubiquitylation followed by delivery to lysosomes, as discussed in Chapter 13). Because of these two processes, the mitochondrial inheritance in both animals and plants is uniparental. More precisely, the mitochondrial DNA passes from one generation to the next by maternal inheritance."

Development of Multicellular Organisms 21 An animal or plant starts its life as a single cell\u2014a fertilized egg, or zygote. During development, this cell divides repeatedly to produce many different kinds of cells, arranged in a final pattern of spectacular complexity and precision. The goal of developmental cell biology is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that direct this amazing transformation (Movie 21.1)."

Step 5: The signaling cascade activates the exocytosis of enzyme-filled vesicles called cortical granules that reside in the outermost, or cortical, region of the unfertilized egg. The enzymes contained in the cortical granules are released to the outside of the egg upon exocytosis. These enzymes modify both ZP2 and ZP3 of the zona pellucida such that ZP2 can no longer bind acrosomereacted sperm, and ZP3 can no longer bind capacitated acrosome-intact sperm. Thus only one sperm usually enters the egg. Occasionally, more than one sperm does enter the egg. This results in a triploid cell that is unable to develop further. Therefore prevention of polyspermy is critical for normal development of the fertilized egg."
