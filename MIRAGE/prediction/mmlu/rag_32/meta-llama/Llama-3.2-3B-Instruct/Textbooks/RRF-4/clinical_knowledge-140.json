The conclusions that can be drawn from such different types of studies can be summarized as follows. Basic research is designed to answer specific, usually single, questions under tightly controlled laboratory conditions, eg, does drug x inhibit enzyme y? The basic question may then be extended, eg, if drug x inhibits enzyme y, what is the concentra-tion-response relationship? Such experiments are usually repro-ducible and often lead to reliable insights into the mechanism of the drug\u2019s action. First-in-human studies include phase 1\u20133 trials. Once a drug receives FDA approval for use in humans, case reports and case series consist of observations by clinicians of the effects of drug (or other) treatments in one or more patients.

The actions of the drug on the body are termed pharmacodynamic processes (Figure 1\u20131); the principles of pharmacodynamics are presented in greater detail in Chapter 2. These properties determine the group in which the drug is classified, and they play the major role in deciding whether that group is appropriate therapy for a particular symptom or disease. The actions of the body on the drug are called pharmacokinetic processes and are described in Chapters 3 and 4. Pharmacokinetic processes govern the absorption, distribution, and elimination of drugs and are of great practical importance in the choice and administration of a particular drug for a particular patient, eg, a patient with impaired renal function. The following paragraphs provide a brief introduction to pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics."

Guanethidine commonly causes diarrhea, which results from increased gastrointestinal motility due to parasympathetic predominance in controlling the activity of intestinal smooth muscle. Interactions with other drugs may complicate guanethidine therapy. Sympathomimetic agents, at doses available in over-thecounter cold preparations, can produce hypertension in patients taking guanethidine. Similarly, guanethidine can produce hypertensive crisis by releasing catecholamines in patients with pheochromocytoma.

For this, many poison control centers use the nomogram established by Rumack and Matthew (1975). A plasma level is measured 4 hours after ingestion, and if the level is > 150 1g/mL, treatment is given (Smilkstein, 1988). If plasma determinations are not available, empirical treatment is given if the ingested amount exceeded 7.5 g. An oral loading dose of 140 mg/kg of N-acetylcysteine is followed by 17 maintenance doses of 70 mg/kg every 4 hours for 72 hours of total treatment time. Both the oral and an equally eicacious IV dosing regimen have been reviewed by Hodgman and Garrard (2012). he drug has been reported to reach therapeutic concentrations in the fetus (Wiest,"
