Mutational analysis may initially focus on a panel of mutations that are particularly frequent (often taking the ethnic background of the patient into account), but a negative result does not exclude the presence of a mutation elsewhere in the gene. One should also be aware that mutational analyses generally focus on the coding region of a gene without considering regulatory and intronic regions.

As discussed above, a typical gene carries in its linear sequence of nucleotides the information for the linear sequence of the amino acids of a protein. Only about 1300 nucleotide pairs are required to encode a protein of average size (about 430 amino acids in humans). Most of the remaining sequence in a gene consists of long stretches of noncoding DNA that interrupt the relatively short segments of DNA that code for protein. As will be discussed in detail in Chapter 6, the coding sequences are called exons; the intervening (noncoding) sequences in genes are called introns (see Figure 4\u201315 and Table 4\u20131). The majority of human genes thus consist of a long string of alternating exons and introns, with most of the gene consisting of introns.

Although it is possible to search genomes for splicing signals and other features that help to identify exons (codon bias, for example), one of the most powerful methods is simply to sequence the total RNA produced from the genome in living cells. As can be seen in Figure 7\u20133, this RNA-seq information, when mapped onto the genome sequence, can be used to accurately locate all the introns and exons of even complex genes. By sequencing total RNA from different cell types, it is also possible to identify cases of alternative splicing (see Figure 6\u201326)."

Acidosis decreases the solubility of HbS. B. Acidosis increases the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. C. Acidosis favors the conversion of hemoglobin from the taut to the relaxed conformation. D. Acidosis shifts the oxygen-dissociation curve to the left. E. Acidosis decreases the ability of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate to bind to hemoglobin. Correct answer = A. HbS is significantly less soluble in the deoxygenated form, compared with oxyhemoglobin S. Decreased pH (acidosis) causes the oxygen-dissociation curve to shift to the right, indicating decreased oxygen affinity (increased delivery). This favors the formation of the deoxy, or taut, form of hemoglobin and can precipitate a sickle cell crisis. The binding of 2,3bisphosphoglycerate is increased, because it binds only to the deoxy form of hemoglobin."

Blood is drawn for clinical laboratory tests. Prognosis: Patients treated with the appropriate antibiotic in the early stages of Lyme disease typically recover quickly and completely. Case-Related Questions: Choose the ONE best answer. Q1. Antibiotics in the tetracycline class inhibit protein synthesis (translation) at the initiation step. Which of the following statements about translation is correct? A. In eukaryotic translation, the initiating amino acid is formylated methionine. B. Only the charged initiating transfer RNA goes directly to the ribosomal A site. C. Peptidyltransferase is a ribozyme that forms the peptide bond between two amino acids. D. Prokaryotic translation can be inhibited by the phosphorylation of initiation factor 2."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a two-tier testing procedure for Lyme disease that involves a screening enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by a confirmatory western blot analysis on any sample with a positive or equivocal ELISA result. Which of the following statements about these testing procedures is correct? A. Both techniques are used to detect specific mRNA. B. Both techniques involve the use of antibodies. C. ELISA requires the use of electrophoresis."

            "content": "In some cases, alternative RNA splicing occurs because there is an intron sequence ambiguity: the standard spliceosome mechanism for removing intron sequences (discussed in Chapter 6) is unable to distinguish clearly between two or more alternative pairings of 5\u02b9 and 3\u02b9 splice sites, so that different choices are made by chance on different individual transcripts. Where such constitutive alternative splicing occurs, several versions of the protein encoded by the gene are made in all cells in which the gene is expressed."

Diagnosis can be made by measuring the level of glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood. B. During periods of physiologic stress, the urine of an individual with T1D would likely test negative for reducing sugars. C. T1D is associated with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. D. The characteristic metabolic abnormalities seen in T1D result from insensitivity to both insulin and glucagon. E. Treatment with exogenous insulin allows normalization of blood glucose (euglycemia). RQ2. DKA occurs when the rate of ketone body production is greater than the rate of utilization. Which of the following statements concerning ketone body metabolism is correct? Ketone bodies: A. are made in mitochondria from acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) primarily produced by the oxidation of glucose. B. are utilized by many tissues, particularly the liver, after conversion to acetyl CoA."
