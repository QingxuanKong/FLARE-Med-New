The corresponding motif in the DNA sequence is called a \u201chomeobox,\u201d from which, by abbreviation, the Hox complex takes its name. There are many homeobox-containing genes, but only those located in a Hox complex are Hox genes. The Hox proteins can be viewed as molecular address labels possessed by the cells of each segment: these labels give the cells in each region a positional value\u2014that is, an intrinsic character that differs according to a cell\u2019s location. If the address labels in a developing Drosophila segment are changed, the segment behaves as though it were located somewhere else; if all the Hox genes in an embryo are deleted, the body segments in the larva will all be alike."

Thus, it is often possible to predict the function of genes in humans for which no biochemical or genetic information is available simply by comparing their nucleotide sequences with the sequences of genes that have been characterized in other more readily studied organisms. In general, the sequences of individual genes are much more tightly conserved than is overall genome structure. Features of genome organization such as genome size, number of chromosomes, order of genes along chromosomes, abundance and size of introns, and amount of repetitive DNA are found to differ greatly when comparing distant organisms, as does the number of genes that each organism contains."

This is one of the genes that remain active in both X chromosomes and is unique in having an active homologue on the short arm of the Y chromosome. Thus, both normal males and females have two active copies of this gene. Loss of one copy of SHOX gives rise to short stature. Indeed, deletions of the SHOX gene are noted in 2% to 5% of otherwise normal children with short stature. Whereas loss of one copy of SHOX can explain the growth deficit in Turner syndrome, it cannot explain other important clinical features such as cardiac malformations and endocrine abnormalities.

The globin and the immunoglobulin genes, for example, contain locus control regions that are several kilobases away from the structural sequences of the gene. Specific groups of transcription factors that bind to these promoter and enhancer sequences provide a combinatorial code for regulating transcription. In this manner, relatively ubiquitous factors interact with more restricted factors to allow each gene to be expressed and regulated in a unique manner that is dependent on developmental state, cell type, and numerous extracellular stimuli. Regulatory factors also bind within the gene itself, particularly in the intronic regions. The transcription factors that bind to DNA actually represent only the first level of regulatory control. Other proteins\u2014co-activators and co-repressors\u2014interact with the DNA-binding transcription factors to generate large regulatory complexes. These complexes are subject to control by numerous"

The consensus sequence, shown below the graph, reflects the most common nucleotide found at each position in the collection of promoters. These promoters are characterized by two hexameric DNA sequences\u2014the \u201335 sequence and the \u201310 sequence, named for their approximate location relative to the start point of transcription (designated +1). The sequence of nucleotides between the \u201335 and \u201310 hexamers shows no significant similarities among promoters."
