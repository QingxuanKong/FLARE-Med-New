According to Document [1] (Gynecology_Novak), approximately 60% of abortuses lost before 8 weeks of gestation were reported to be chromosomally abnormal, with most of these pregnancies affected by some type of trisomy, particularly trisomy 16. Additionally, Document [9] (Pathology_Robbins) states that 50% of first-trimester spontaneous abortions may have a chromosomal abnormality. Document [27] (Obstentrics_Williams) also mentions that trisomy 16 is the most common trisomy found with first-trimester losses and accounts for 16 percent of these losses. Therefore, the most common chromosome abnormality in first trimester spontaneous miscarriages is trisomy, specifically trisomy 16.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Among women with recurrent pregnancy loss who are age 35 or older, the aneuploidy rate is much higher (8). The majority of chromosomal abnormalities identified in miscarriages are autosomal trisomies and considered to result from maternal nondisjunction. Maternal age appears as a consistent and important risk factor for trisomy in the majority of studies. There are several options for patients who suffer from recurrent pregnancy loss who have an identified miscarriage due to trisomy. The first is to conceive again without any specific change in medical management, as these abnormalities are sporadic and unlikely to recur. Studies examining patients with recurrent pregnancy loss show that women who miscarry chromosomally abnormal conceptions are more likely to achieve a live birth with subsequent pregnancy"

Approximately 60% of abortuses lost before 8 weeks of gestation were reported to be chromosomally abnormal; most of these pregnancies are affected by some type of trisomy, particularly trisomy 16 (318,319). The most common single chromosomal abnormality is monosomy X (45X), especially among anembryonic conceptuses (320). Aneuploid losses are particularly prevalent among women with recurrent pregnancy loss who are over the age of 35 (8). Although somewhat controversial, the detection of aneuploidy in miscarriage specimens may be less when the couple experiencing recurrent abortions is euploidic. Alternatively, some investigators have suggested that, because aneuploidy is common among miscarriage specimens from patients experiencing both isolated and recurrent spontaneous"

Fifty percent of spontaneous abortuses have chromosomal abnormalities, the most common being 45,X (TS); an estimated 99% of 45,X fetuses are spontaneously aborted. The fetal loss rate for DS, the most viable of the autosomal aneuploidies, approaches 80%. Most other chromosomal abnormalities also adversely affect fetal viability. In newborns and older children, features that suggest the presence of a chromosome anomaly include low birth weight (small for gestational age), failure to thrive, developmental delay, and the presence of three or more congenital malformations. During meiosis or mitosis, failure of a chromosomal pair to separate properly results in nondisjunction. Aneuploidy is a change in the number of chromosomes that results from non-disjunction. A cell may have one (monosomy) or three (trisomy) copies of a particular chromosome. Available @ StudentConsult.com"

PGD involves the removal of a single cell from an in vitro\u2013matured embryo. Genetic testing can be performed on this cell to examine chromosomal composition for the presence of single gene disorders (e.g., cystic fibrosis) or abnormalities in chromosome number and morphology. Embryos that are diagnosed with genetic abnormalities would be discarded and only those embryos with normal results would be considered appropriate for transfer into the uterus. Use of PGD in patients with known heritable genetic disorders (e.g., cystic fibrosis, X-linked disorders) is presently in widespread use in internationally recognized assisted reproductive technology centers."

Of chromosomal abnormalities, 95 percent are caused by maternal gametogenesis errors, and 5 percent by paternal errors Qacobs, 1980).

Abnormalities also may be detected upon parental karyotype analysis of some couples with a history of spontaneous abortions interspersed with stillbirths and live births (with or without congenital anomalies). Ultimately the use of parental karyotyping as a screening modality to evaluate the structural chromosomal etiologies of recurrent pregnancy loss may become insufficient.

            "content": "Other Trisomies. In the absence of mosaicism, discussed later (p. 263), other autosomal trisomies rarely yield a liveborn neonate. Case of live births with trisomy 9 and with trisomy 22 have been noted (Kannan, 2009; Tinkle, 2003). Trisomy 16 is the most common trisomy found with first-trimester losses and accounts for 16 percent of these losses. However, it is not identiied later in gestation. Trisomy 1 has never been reported. Nondisjunction creates an equal number of nullisomic and disomic gametes. As a rule, missing chromosomal material is more devastating than extra chromosomal material, and almost all monosomic conceptuses are lost before implantation. he one exception is monosomy for the X chromosome (45,X), Turner syndrome, which is discussed subsequently. Despite the strong association between maternal age and trisomy, maternal age and monosomy are not linked."

            "content": "Spontaneous Abortion Spontaneous abortion is a pathologic process resulting in unintentional termination of the pregnancy prior to 20 weeks\u2019 gestation. About 8% to 20% of known pregnancies terminate in spontaneous abortion (2,3). About 80% of spontaneous pregnancy losses occur in the first trimester; the incidence decreases with each gestational week (4\u20136). In women who had one prior spontaneous abortion, the rate of spontaneous abortion in a subsequent pregnancy ranges from 13% to 20%; in women who had three consecutive losses, the rate is 33% (7). Patients should be reassured that, in most cases, spontaneous abortion does not recur. In women less than 36 years of age, when fetal cardiac activity is confirmed by ultrasound, the risk of spontaneous abortion is less than 4.5%. For women older than 36, the risk of spontaneous abortion rises to 10%, and above 40 years may approach 30% (8). Risk factors for spontaneous abortion include increasing maternal age, closely spaced pregnancies"

            "content": "the optimal control group for a study of IVF PGD in the recurrent pregnancy loss population is debated. Should it be natural conceptions or IVF without PGD? Finally, the prognosis for a patient with recurrent pregnancy loss does seem to be linked to the chromosome analysis of prior miscarriages. Recurrent pregnancy loss patients who miscarry chromosomally abnormal embryos, seem to have better prognosis than those who miscarry chromosomally normal conceptions, again arguing for expectant management for recurrent pregnancy loss patients with a history of aneuploid loss. On the other hand, patients with poorer prognosis are those who miscarry chromosomally normal embryos and therefore would not benefit from PGD. The efficacy of PGD in the treatment of patients with recurrent pregnancy loss continues to be investigated, and the method of embryo biopsy and genetic testing continues to evolve (355,356). As these techniques improve and the understanding of aneuploidy and recurrence improves,"

Conlin CHROMOSOME DISORDERS Alterations of the chromosomes (numerical and structural) occur in about 1% of the general population, in 8% of stillbirths, and in close to 50% of spontaneously aborted fetuses. The 3 \u00d7 109 base pairs that 83e encode the human genome are packaged into 23 pairs of chromosomes, which consist of discrete portions of DNA, bound to several classes of regulatory proteins. Technical advances that led to the ability to analyze human chromosomes immediately translated into the revelation that human disorders can be caused by an abnormality of chromosome number. In 1959, the clinically recognizable disorder, Down syndrome, was demonstrated to result from having three copies of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21). Very soon thereafter, in 1960, a small, structurally abnormal chromosome was recognized in the cells of some patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and this abnormal chromosome is now known as the"
