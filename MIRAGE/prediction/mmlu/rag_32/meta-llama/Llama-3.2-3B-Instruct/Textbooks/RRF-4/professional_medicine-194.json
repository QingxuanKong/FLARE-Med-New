    "question": "A 16-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department by emergency medical technicians because of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that began 25 minutes ago and has continued despite administration of 0.5 mg/kg rectal diazepam 10 minutes ago. The patient was at home at the time of the seizure. In the emergency department, she is given an additional 0.5 mg/kg dose of diazepam intravenously and the convulsion terminates. Within 2 minutes, her oxygen saturation drops to 75% and she appears cyanotic. Respirations are 10/min and shallow. She receives bag-valve-mask ventilation, followed by intubation and mechanical ventilation. Medical history is unremarkable. She takes no medications. Temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F).

When the patient is first seen, an initial assessment of cardiorespiratory function is made and an oral airway established. As summarized by Bleck, a large-bore intravenous line is inserted; blood is drawn for glucose, BUN, electrolytes, and a metabolic and drug screen. A normal saline infusion is begun and a bolus of glucose is given (with thiamine if malnutrition and alcoholism are potential factors). To rapidly suppress the seizures, we generally use diazepam intravenously at a rate of about 2 mg/min until the seizures stop or a total of 20 mg has been given; alternatively, lorazepam, 0.1 mg/kg given by intravenous push at a rate not to exceed 2 mg/min, is now favored, being marginally more effective than diazepam because of its clinically longer duration of action (see Table 15-8)."

A similar effect has been attained by the nasal or buccal (transmucosal) administration of midazolam, which is absorbed from these sites (5 mg/mL, 0.2 mg/kg nasally; 2 mL to 10 mg buccally). Midazolam may be preferred among the diazepines for transmucosal use because it produces somewhat less respiratory depression than the others in the class and has been more effective at controlling seizures according to a study by McIntyre and colleagues. Still, only half were controlled. These approaches have found their main use in children with frequent seizures who live in supervised environments, where a nurse or parent is available to administer the medication."

The patient has signs of imminent respiratory failure, including her refusal to lie down, her fear, and her tachycardia, which can-not be attributed to her minimal treatment with albuterol. Critically important immediate steps are to administer high-flow oxygen and to start albuterol by nebulization. Adding ipratropium (Atrovent) to the nebulized solution is recom-mended. A corticosteroid (0.5\u20131.0 mg/kg of methylpred-nisolone) should be administered intravenously. It is also advisable to alert the intensive care unit, because a patient with severe bronchospasm who tires can slip into respiratory failure quickly, and intubation can be difficult. Fortunately, most patients treated in hospital emergency departments do well. Asthma mortality is rare (fewer than 4000 deaths"

            "content": "In an epileptic patient known to be taking seizure medications chronically but in whom the serum level of drug is unknown, it is probably best to administer the full-recommended dose of phenytoin. If it can be established that the serum phenytoin is above 10 mg/mL, a lower loading dose may be advisable. If seizures continue, an additional 5 mg/kg is indicated. If this fails to suppress the seizures and status has persisted for 20 to 30 min, an endotracheal tube should be inserted and O2 administered. Having emphasized the dangers of this syndrome, at each stage of treatment it is worthwhile considering if a refractory convulsive episode is of psychogenic, nonepileptic nature. The reader is referred to the previous section on this subject."

The frequency has been estimated to be approximately 4 per 1,000 children under the age of 5 but reportedly twice as high in Japanese children. It usually takes the form of a single, generalized motor seizure occurring as the patient\u2019s core temperature rises or reaches its peak. Seldom does the seizure last longer than a few minutes and by the time an EEG can be obtained, there is no abnormality and recovery is complete. The seizures do not recur during the same episode of fever. The temperature is usually above 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F)."

            "content": "First-line management of asthma exacerbations includes supplemental oxygen, repetitive, or continuous administration of short-acting bronchodilators. Early administration of oral or intravenous corticosteroids (Fig. 78-4) is important in treating the underlying inflammation. Administration of anticholinergic agents (ipratropium) with bronchodilators decreases rates of hospitalization and duration of time in the emergency department. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is given in the emergency department if there is clinical deterioration, despite treatment with \u03b22-agonists, ipratropium, and systemic glucocorticoids. The typical dose is 25 to 75 mg/kg (maximum 2.0 g) intravenously administered over 20 minutes. Epinephrine (intramuscular) or terbutaline (subcutaneous) is rarely used except when severe asthma is associated with anaphylaxis or unresponsive to continuous administration of short-acting bronchodilators."

In childhood, the most common causes of coma are toxins, infections, head trauma, hypoxia-ischemia (cardiac arrest, near-drowning), and seizure (postictal state, subclinical status epilepticus) (Table 184-1). The most common cause of long-term morbidity in a patient with depressed consciousness is hypoxia; therefore, airway, breathing and circulation are addressed first. Vital signs, including pulse oximetry, must be assessed. A glucose level should also be checked immediately because hypoglycemia is a rapidly treatable cause of altered mental status. Physical examination searches for clues as to the cause of altered consciousness, such as unusual odors, needle tracts, trauma, or signs of dehydration or organ system failure."

Breathing may be quiet or stertorous. This state persists for several minutes, after which the patient opens his eyes, begins to look about, and appears bewildered and is confused and may be quite agitated. The patient may speak and later not remember anything that has been said and undisturbed becomes drowsy and falls asleep, sometimes for several hours, then often awakens with a pulsatile headache. When fully recovered, such a patient has no memory of any part of the spell but knows that something has happened because of the strange surroundings (in ambulance or hospital), the obvious concern of those around him, and often, a sore, bitten tongue and aching muscles from the violent movements. The convulsive contractions, if violent enough, may crush a vertebral body or result in a serious injury; a fracture, periorbital hemorrhages,"
