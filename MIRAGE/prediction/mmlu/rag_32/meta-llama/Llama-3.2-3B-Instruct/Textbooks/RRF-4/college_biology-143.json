    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the symplastic pathway for the movement of sucrose from the site of photosynthesis in mesophyll cells into the phloem. The symplastic pathway refers to the movement of molecules through the symplast, which is the living cytoplasm of a plant cell, as opposed to the apoplast, which is the non-living space between cells. The process of loading sucrose into the phloem begins in the mesophyll cells of the leaves, where sucrose is produced through photosynthesis. The sucrose is then transported to the companion cells, which are specialized cells that have plasmodesmata, which are channels that connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. The companion cells then transport the sucrose to the sieve tubes, which are long, hollow tubes that make up the phloem. The sieve tubes are connected by plasmodesmata, allowing for the transport of molecules through the symplast. Therefore, the correct answer is the pathway that includes the companion cells, phloem parenchyma, fibers, and sieve tube. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The energized electron is passed rapidly to a quinone in the same protein complex, preventing its unproductive reassociation with the chlorophyll ion. This light-induced transfer of an electron from a chlorophyll to a mobile electron carrier is the central charge-separation step in photosynthesis, in which a chlorophyll becomes positively charged and an electron carrier becomes negatively charged (Figure 14\u201344).

            "content": "The elaborate series of reactions in which CO2 combines with ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate to produce a simple sugar\u2014a portion of which is used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate\u2014forms a cycle, called the carbon-fixation cycle, or the Calvin cycle (Figure 14\u201341). This cycle was one of the first metabolic pathways to be worked out by applying radioisotopes as tracers in biochemistry. As indicated, each turn of the cycle converts six molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate to three molecules of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate plus one molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, the three-carbon sugar produced by the cycle, then provides the starting material for the synthesis of many other sugars and all of the other organic molecules that form the plant. Sugars Generated by Carbon Fixation Can Be Stored as Starch or Consumed to produce atp"

            "content": "Chloroplasts have an extra membrane-enclosed compartment, the thylakoid. Many chloroplast proteins, including the protein subunits of the photosynthetic system and of the ATP synthase (discussed in Chapter 14), are located in the thylakoid membrane. Like the precursors of some mitochondrial proteins, the precursors of these proteins are translocated from the cytosol to their final destination in two steps. First, they pass across the double membrane into the matrix space (called the stroma in chloroplasts), and then they either integrate into the thylakoid membrane or translocate into the thylakoid space (Figure 12\u201326A). The precursors of these proteins have a hydrophobic thylakoid signal sequence following the N-terminal chloroplast signal sequence. After the N-terminal signal sequence has been used to import the protein into the stroma, a stromal signal peptidase removes it, unmasking the thylakoid signal sequence that initiates transport"

            "content": "The vacuole is important as a homeostatic device, enabling plant cells to withstand wide variations in their environment. When the pH in the environment drops, for example, the flux of H+ into the cytosol is balanced, at least in part, by an increased transport of H+ into the vacuole, which tends to keep the pH in the cytosol constant. Similarly, many plant cells maintain an almost constant turgor pressure despite large changes in the tonicity of the fluid in their immediate environment. They do so by changing the osmotic pressure of the cytosol and vacuole\u2014in part by the controlled breakdown and resynthesis of polymers such as polyphosphate in the vacuole, and in part by altering the transport rates of sugars,"

            "content": "14\u201312 In chloroplasts, protons are pumped out of the stroma across the thylakoid membrane, whereas in mitochondria, they are pumped out of the matrix across the crista membrane. Explain how this arrangement allows chloroplasts to generate a larger proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane than mitochondria can generate across the inner membrane. 14\u201313 Examine the variegated leaf shown in Figure Q14\u20133. Yellow patches surrounded by green are common, but there are no green patches surrounded by yellow. Propose an explanation for this phenomenon.
