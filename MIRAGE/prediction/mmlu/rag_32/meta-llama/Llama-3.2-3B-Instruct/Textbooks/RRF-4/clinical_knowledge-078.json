Let's examine each option one by one.\\n\\nA. Adrenaline: Adrenaline (also known as epinephrine) is a hormone that is released in response to stress, low blood glucose levels, or exercise. It has catabolic effects, including increasing glucose release from stored glycogen and promoting lipolysis (breakdown of fat). While adrenaline can increase glucose release, it does not directly promote glucose uptake by muscle cells. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\\n\\nB. Insulin: Insulin is an anabolic hormone that promotes glucose uptake and storage in muscle cells. It stimulates the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the cell surface, increasing glucose uptake in muscle cells. Insulin also promotes amino acid uptake and protein synthesis in muscle cells. Therefore, option B is correct.\\n\\nC. Glycogen: Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate stored in the liver and muscles. While glycogen can be broken down into glucose and used by muscle cells, it does not directly promote glucose uptake by muscle cells. In fact, glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen) is a catabolic process that releases glucose into the bloodstream, rather than promoting glucose uptake. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\\n\\nD. Cortisol: Cortisol is a hormone released by the adrenal gland in response to stress. It has catabolic effects, including increasing glucose release from stored glycogen and promoting lipolysis (breakdown of fat). Cortisol does not promote glucose uptake by muscle cells. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Insulin, which promotes glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle cells.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Glucagon, secreted by pancreatic alpha cells when blood glucose or insulin levels are low, stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis by the liver and renal medulla (Chap. 420). Postprandially, the glucose load elicits a rise in insulin and fall in glucagon, leading to a reversal of these processes. Insulin, an anabolic hormone, promotes the storage of carbohydrate and fat and protein synthesis. The major portion of postprandial glucose is used by skeletal muscle, an effect of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Other tissues, most notably the brain, use glucose in an insulin-independent fashion. Factors secreted by skeletal myocytes (irisin), adipocytes (leptin, resistin, adiponectin, etc.), and bone also influence glucose homeostasis."

RESTING SKELETAL MUSCLE Skeletal muscle accounts for ~40% of the body mass in individuals of healthy weight, and it can use glucose, amino acids, FA, and ketone bodies as fuel. In the well-fed state, muscle takes up glucose via GLUT-4 (for energy and glycogen synthesis) and amino acids (for energy and protein synthesis). In contrast to liver, there is no covalent regulation of PFK-2 in skeletal muscle. However, in the cardiac isozyme, the kinase domain is activated by epinephrine-mediated phosphorylation (see p. 100). Skeletal muscle is unique in being able to respond to substantial changes in the demand for ATP that accompanies contraction. At rest, muscle accounts for ~25% of the oxygen (O2) consumption of the body, whereas during vigorous exercise, it is responsible for up to 90%. This underscores the fact that skeletal muscle, despite its potential for transient periods of anaerobic glycolysis, is an oxidative tissue."

A primary way by which insulin promotes glucose tolerance is activation of glucose transporters in skeletal muscle. Insulin stimulates translocation of preexisting GLUT4 transporters to the cell membrane (reaction 1D). Insulin also promotes storage of glucose in muscle as glycogen (reaction 2D) and promotes oxidation of glucose through glycolysis (reaction 3D). During the fasting phase, low insulin results in a low number of GLUT4 transporters at the membrane (reaction 1F), so these cells consume less glucose (glucose sparing). Skeletal muscle fibers with mitochondria switch to the use of FFAs from adipocytes and KBs from hepatocytes (reaction 3F). Skeletal myocytes do not express glucagon receptors.

This is an energy-requiring (endergonic) pathway (both ATP and GTP get hydrolyzed) that occurs primarily in the liver, with the kidneys becoming major glucose producers in prolonged fasting. Gluconeogenesis uses both mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes and is stimulated by a fall in the insulin/glucagon ratio.

The recycling of lactate and pyruvate for gluconeogenesis is commonly referred to as the Cori cycle, which can provide up to 40% of plasma glucose during starvation (Fig. 2-15).Lactate production from skeletal muscle is insufficient to maintain systemic glucose needs during short-term fasting (simple starvation). Therefore, significant amounts of protein must be degraded daily (75 g/d for a 70-kg adult) to provide the amino acid substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis. Proteolysis during starvation, which results primarily from decreased insu-lin and increased cortisol release, is associated with elevated urinary nitrogen excretion from the normal 7 to 10 g/d up to 30 g or more per day.237 Although proteolysis during starvation occurs mainly within skeletal muscles, protein degradation in solid organs also occurs.In prolonged starvation, systemic proteolysis is reduced to approximately 20 g/d and urinary nitrogen excretion"

            "content": "Glucose sparing represents the other general process that contributes to maintenance of adequate circulating glucose levels during the fasting phase. Glucose sparing means the switching of fuel utilization from glucose to a nongluconeogenic fuel in most cell types, but especially in skeletal muscle, which represents the potentially largest single consumer of glucose. First, the uptake of glucose by skeletal muscle and adipocytes is greatly reduced because the GLUT4 transporter isoform exists in an intracellular CHAPTER 39 Hormonal Regulation of Energy Metabolism Fig. 39.3B) during the fasting phase. Thus alternative fuels need to be delivered to skeletal muscle and adipocytes. The nongluconeogenic fuels (i.e., cannot be used for gluconeogenesis by the liver) are FFAs and KBs. FFAs are Fig. 39.3B are also released after packaging of intrahepatic TGs into cussed later). KBs are produced by hepatocytes from acetyl CoA, which in turn originates from FFAs and ketogenic"

Metabolic Effects The first six amino acids at the amino terminal of the glucagon molecule bind to specific Gs protein\u2013coupled receptors on liver cells. This leads to an increase in cAMP, which facilitates catabolism of stored glycogen and increases gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis. The immediate pharmacological result of glucagon infusion is to raise blood glucose at the expense of stored hepatic glycogen. There is no effect on skeletal muscle glycogen, presumably because of the lack of glucagon receptors on skeletal muscle. Pharmacological amounts of glucagon cause release of insulin from normal pancreatic beta cells, catecholamines from pheochromocytoma, and calcitonin from medullary carcinoma cells.

The synthesis of glucokinase is repressed. Correct answer = A. The increased insulin and decreased glucagon levels characteristic of the absorptive state promote the synthesis of fructose 2,6bisphosphate, which allosterically activates phosphofructokinase-1 of glycolysis. Most covalently modified enzymes are in the dephosphorylated state and are active. Acetyl coenzyme A is not oxidized in the well-fed state because it is being used in fatty acid synthesis. Uptake of glucose (by glucose transporter-2) into the liver is insulin independent. Synthesis of glucokinase is induced by insulin in the well-fed state. 4.3.

            "content": "provision of exogenous glucose never has been shown to fully suppress amino acid degrada-tion for gluconeogenesis. This suggests that during periods of stress, other hormonal and proinflammatory mediators have a profound influence on the rate of protein degradation and that some degree of muscle wasting is inevitable. The administra-tion of insulin, however, has been shown to reverse protein catabolism during severe stress by stimulating protein synthe-sis in skeletal muscles and by inhibiting hepatocyte protein degradation. Insulin also stimulates the incorporation of ele-mental precursors into nucleic acids in association with RNA synthesis in muscle cells.In cells, glucose is phosphorylated to form glucose-6-phosphate. Glucose-6-phosphate can be polymerized during glycogenesis or catabolized in glycogenolysis. Glucose catabolism occurs by cleavage to pyruvate or lactate (pyruvic acid pathway) or by decarboxylation to pentoses (pentose shunt) (Fig. 2-22).Excess glucose from"
