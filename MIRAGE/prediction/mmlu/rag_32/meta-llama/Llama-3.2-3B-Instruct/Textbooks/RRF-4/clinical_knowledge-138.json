The most important protection against urinary tract infection is frequent and complete bladder emptying rather than avoiding the introduction of a foreign body into the bladder. Selfcatheterization allows the patient to accomplish this task using a small (14-Fr) plastic catheter that she inserts through the urethra into the bladder, draining its contents. The catheter is then removed, washed with soap and water, dried, and stored in a clean, dry place. Elaborate sterile procedures are not necessary. Bacteria are introduced into the bladder in this process, and the urine of women after self-catheterization regimens will always be colonized with bacteria; however, this condition should not be treated unless symptomatic infection occurs."

In the absence of anatomic abnormalities, recurrent infection in children and adults does not lead to chronic pyelonephritis or to renal failure. Moreover, infection does not play a primary role in chronic interstitial nephritis; the primary etiologic factors in this condition are analgesic abuse, obstruction, reflux, and toxin exposure.

Some patients with severe bladder dysfunction, particularly those with urinary retention, benefit from intermittent catheterization, which they can learn to do themselves and which lessens the constant risk of infection from an indwelling catheter. More often the problem is one of urinary urgency and frequency (spastic bladder), in which case the use of propantheline (Pro-Banthine) or oxybutynin (Ditropan) may serve to relax the detrusor muscle (Chap. 25).
