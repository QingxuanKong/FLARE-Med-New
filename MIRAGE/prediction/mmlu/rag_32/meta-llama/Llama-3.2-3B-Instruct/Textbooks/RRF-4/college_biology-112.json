    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of optimality theory in evolution and how it relates to the persistence of traits in a population. The optimality theory suggests that a trait will persist in a population if it provides a net benefit to the organism, i.e., if the benefits gained from the trait exceed the cost of the trait to the animal performing it. This theory is often represented by the idea that the trait with the best return for the cost relative to alternative forms of the trait will win out over the alternative forms. The optimality theory is not saying that beneficial traits are always worth the cost to the organism, but rather that the trait with the best trade-off between benefits and costs will be favored. This means that not all beneficial traits will persist in the genome if they are not cost-effective compared to alternative traits. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

There are finite resources available for the maintenance and repair of both germ and soma cells, so there must be a trade-off between germ cells (i.e., reproduction) and soma cells (i.e., longevity and aging). The soma cells are disposable from an evolutionary perspective, so they accumulate damage that causes aging while resources are preferentially diverted to the maintenance and repair of the germ cells. For example, the longevity of the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, is increased when its germ cells are ablated early in life. All of these theories assume that natural selection has negligible or negative influences on aging. Some postmodern ideas propose that aspects of aging might be adaptive and raise the possibility that evolution can act on the aging process in a positive way. These include the following:"

For example, as we saw earlier, they account for most of the DNA sequence differences between apes and humans. The spread of neutral mutations is not as rapid as the spread of the rare strongly advantageous mutations. It depends on a random variation in the number of mutation-bearing progeny produced by each mutation-bearing individual, causing changes in the relative frequency of the mutant allele in the population. Through a sort of \u201crandom walk\u201d process, the mutant allele may eventually become extinct, or it may become commonplace.

This is because there are 2N copies of the gene in the diploid population, and each of them has an equal chance of becoming the predominant version in the long run. For those mutations that do become fixed, the mathematics shows that the average time to fixation is approximately 4N generations. Detailed analyses of data on human genetic variation have suggested an ancestral population size of approximately 10,000 at the time when the current pattern of genetic variation was largely established. With a population that has reached this size, the probability that a new, selectively neutral mutation would become fixed is small (1/20,000), while the average time to fixation would be on the order of 800,000 years (assuming a 20-year generation time).

If the mutation has a significantly deleterious effect, it will simply be eliminated by purifying selection and will not become fixed. (In the most extreme case, the individual carrying the mutation will die without producing progeny.) Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population. Because humans reproduce sexually and genetic recombination occurs each time a gamete is formed (discussed in Chapter 5), the genome of each individual who has inherited the mutation will be a unique recombinational mosaic of segments inherited from a large number of ancestors.

More than this, and the probability that at least one critical component will suffer a damaging mutation becomes catastrophically high.

This genetic redundancy has allowed diversification and specialization of genes for new purposes, but it also makes biological mechanisms harder to decipher. For this reason, simpler model organisms have played a key part in revealing universal genetic mechanisms of animal development, and research using these systems remains critical for driving scientific and medical advances. Which statements are true? explain why or why not."
