The phalanges are the bones of the digits\u2014the thumb has only two; the rest of the digits have three (Fig. 7.94). The carpal bones and metacarpals of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers (metacarpals II to V) tend to function as a unit and form much of the bony framework of the palm. The metacarpal of the thumb functions independently and has increased flexibility at the carpometacarpal joint to provide opposition of the thumb to the fingers. The small carpal bones of the wrist are arranged in two rows, a proximal and a distal row, each consisting of four bones (Fig. 7.94)."

The distal portions of the radius and the ulna also articulate with each other. This joint allows the end of the radius to flip from the lateral side to the medial side of the ulna during pronation of the hand. The wrist joint is formed between the radius and carpal bones of the hand and between an articular disc, distal to the ulna, and carpal bones. The bones of the hand consist of the carpal bones, the metacarpals, and the phalanges (Fig. 7.7). The five digits in the hand are the thumb and the index, middle, ring, and little fingers. Joints between the eight small carpal bones allow only limited amounts of movement; as a result, the bones work together as a unit. The five metacarpals, one for each digit, are the primary skeletal foundation of the palm (Fig. 7.7)."

There are five carpometacarpal joints between the metacarpals and the related distal row of carpal bones (Fig. 7.94). The saddle joint, between metacarpal I and the trapezium, imparts a wide range of mobility to the thumb that is not a feature of the rest of the digits. Movements at this carpometacarpal joint are flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, rotation, and circumduction. The carpometacarpal joints between metacarpals II to V and the carpal bones are much less mobile than the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb, allowing only limited gliding movements. Movement of the joints increases medially, so metacarpal V slides to the greatest degree. This can be best observed on the dorsal surface of the hand as it makes a fist."

The flexor retinaculum is a thick connective tissue ligament that bridges the space between the medial and lateral sides of the base of the arch and converts the carpal arch into the carpal tunnel. The four tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus, the four tendons of the flexor digitorum superficialis, and the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus pass through the carpal tunnel, as does the median nerve (Fig. 7.98).

This is the most common primary benign bone tumor of the hand and wrist and is of cartilage origin. Up to 90% of all bone tumors in the hand and wrist are enchondromas, with 35% to 54% of all enchondromas occurring in the hand and wrist. They are often found incidentally on X-rays taken for other reasons (e.g., hand trauma). They are usually solitary and favor the diaphysis of small tubular bones and are most com-mon in the second and third decades of life. The most common location is in the proximal phalanges, followed by the metacar-pals and then middle phalanges. Enchondroma has never been reported in the"

The distal radius is fused, through the proximal and distal carpal rows to the third metacarpal, typi-cally with a dorsal plate and screws. Multiple long-term studies have shown excellent pain relief and durability; this comes at the cost of total loss of wrist motion. This is surprisingly well tolerated in most patients, especially if the other hand/wrist is unaffected. The only activity of daily living that cannot be done with a fused wrist is personal toileting.Rheumatoid ArthritisRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory arthritis that can affect any joint in the body.

The extensor digitorum communis (EDC) originates from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and extends the MP joints of the fingers.

Although the compartments end at the radiocarpal/ulnocarpal joints, the relative geography of the tendons is preserved over the carpal bones (see Fig. 44-3).In the hand, the pulleys maintain the long flexor tendons in close apposition to the fingers and thumb. There are no extensor pulleys within the hand. Each finger has five annular and three cruciate pulleys (Fig. 44-4). The second and fourth (A2 and A4) pulleys are the critical structures to prevent bowstringing of the finger.3 The remaining pulleys can be divided as needed for sur-gical exposure or to relieve a stricture area.VascularTwo major arteries serve the hand. The radial artery travels under the brachioradialis muscle in the forearm. At the junc-tion of the middle and distal thirds of the forearm, the artery becomes superficial and palpable, passing just radial to the FCR tendon.

The axilla, cubital fossa, and carpal tunnel are significant areas of transition between the different parts of the limb (Fig. 7.2). Important structures pass through, or are related to, each of these areas. The axilla is an irregularly shaped pyramidal area formed by muscles and bones of the shoulder and the lateral surface of the thoracic wall.

One prospective randomized series of scaphoid wrist fractures demonstrated shortening of time to union by up to 6 weeks in the surgically treated group, but no difference in rate of union.14 Surgery may be useful in the younger, more active patient who would benefit from an earlier return to full activity.Ligament injuries of the wrist can be difficult to recognize. Patients often present late and may not be able to localize their pain. In severe cases, the ligaments of the wrist can rupture to the point of dislocation of the capitate off the lunate or even the lunate off the radius. Mayfield and colleagues classified the progression of this injury into four groups.15 In the most severe group, the lunate dislocates off the radius into the carpal tunnel.

The capsule of each joint is reinforced by the palmar ligament and by medial and lateral collateral ligaments. The three deep transverse metacarpal ligaments (Fig. 7.95) are thick bands of connective tissue connecting the palmar ligaments of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the fingers to each other. They are important because, by linking the heads of the metacarpal bones together, they restrict the movement of these bones relative to each other. As a result, they help form a unified skeletal framework for the palm of the hand."
