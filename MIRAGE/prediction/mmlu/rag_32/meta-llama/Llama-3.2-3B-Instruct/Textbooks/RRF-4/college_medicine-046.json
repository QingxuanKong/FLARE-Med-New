The question asks which of the following would be a concerning sign during this evaluation. To answer this question, we need to consider the attachment theory and the attachment styles of the child. Attachment theory suggests that children form emotional bonds with their caregivers, and the quality of these bonds affects their emotional and social development. In this scenario, the mother is present and leaves for a short while, and then returns. A concerning sign would be a behavior that indicates the child is anxious or distressed when the mother is not present. The options can be evaluated as follows: A. Decreased exploration when the mother is out of the room - This could be a normal response, as children may be more cautious when they are alone. B. Crying and returning to the mother upon return - This is a concerning sign, as it indicates that the child is anxious or distressed when the mother is not present. C. Avoiding the mother upon return - This could be a normal response, as children may need time to process their emotions and may not want to interact with the mother immediately. D. Exploring the room before the mother leaves - This is a normal response, as children may be curious and want to explore their environment. Based on attachment theory, option B is the most concerning sign, as it indicates that the child is anxious or distressed when the mother is not present.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Timeout interrupts the behavior and immediately links it to an unpleasant consequence. This method requires considerable effort by the parents because the child does not wish to be isolated. A parent may need to hold the child physically in timeout. In this situation, the parent should become part of the furniture and should not respond to the child until the timeout period is over. When established, a simple isolation technique, such as making a child stand in the corner or sending a child to his or her room, may be effective. If such a technique is not helpful, a more systematic procedure may be needed. One effective protocol for the timeout procedure involves interrupting the child\u2019s play when the behavior occurs and having the child sit in a dull, isolated place for a brief period, measured by a portable kitchen timer (the clicking noises document that time is passing and the bell"

Rapport usually can be established quickly if the parents sense that the clinician respects them and is genuinelyinterested in listening to their concerns. The clinician develops rapport with the child by engaging the child in developmentally appropriate conversation or play, perhaps providingtoys while interviewing the parents, and being sensitive to thefears the child may have. Too often the child is ignored until itis time for the physical examination. Similar to their parents,children feel more comfortable if they are greeted by name and involved in pleasant interactions before they are askedsensitive questions or threatened with examinations. Youngchildren can be engaged in conversation on the parent\u2019s lap,which provides security and places the child at the eye levelof the examiner."

In particular they have explored sensorimotor performance in the first year and language and social development in early childhood. In the first 6 years of life, the infant and young child traverse far more ground developmentally than they ever will again in a similar period. From the newborn state, when the infant demonstrates a few primitive feeding and postural reflexes, there are acquired, within a few months, smiling and head and hand\u2013eye control; by 6 months, the ability to sit; by 10 months, the strength to stand; by 12 months, the muscle coordination required to walk; by 2 years, the ability to run; and by 6 years, mastery of the rudiments of a game of baseball or a musical skill. On the perceptual side, the neonate progresses, in less than 3 months, from a state in which ocular control is tentative and tonic deviation of the eyes"
