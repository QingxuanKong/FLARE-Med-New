    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the composition of ambient air and the process of gas exchange in the lungs. Ambient air is composed of approximately 21% O2, 79% N2, and 0.04% CO2. The partial pressure of a gas in a gas mixture is the pressure that the gas would exert if it occupied the total volume of the mixture in the absence of the other components. According to Dalton's law, the partial pressure of a gas (Pgas) is equal to the fraction of that gas in the gas mixture (Fgas) multiplied by the atmospheric (barometric) pressure (Pb). The partial pressures of the gases in air at sea level are as follows: PO2 = 0.21 * 760 mmHg, PN2 = 0.79 * 760 mmHg, and PCO2 = 0.04 * 760 mmHg. The partial pressure of O2 in the alveolus is given by the alveolar air equation (Eq. 23.13). This equation is used to calculate the AaDO2, a useful measurement of abnormal arterial O2. However, in normal conditions, the partial pressure of O2 in the alveolus is approximately equal to the partial pressure of O2 in ambient air, which is 0.21 * 760 mmHg. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a toxic gas that can be present in exhaled air, especially in cases of smoking or exposure to CO poisoning. However, its concentration is typically much lower than that of O2. Nitrogen (N2) is the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere and is present in the air we breathe. However, it is not typically exhaled in significant quantities. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a product of metabolism and is present in exhaled air. However, its concentration is typically much lower than that of O2. Considering these facts, we can conclude that oxygen (O2) is the substance found in greater quantity in exhaled air.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The patient is asked to first breathe normally into the spirometer, and the volume of air (the tidal volume [VT]) that is moved into and out of the lungs with each quiet breath is measured. The patient then inhales maximally and exhales forcefully and completely, and the volume of exhaled air is measured. The total volume of exhaled air, from a maximal inspiration to a maximal exhalation, is the vital capacity (VC). Residual volume (RV) is the air remaining in the lungs after a complete exhalation.

This is the Bernoulli effect, the same effect that keeps an airplane airborne, generating a lifting force by decreasing pressure above the curved upper surface of the wing due to acceleration of air flowing over the wing. If an individual tries to exhale more forcefully, the local velocity increases further and reduces airway size further, resulting in no net increase in flow. Under these circumstances, flow has reached its maximum possible value, or its flow limit. Lungs normally exhibit such dynamic airflow limitation.

Primary standards regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designed to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety exist for sulfur dioxide, particulates matter, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, lead, and carbon monoxide. Standards for each of these pollutants are updated regularly through an extensive review process conducted by the EPA. (For details on current standards, go to http://www.epa.gov/air/criteria.html.)"

This equation is used to calculate the AaDO2, a useful measurement of abnormal arterial O2. 4. The relationship between CO2 production and alveolar ventilation is defined by the alveolar carbon Eq. 23.14 ). There is an inverse relationship between the PACO2 and VA, regardless of the exhaled quantity of CO2. In normal lungs, PaCO2 is tightly regulated to remain constant at around 40 mm Hg."

            "content": "Fig. 21.2 ). To meet the changing metabolic needs of the body, gas exchange depends on the speed at which fresh gas is brought to the alveoli and the rapidity with which the metabolic products of respiration (i.e., CO2) are removed. Two major factors determine the speed at which gas flows into the airways for a given pressure change: the pattern of gas flow and the resistance to airflow by the airways. Patterns of Airflow There are two major patterns of gas flow in the airways\u2014 laminar and turbulent. Laminar flow is parallel to the airway walls and is present at low flow rates. As the flow rate increases and particularly as the airways divide, the flow stream becomes unsteady and small eddies develop. At higher flow rates the flow stream is disorganized and turbulence occurs."

OCCUPATIONAL FACTORS Several substances found in the workplace may act as sensitizing agents, as discussed above, but may also act as triggers of asthma symptoms. Occupational asthma is characteristically associated with symptoms at work with relief on weekends and holidays. If removed from exposure within the first 6 months of symptoms, there is usually complete recovery. More persistent symptoms lead to irreversible airway changes, and thus, early detection and avoidance are important."

Eotaxin (CCL11) is selectively attractant to eosinophils via CCR3 and is expressed by epithelial cells of asthmatics, whereas CCL17 (TARC) and CCL22 (MDC) from epithelial cells attract TH2 cells via CCR4 (Fig. 309-5). OXIDATIVE STRESS Activated inflammatory cells such as macrophages and eosinophils produce reactive oxygen species. Evidence for increased oxidative stress in asthma is provided by the increased concentrations of 8-isoprostane (a product of oxidized arachidonic acid) in exhaled breath condensates and increased ethane (a product of lipid peroxidation) in the expired air of asthmatic patients. Increased oxidative stress is related to disease severity, may amplify the inflammatory response, and may reduce responsiveness to corticosteroids."

Reductions in the FEV1 correlate with heightened risk of future attacks of asthma. Other possible markers of heightened risk are unstable pulmonary function (large variations in FEV1 from visit to visit, large change with bronchodilator treatment), extreme bronchial reactivity, high numbers of eosinophils in blood or sputum, and high levels of nitric oxide in exhaled air. Assessment of these features may identify patients who need increases in therapy for protection against future exacerbations."
