She has had similar episodes over the past 6 months. The symptoms improve following ingestion of orange juice or soft drinks. She says that she has had a great deal of stress. She has been drinking two alcoholic beverages daily for the past month; before this time, she seldom drank alcohol. Examination shows no abnormalities. Her serum glucose concentration is 30 mg/dL. Intravenous glucose is administered, and the patient's symptoms improve. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of hypoglycemia (nervousness, dizziness, palpitations, and excess perspiration) that improve with ingestion of orange juice or soft drinks. The serum glucose concentration is 30 mg/dL, which is significantly low. This suggests that the patient has a form of hypoglycemia that is not caused by an insulin-related issue, as insulin would likely elevate blood glucose levels. The patient's symptoms improve with glucose administration, indicating that the hypoglycemia is due to a lack of glucose in the blood. The most likely cause of this type of hypoglycemia is an excessive use of alcohol, which can cause a condition called alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA). In AKA, the liver is unable to produce enough glucose to meet the body's needs, leading to low blood glucose levels. The patient's symptoms of nervousness, dizziness, palpitations, and excess perspiration are consistent with the effects of hypoglycemia. The improvement of symptoms with glucose administration suggests that the patient has a form of hypoglycemia that is responsive to glucose replacement. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to measure the patient's blood glucose levels after glucose administration to confirm the diagnosis and assess the effectiveness of treatment. This would involve measuring the patient's serum glucose concentration after glucose administration, rather than measuring insulin or C-peptide levels, which would be more relevant if the patient's hypoglycemia were caused by an insulin-related issue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

Vasomotor symptoms (light-headedness, diaphoresis, palpitations, tachycardia, and syncope) predominate during this phase. This component of dumping is thought to be secondary to hypoglycemia from excessive insulin release. Dumping syndrome is most noticeable after meals rich in simple carbohydrates (especially sucrose) and high osmolarity. Ingestion of large amounts of fluids may also contribute. Up to 50% of postvagotomy and drainage patients will experience dumping syndrome to some degree early on. Signs and symptoms often improve with time, but a severe protracted picture can occur in up to 1% of patients."

With progressive lowering of blood glucose, the clinical picture is one of hunger, trembling, flushed facies, sweating, confusion, and, finally, after many minutes, seizures and coma. The diagnosis depends largely on the history, the documentation of reduced blood glucose during an attack, and reproduction of the patient\u2019s spontaneous attacks by an injection of insulin or hypoglycemia-inducing drugs (or ingestion of a high-carbohydrate meal in the case of reactive hypoglycemia). Fasting hypoglycemia suggests the presence of an insulin-secreting tumor (insulinoma). Acute hemorrhage, usually within the gastrointestinal tract, is a cause of weakness, faintness, or even unconsciousness when the patient stands suddenly. The cause (gastric or duodenal ulcer is the most common) may remain inevident until the passage of black stools."

            "content": "To avoid precipitating Wernicke disease, it has become standard practice in emergency departments to administer 100 mg or more of thiamine in malnourished or alcoholic patients if intravenous fluids that contain glucose are being infused. Magnesium is given as well because it is required as cofactor for thiamine activity. It is similarly advisable to give B vitamins to alcoholic patients who are seen for other reasons in the emergency department so as to raise body stores of thiamine and other vitamins. The patient with chronic alcoholism (or the nonalcoholic patient with persistent vomiting) exhausts thiamine in a matter of 7 or 8 weeks, during which time the administration of glucose may serve to precipitate Wernicke disease or cause an early form of the disease to progress rapidly. The further management of Wernicke disease involves the use of a balanced diet and all the B vitamins, as the patient is usually deficient in more than thiamine alone."

A 2-hour OGTT greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL (fasting sample, 60-, and 120-minute samples) after a 75-g load of glucose. A 2-hour OGTT should not be performed if the first two criteria are present. Diagnostic criterion for impaired glucose intolerance (IGT) is a fasting glucose greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL but less than 126 mg/dL (36). A 2-hour OGTT should be performed under the following conditions: 1. A 10-hour fast should precede morning testing. 2. The patient should sit throughout the procedure. Assessment of Glycemic Control 3. No smoking is permitted during the test interval. 4. Caffeinated beverages should not be consumed. 5. More than 150 g of carbohydrates should be ingested for 3 days before the test. 6. No drugs should be taken before the test."

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin.

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"
