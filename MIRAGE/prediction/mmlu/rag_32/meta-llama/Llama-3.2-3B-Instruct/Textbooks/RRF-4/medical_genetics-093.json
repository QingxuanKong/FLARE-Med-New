Twin studies are useful because they allow researchers to estimate the relative contributions of genetic and environmental influences on a trait. By comparing the similarities and differences between monozygotic (identical) twins and dizygotic (fraternal) twins, researchers can determine the proportion of variation in a trait that is due to genetic factors (heritability) versus environmental factors. This is because monozygotic twins share 100% of their genes, while dizygotic twins share on average 50% of their genes, allowing researchers to estimate the genetic contribution to a trait. This approach has been widely used in psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, and other complex diseases like type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia. The correct answer is A. they allow genetic as opposed to environmental influences on variation in a trait to be estimated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

A wealth of new information has been made possible by recent technological developments that have permitted affordable, large-scale genome-wide association studies and fine-scale sequencing. As an example, significant progress has been made in the genetics of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), which are a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental diseases that share clinical features of impaired reciprocal social communication and interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior. ASDs are highly heritable; concordance rates in monozygotic twins (~60\u201390%) are roughly 10-fold higher than in dizygotic twins and siblings, whereas first-degree relatives show about 50-fold increased risk compared with the general population.

Their genomes have the same sequence of nucleotides, and, obviously, many features of identical twins\u2014such as their appearance\u2014are strongly determined by the genome sequences they inherit. When their gene expression, histone modification, and DNA methylation patterns are compared, however, many differences are observed. Because these differences are roughly correlated not only with age but also with the time that the twins have spent apart from each other, it has been proposed that some of these differences are heritable from cell to cell and are the result of environmental factors. Although these studies are in early stages, the idea that environmental events can be permanently registered as epigenetic changes in our cells is a fascinating one that presents an important challenge to the next generation of biological scientists."

A study of elderly twins by McClearn and colleagues is further instructive; even in twins who were older than 80 years of age, a substantial part (an estimated 62 percent) of cognitive performance could be accounted for by shared genetic traits. These findings suggest that life experience alters intelligence, but in a modest way. There is therefore a strong suggestion that genetic endowment is the more important factor\u2014a view that was championed by Piercy and more recently by Herrnstein and Murray.

Women who were not a twin, but whose husbands were a dizygotic twin, gave birth to twins at a rate of 1 set per 116 pregnancies. Painter and associates (2010) performed genomewide linkage analyses on more than 500 families of mothers of dizygotic twins and identified four potential linkage peaks. he highest peak was on the long arm ofchromosome 6, and other suggestive peaks were on chromosomes 7, 9, and 16.

Namely, the division of one fertilized zygote into two does not necessarily result in equal sharing of protoplasmic material. Monozygotic twins may actually be discordant for genetic mutations because of a postzygotic mutation, or may have the same genetic disease but with marked variability in expression. In female fetuses, skewed lyonization can produce diferential expression of X-linked traits or diseases. Further, the process of monozygotic twinning is in a sense a teratogenic event, and monozygotic twins have a higher incidence of often discordant malformations (Glinianaia, 2008). For example, in one study of 926 monozygotic twins, the prevalence of congenital heart defects was 12-fold greater than the general population rate, but 68 percent of afected infants had a normal sibling (Pettit, 20l3).

Furthermore, in 2 additional sets of monozygotic twins who were clinically normal, lesions were detected by MRI. The concordance rate in dizygotic pairs is similar to that in nontwin siblings. Despite these provocative findings, no consistent pattern of mendelian inheritance has emerged. Of course, one must not assume that all diseases with an increased familial incidence are hereditary in that instances of the same condition in several members of a family may simply reflect an exposure to a common environmental agent. Paralytic poliomyelitis, for example, was about 8 times more common in immediate family members than in the population at large."

Moreover, the heritability of lifespan in human twin studies is estimated to be only 25% (although there is stronger hereditary contribution to extreme longevity). These two observations indicate that the cause of aging is unlikely to lie only within the DNA code. On the other hand, genetic studies initially undertaken in the nematode worm C. elegans and, more recently, in models from yeast to mice have shown that manipulating genes can have profound effects on the rate of aging. Perhaps surprisingly, this can often be generated by variability in single genes, and for some genetic mechanisms, there is very strong evolutionary conservation."

Quadruplets, for example, may arise from as few as one to as many as four ova.

Discordancy in monochorionic twins is usually attributed to placental vascular anastomoses that cause hemodynamic imbalance between the twins. Reduced pressure and perfusion of the donor twin can cause diminished placental and fetal growth. Even so, unequal placental sharing is probably the most important determinant of discordant growth in monochorionic twins (Lewi, 2013).

Also, women with twin pregnancies are often older and multiparous, qualities associated with lower rates of preeclampsia (Francisco, 2017). The incidence of pregnancy-related hypertension in women with twins is 20 percent at Parkland Hospital. In their analysis of 513 twin malformations, pregnancies complicated by stillbirth, and twin gestations with >25 percent discordance were also excluded. (Data from Dr. Don Mcintire.) pregnancies, Fox and coworkers (2014) identified 15 percent of parturients with preeclampsia. Another study compared 257 women with twins and gestational diabetes against 277 nondiabetic women carrying twins. hese researchers found a twofold greater risk of preeclampsia in women diagnosed with"

            "content": "Approximately 3\u20136% of any population may be susceptible to ARF, and this proportion does not vary dramatically between populations. Findings of familial clustering of cases and concordance in mono-zygotic twins\u2014particularly for chorea\u2014confirm that susceptibility to ARF is an inherited characteristic, with 44% concordance in mono-zygotic twins compared to 12% in dizygotic twins, and heritability more recently estimated at 60%. Most evidence for host factors focuses on immunologic determinants. Some human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles, particularly HLA-DR7 and HLA-DR4, appear to be associated with susceptibility, whereas other class II alleles have been associated with protection (HLA-DR5, HLA-DR6, HLA-DR51, HLA-DR52, and HLA-DQ). Associations have also been described with polymorphisms at the tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 locus (TNF-\u03b1-308 and TNF-\u03b1-238), high levels of circulating mannose-binding lectin, and Toll-like receptors."

            "content": "States continues to grow. Evidence acquired during and after World War II suggested that twinning correlated more with nutrition than with body size. Widespread undernourishment in Europe during those years was associated with a marked fall in the dizygotic twinning rate (Bulmer, 1959). Several investigators have reported a greater prevalence of twinning among women who have taken supplementary folic acid (Ericson, 2001; Haggarty, 2006). Conversely, in a systematic review, Muggli and Halliday (2007) were unable to demonstrate a significant association. Analysis of twinning rate in Texas after folic acid fortiication of cerealgrain products also failed to demonstrate an independent increase in twinning rates (Waller, 2003)."
