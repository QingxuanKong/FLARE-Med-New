This is not an example of sensory adaptation, but rather an example of neural adaptation.

When higher frequencies need to be encoded (e.g., the auditory system, which in humans is capable of detecting frequencies up to 20,000 Hz; see ), other strategies are needed. Other candidate codes depend on the spatiotemporal patterns of firing across populations of neurons. The duration and the onset and offset of events are encoded by different populations of sensory neurons. For example, slowly adapting receptors in the skin produce a repetitive discharge throughout a prolonged stimulus. However, rapidly adapting receptors produce spikes at the onset (or offset) of the same stimulus."

The impulse that is generated by a sensory ending is a graded one, not an all-or-none phenomenon like an action potential in nerve. This poorly understood peripheral generator determines the frequency of impulses in the nerve and to what degree the nerve response is sustained or fatigues. While anatomists have separated sensory receptors by morphology and physiologists classify them by the associated nerve fiber type as discussed below, there has been a trend to further separate receptors into low, or high-threshold type and to classify them by the rapidity of adaptation. Low-threshold receptors respond to weak and innocuous forces, and high threshold nerve endings are mainly nociceptive. The low-threshold ones show different patterns of adaptation depending on whether there is sustained firing during deformation (slowly adapting, mainly Merkel discs and Ruffini endings) or respond"

The nervous system has other capabilities, so-called integrative or higher functions, that are less directly tied to specific sensory modalities or motor behavior. These functions, in particular, require interactions between different parts of the cerebral cortex, and, as is being increasingly recognized, between the cerebral cortex and other parts of the brain. The neural basis for some of these higher functions is discussed in this chapter.

The normal means of activating the visual pathway is light striking the retina.

The receptive field of a sensory neuron is the region that, when stimulated, affects the activity of that neuron. For example, a sensory receptor might be activated by indentation of only a small area of skin. That area is the excitatory receptive field of the sensory receptor. Moreover, a neuron in the CNS might have a receptive field several times as large as that of a sensory receptor because it may receive information from many sensory receptors, each with a slightly different receptive field. The receptive field of that CNS neuron is thus the sum of the receptive fields of the sensory receptors that influence it. The location of the receptive field is determined by the location of the sensory transduction apparatus responsible for signaling information about the stimulus to the sensory neuron."

Warm and cold spots are those small areas of skin that respond most consistently to thermal stimuli with a sensation of warmth or cold. They found that a cold stimulus applied to a warm spot gave rise to a sensation of cold and that a noxious stimulus applied to a warm or cold spot gave rise only to a painful sensation; they also noted that mechanical stimulation of these spots gave rise to a sensation of touch or pressure. These experiments indicate that cutaneous receptors, some not distinguishable from each other on morphologic grounds, are probably endowed with only relative degrees of specificity, in the sense that each responds preferentially (i.e., has a lower threshold) to one particular form of stimulation."

In chemical signaling, adaptation enables cells to respond to changes in the concentration of an extracellular signal molecule (rather than to the absolute concentration of the signal) over a very wide range of signal concentrations. The underlying mechanism is negative feedback that operates with a short delay: a strong response modifies the signaling machinery involved, such that the machinery resets itself to become less responsive to the same level of signal (see Figure 15\u201318D, middle graph).

            "content": "21. Individual olfactory axons project to olfactory glomeruli, specific for each stimulus type, in the olfactory bulb. They synapse on the dendrites of mitral cells, which have reciprocal synapse with inhibitory interneurons. This synaptic organization in the glomerulus underlies stimulus adaptation and contrast enhancement. Squire L, Berg D. Fundamental Neuroscience. 4th ed. New York: Academic Press; 2012. Upon completion of this chapter, the student should be able to answer the following questions: 1. What is a motor neuron, and how are \u03b1 and \u03b3 motor neurons different? 2. What is a motor unit? How does the \u201csize principle\u201d apply to the orderly recruitment of motor units? 3. What is a reflex, and why are reflexes useful for clinical and scientific understanding? 4. What information about the state of the muscle is sensed by the muscle spindles, and what afferent fibers convey this information to the central nervous system (CNS)? 5."
