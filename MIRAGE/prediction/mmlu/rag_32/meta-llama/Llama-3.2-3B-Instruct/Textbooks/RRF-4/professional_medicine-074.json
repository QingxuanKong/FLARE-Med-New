On the second day after admission he developed a pneumothorax on the right side that required tube thoracostomy. An air leak is noted for the next 24 hours, which now has stopped. However, the patient has become restless and combative. Breath sounds are diminished in the right side of the chest and the patient now has tachycardia. Blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg.

The patient has become restless and combative, and the diminished breath sounds on the right side of the chest, tachycardia, and elevated blood pressure are all indicative of this condition. The STAT portable x-ray of the chest will likely confirm the diagnosis. The most appropriate step is to reposition the chest tube to ensure that the air leak is not obstructing the tube or causing further complications. This is a critical step in managing tension pneumothorax, as it can lead to cardiac arrest and death if not addressed promptly. The other options are not appropriate in this situation, as administering \u03b2-blocking medications or alprazolam may not address the underlying cause of the tension pneumothorax, and removing the patient from the ventilator and ventilating him with a bag-valve mask may worsen the situation by increasing the intrathoracic pressure and exacerbating the pneumothorax.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

If tension pneumothorax (absent breath sounds on the affected side in combination with shock and hypoxemia) is identified, immediate needle decompression is needed. This is accomplished by placing a 16to 18-gauge angiocatheter into the second intercostal space at the midclavicular line, followed by placement of a chest tube. If open pneumothorax is identified, an occlusive dressing must be applied immediately. This must be secured on three sides only to prevent the development of tension pneumothorax."

A large-bore needle should be inserted into the pleural space through the second anterior intercostal space.

The change in pH with Pco2 is 0.08 units/10 mmHg acutely and 0.03 units/10 mmHg in the chronic state. Knowledge of the arterial pH therefore allows the classification of ventilatory failure, defined as Pco2 >45 mmHg, into acute or chronic conditions. The arterial blood gas is an important component of the evaluation of patients presenting with symptoms of an exacerbation. An elevated hematocrit suggests the presence of chronic hypoxemia, as does the presence of signs of right ventricular hypertrophy."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."
