She is not in pain but is afraid to move her bowels for fear that the problem will worsen. She tells you that she moved away from home more than a year ago and that her parents contribute nothing to her support. She has a 6-month-old child and lives with a 28-year-old female cousin. She has never been married and does not work or attend school. She has no other symptoms. In order to follow the correct procedure for treating a minor, which of the following is the most appropriate step prior to evaluating this patient's rectal problem?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most appropriate step to take before evaluating a 15-year-old girl's rectal problem. The patient is afraid to move her bowels and is concerned that the problem will worsen. This suggests that she may be experiencing a rectal problem that requires medical attention. In pediatric care, the privacy and autonomy of minors are respected, but there are certain situations where evaluation and treatment are necessary. The patient is 15 years old, so she is considered a minor. According to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), minors must be informed and involved in medical decision-making to the extent possible. However, in emergency situations, minors can be evaluated and treated without their consent if a qualified healthcare provider determines that the situation is emergent and the patient's health and safety are at risk. In this case, the patient is afraid to move her bowels and may be experiencing a rectal problem that requires medical attention. Therefore, the most appropriate step is to evaluate her rectal problem without obtaining written consent from her parents or a court order. The healthcare provider should inform the patient of the purpose of the evaluation and the potential risks and benefits, and involve her in the decision-making process to the extent possible. The healthcare provider should also consider involving a parent or guardian if the patient is unable to make decisions for herself due to her age or cognitive impairment. In this case, the patient's mother is present and can provide support and guidance. However, the healthcare provider should still inform the patient of the evaluation and treatment plan and involve her in the decision-making process as much as possible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

Greater emphasis is placed on the late adolescent\u2019s responsibility for his or her health. A full pelvic examination is rarely required in a virginal adolescent girl. A bimanual rectal-abdominal examination (all midline internal genitalia are immediately anterior to the rectal wall) is as efficient as a vaginal-abdominal examination. In some girls, anesthesia may be required for a full pelvic examination. Before a pelvic examination, the patient should be informedabout the importance of the assessment and what maneuverswill take place; she should be encouraged to ask questionsbefore, during, or after the examination. A chaperone shouldbe offered when a family caregiver is not present. Assuringthe patient that she has complete control over the examination and allowing participating by using a mirror or guidingthe examiner is important. The examiner should maintain"

Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV.

Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age. A 35-year-old woman visited her family practitioner because she had a \u201cbloating\u201d feeling and an increase in abdominal girth. The family practitioner examined the lower abdomen, which revealed a mass that extended from the superior pubic rami to the level of the umbilicus. The superior margin of the mass was easily palpated, but the inferior margin appeared to be less well defined. This patient has a pelvic mass. When examining a patient in the supine position, the observer should uncover the whole of the abdomen."
