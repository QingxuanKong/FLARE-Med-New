In surviving cells, simple defects may be reparable by various enzyme repair systems contained in mammalian cells (see Chapter 6). These repair systems are linked to cell-cycle regulation through proteins such as ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) that initiate signal transduction after the damage, and p53, which can transiently arrest the cell cycle to allow for DNA repair or to trigger apoptosis of cells that are irreparable.

As discussed previously in the context of cellular aging (Chapter 2), most normal human cells have a capacity of at most 70 doublings. Thereafter, the cells lose the ability to divide and enter replicative senescence. This phenomenon has been ascribed to progressive shortening of telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. Markedly eroded telomeres are recognized by the DNA repair machinery as double-stranded DNA breaks, leading to cell cycle arrest and senescence, mediated by TP53 and RB. In cells in which TP53 or RB mutations are disabled by mutations, the nonhomologous end-joining pathway is activated in a last-ditch effort to save the cell, joining the shortened ends of two chromosomes."

DNA damage from these agents can occur in any cell cycle phase, but cells tend to arrest in S-phase or G2 of the cell cycle in cells with p53 and Rb pathway lesions as the result of defective checkpoint mechanisms in cancer cells. Owing to the role of topoisomerase I in the procession of the replication fork, topoisomerase I poisons cause lethality if the topoisomerase I\u2013induced lesions are made in S-phase."

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is mainly caused by UV light exposure, which leads to widespread DNA damage and extremely high mutational loads (Chapter 6). As one might imagine, patients with the rare disorder xeroderma pigmentosum, which disrupts repair of UV-induced DNA damage, are at an exceptionally high risk. TP53 mutations are common, as are activating mutations in RAS and loss-of-function mutations in Notch receptors, which transmit signals that regulate the orderly differentiation of normal squamous epithelia."

Briggs, MD A 45-year-old man with high-risk acute myelogenous leu-kemia undergoes high-dose chemotherapy followed by an allogeneic stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor. He receives tacrolimus and low-dose methotrexate as prophy-laxis for graft-vs-host disease. One month after blood count recovery, he develops a skin rash despite ongoing tacrolimus therapy. A skin biopsy confirms grade II acute graft-vs-host disease. How should this case be pharmacologically man-aged at this point?"

Meanwhile, cells also receive antiproliferative signals such as those from tumor suppressors. These antiproliferative signals also act in the G1 phase to stop cells\u2019 progress into the S phase by inducing CKI production. For example, when DNA is dam-aged, cells will repair the damage before entering the S phase. Therefore, G1 contains one of the most important checkpoints for cell cycle progression. If the analogy is made that CDK is to a cell as an engine is to a car, then cyclins and CKI are the gas pedal and brake, respectively.
