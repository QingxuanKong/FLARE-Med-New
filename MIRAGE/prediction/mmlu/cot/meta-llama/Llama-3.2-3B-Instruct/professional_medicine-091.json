    "question": "A randomized controlled trial is conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new combination-drug antihypertensive therapy (Drug X) compared with a standard antihypertensive single-drug therapy. Study participants include 140 women (70%) and 60 men (30%) ages 30 to 60 years, with baseline blood pressure measurements of 150/95 mm Hg or higher. The investigators defined antihypertensive therapy as effective if the treatment resulted in a blood pressure measurement below 140/90 mm Hg. When designing the study, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1%; they set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%. Which of the following is the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study?",

    "predict": "To determine the statistical power of the study, we need to calculate the effect size (d) and then use it to estimate the power. We can use the following formula to calculate the effect size (d): d = (\u03bc1 - \u03bc2) / \u03c3 where \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 are the means of the two groups, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the differences. Since the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1%, this means that the power of the study to detect a difference in the opposite direction (i.e., that Drug X is less effective than the standard therapy) is also 1%. We can use this information to estimate the effect size. The power of a two-sample t-test is given by: 1 - \u03b2 = 2 * \u03a6(d) where \u03a6 is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. We can rearrange this formula to solve for d: d = \u03a6^(-1) * (1 - 2 * \u03b2) where \u03a6^(-1) is the inverse cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Using a z-table or calculator, we can find that \u03a6^(-1) * (1 - 2 * 0.01) \u2248 2.33. Now, we need to calculate the effect size (d) for the study. Since the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%, we can use this information to estimate the effect size. The power of the study to detect a difference between the two groups is given by: 1 - \u03b2 = 2 * \u03a6(d) We can rearrange this formula to solve for d: d = \u03a6^(-1) * (1 - 2 * (1 - 0.1)) d = \u03a6^(-1) * (1 - 0.8) d = \u03a6^(-1) * 0.2 d \u2248 1.28 Now that we have the effect size (d \u2248 1.28), we can estimate the statistical power of the study. The power of the study is given by: 1 - \u03b2 = 2 * \u03a6(d) 1 - \u03b2 = 2 * \u03a6(1.28) 1 - \u03b2 \u2248 2 * 0.9 1 - \u03b2 \u2248 1.8 However, this is not the answer we are looking for. The power of the study is the probability of detecting a statistically significant difference between the two groups. Since we are interested in detecting a difference in either direction (i.e., Drug X is more effective or less effective than the standard therapy), we need to use the one-tailed test. The power of the one-tailed test is given by: 1 - \u03b2 = \u03a6(d) where \u03a6 is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Using a z-table or calculator, we can find that \u03a6(1.28) \u2248 0.9. Now, we can calculate the power of the study: 1 - \u03b2 \u2248 0.9 However, this is still not the answer we are looking for. We need to consider the sample size and the effect size. The effect size (d) is given by: d = (\u03bc1 - \u03bc2) / \u03c3 where \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 are the means of the two groups, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the differences. Since we don't know the standard deviation of the differences, we can use the standard error of the difference between the means: \u03c3 = sqrt((\u03c31^2 + \u03c32^2) / n) where \u03c31 and \u03c32 are the standard deviations of the two groups, and n is the sample size. We can estimate the standard deviation of the differences using the sample standard deviation: \u03c31 \u2248 10 mm Hg (assuming a normal distribution) \u03c32 \u2248 10 mm Hg (assuming a normal distribution) n = 140 (sample size) \u03c3 \u2248 sqrt((10^2 + 10^2) / 140) \u03c3 \u2248 sqrt(200 / 140) \u03c3 \u2248 sqrt(1.43) \u03c3 \u2248 1.2 mm Hg Now that we have the standard deviation of the differences, we can calculate the effect size (d): d = (\u03bc1 - \u03bc2) / \u03c3 d = (140/90 - 150/90) / 1.2 d = (1.56 - 1.67) / 1.2 d \u2248 -0.055 However, we are interested in the absolute value of the effect size, so: d \u2248 0.055 Now that we have the effect size (d \u2248 0.055), we can estimate the power of the study: 1 - \u03b2 = \u03a6(d) 1 - \u03b2 \u2248 \u03a6(0.055) 1 - \u03b2 \u2248 0.536 However, this is still not the answer we are looking for. We need to consider the sample size and the effect size. The power of the study is given by: 1 - \u03b2 = \u03a6(d / sqrt(n)) where \u03a6 is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, d is the effect size, and n is the sample size. Rearranging the formula to solve for the power: 1 - \u03b2 = \u03a6(d / sqrt(n)) 1 - \u03b2 = \u03a6(0.055 / sqrt(140)) 1 - \u03b2 \u2248 \u03a6(0.039) Using a z-table or calculator, we can find that \u03a6(0.039) \u2248 0.52 However, this is still not the answer we are looking for. We need to consider the sample size and the effect size. The power of the study is given by: 1 - \u03b2 = \u03a6(d / sqrt(n)) Rearranging the formula to solve for the power: 1 - \u03b2 = \u03a6(d / sqrt(n)) 1 - \u03b2 \u2248 \u03a6(0.055 / sqrt(140)) 1 - \u03b2 \u2248 \u03a6(0.055 / 11.83) 1 - \u03b2 \u2248 \u03a6(0.0047) 1 - \u03b2 \u2248 0.9973 However, this is still not the answer we are looking for. We need to consider the sample size and the effect size. The power of the study is given by: 1 - \u03b2 = \u03a6(d / sqrt(n)) Rearranging the formula to solve for the power: 1 - \u03b2 = \u03a6(d / sqrt(n)) 1 - \u03b2 \u2248 \u03a6(0.055 / sqrt(140)) 1 - \u03b2 \u2248 \u03a6(0.0047) 1 - \u03b2 \u2248 0.9973 However, we are looking for the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study. Since the power is very close to 1, we can assume that the power is close to 100%. Therefore, the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To estimate the statistical power of the study, we calculated the effect size (d) and then used it to estimate the power.

The power of the study is given by: 1 - \u03b2 = \u03a6(d / sqrt(n)) where \u03a6 is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, d is the effect size, and n is the sample size. In this case, the effect size (d) is small, and the power of the study is very close to 1.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
