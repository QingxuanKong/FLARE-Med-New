    "question": "A 65-year-old woman has a 6-month history of progressive irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, frequent bowel movements, and a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss. She has had a neck mass for more than 10 years. 131I scan shows an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Defect in thyroxine (T4) biosynthesis",
        "B": "Graves' disease",
        "C": "Multinodular goiter",
        "D": "Riedel's thyroiditis"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the key features presented in the case: 1. The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a 6-month history of progressive irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, and frequent bowel movements, which are classic symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The significant weight loss of 6.8 kg (15 lb) over 6 months further supports this diagnosis. 2. The patient has had a neck mass for more than 10 years, which suggests a long-standing thyroid issue. 3. The 131I scan shows an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake. This pattern is suggestive of a multinodular goiter, which is characterized by multiple nodules of normal and abnormal thyroid tissue. Considering these features, let's evaluate the options: - Option A, a defect in thyroxine (T4) biosynthesis, would typically present with hypothyroidism symptoms, which are not consistent with the patient's presentation. - Option B, Graves' disease, is an autoimmune cause of hyperthyroidism that can present with a goiter, but the multinodular pattern on the 131I scan is not typical for Graves' disease. - Option D, Riedel's thyroiditis, is a form of chronic thyroiditis that can cause a hard, fibrotic goiter, but it is not typically associated with the symptoms and 131I scan pattern described in this case. - Option C, multinodular goiter, is the most likely diagnosis, as it explains the patient's long-standing neck mass, the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, and the 131I scan pattern of multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is multinodular goiter.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
