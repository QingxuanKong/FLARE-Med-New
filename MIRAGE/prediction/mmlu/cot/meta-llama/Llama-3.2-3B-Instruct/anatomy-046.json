The fibula is located on the outside of the lower leg, and it runs parallel to the tibia. Given this anatomical information, the fibula is a key structure that is commonly imaged in radiographic studies, particularly in the context of diagnosing and monitoring fractures, stress fractures, and other bone pathologies. Therefore, when a physician requests an X-ray study of the fibula, it is logical to infer that the procedure will be performed on the lower leg, which is the region where the fibula is located.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
