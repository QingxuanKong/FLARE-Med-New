    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step:\\n\\nOption A: Some exons in protein-coding genes consist of noncoding DNA. This statement is true. Noncoding exons are a subset of exons that do not code for amino acids and can have various functions such as regulatory elements, splicing sites, or microRNA binding sites.\\n\\nOption B: The first exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the translational start site. This statement is false. The translational start site is typically located at the beginning of the coding sequence, but it can be within an exon or even within an intron. The first exon may or may not contain the translational start site.\\n\\nOption C: The last exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the normal termination codon. This statement is false. The termination codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) can be located anywhere within the coding sequence, not just at the end of the last exon.\\n\\nOption D: A coding exon is always translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames. This statement is false. When a coding exon is translated, it can be read in one of the three possible forward reading frames, but the reading frame can change when the gene is spliced and the introns are removed. This can result in different translation products from the same exon.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is Option A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
