    "question": "Which of the following is true regarding reflexes?",
    "options": {
        "A": "A positive babinski reflex is the same as a normal flexor response in the assessment of the plantar reflex",
        "B": "An extensor plantar response indicates a lower motor neurone lesion",
        "C": "The root value of the ankle reflex is S1",
        "D": "The root value of the knee reflex is L1, L2"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. A positive Babinski reflex is typically an abnormal sign, not a normal flexor response. A normal plantar response is actually a flexor response, where the great toe points downward. A positive Babinski reflex is characterized by an extensor response, where the great toe points upward. This option A is incorrect. 2. The extensor plantar response, also known as the Babinski sign, is typically associated with upper motor neuron lesions, not lower motor neuron lesions. This is because it involves the corticospinal tract, which is responsible for the upper motor neurons. Option B is incorrect. 3. The root value of the ankle reflex is actually S1, not L1 or L2. The S1 nerve root is responsible for the plantar reflex, which is the normal response to stroking the sole of the foot. Option C is correct. 4. The root value of the knee reflex is actually L2-L4, not L1. The L1 nerve root is not primarily involved in the knee reflex. Option D is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is C, as it accurately describes the root value of the ankle reflex.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
