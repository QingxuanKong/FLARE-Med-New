    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what 'anticipation' means in the context of genetic disorders. Anticipation is a phenomenon where the symptoms of a genetic disorder become apparent at an earlier age as the disorder is passed from one generation to the next. This typically occurs due to the expansion of a specific type of repeat expansion in the DNA, such as CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene. With anticipation, the number of repeats increases with each generation, leading to earlier onset and more severe symptoms in subsequent generations.\\n\\nLet's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Huntington disease - This is a classic example of anticipation, as the CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene increases with each generation, leading to earlier onset and more severe symptoms.\\n\\nB. Marfan syndrome - This is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, not a repeat expansion, so it does not exhibit anticipation.\\n\\nC. Cystic fibrosis - This is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, not a repeat expansion, so it does not exhibit anticipation.\\n\\nD. Fragile X syndrome - While this is a genetic disorder caused by an expansion of the CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene, it is not an example of anticipation in the same way as Huntington disease, as the expansion is not directly related to the disorder's severity or onset age.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Huntington disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
