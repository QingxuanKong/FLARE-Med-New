    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's first understand what Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) are. SARMs are a class of compounds that are designed to act on androgen receptors in the body, but they do not contain steroids. This is the key difference between SARMs and traditional anabolic-androgenic steroids. The primary goal of SARMs is to mimic the beneficial effects of testosterone and other androgen hormones, such as muscle growth and bone density, without the negative side effects associated with traditional steroids. This is achieved by selectively targeting androgen receptors, which are responsible for the effects of androgen hormones. Now, let's analyze the options given: Option A: steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones. - This option is incorrect because SARMs are non-steroid drugs, not steroid drugs. Option B: steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors antagonising the effects of natural steroid hormones. - This option is incorrect because SARMs aim to mimic the effects of natural steroid hormones, not antagonize them. Option C: non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones. - This option is correct because SARMs are indeed non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors to mimic the effects of natural steroid hormones. Option D: non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors inhibiting the effects of natural steroid hormones. - This option is incorrect because SARMs aim to mimic the effects of natural steroid hormones, not inhibit them. Therefore, the correct answer is Option C: non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
