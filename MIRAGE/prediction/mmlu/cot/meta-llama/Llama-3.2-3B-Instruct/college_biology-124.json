    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down each option step by step: 1. **Understanding the term \"fixed action pattern\"**: A fixed action pattern (FAP) is a specific, automatic response to a specific stimulus that is innate, meaning it is genetically predetermined and not learned through experience. This response is often seen in animals, particularly in the early stages of development. 2. **Analyzing option A**: \"occurs the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus at the appropriate time in its life\" - This statement suggests that a fixed action pattern is only triggered under specific circumstances, which is not entirely accurate. FAPs are typically triggered by a single stimulus, not requiring multiple exposures. 3. **Analyzing option B**: \"occurs in the absence of sensory feedback\" - This statement is partially true, as FAPs are often innate and do not require sensory feedback to be triggered. However, this option does not fully capture the essence of what defines a fixed action pattern. 4. **Analyzing option C**: \"is a motor response which once released may be terminated spontaneously\" - This statement accurately describes a characteristic of FAPs. Once a fixed action pattern is initiated, it can be terminated on its own or by external factors, such as sensory feedback or environmental changes. 5. **Analyzing option D**: \"is triggered by a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment\" - While FAPs can be influenced by environmental stimuli, they are primarily triggered by a single, specific stimulus, not a \"number of sensory signals.\" Considering the above analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A fixed action pattern is a motor response which once released may be terminated spontaneously, which aligns with option C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
