    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break down the key concepts related to enzyme activity, pH, and the role of ionizing groups in enzyme-substrate interactions. 1. **Enzyme Activity and pH:** Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. Their activity can be influenced by various factors, including pH. However, if an enzyme's activity remains constant over a broad range of pH values, it suggests that the enzyme's structure and function are relatively stable across different pH levels. 2. **Ionizing Groups and pH:** Ionizing groups, also known as functional groups, are chemical groups within a molecule that can donate or accept protons (H+ ions). The ability of an ionizing group to participate in a reaction is pH-dependent. At different pH levels, ionizing groups can be protonated or deprotonated, which affects their reactivity. 3. **Enzyme-Substrate Interactions:** The interaction between an enzyme and its substrate is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity. Ionizing groups on both the enzyme and substrate can participate in the reaction. These groups can form chemical bonds, stabilize transition states, or facilitate the transfer of protons, thereby influencing the reaction rate. Considering these points, if an enzyme's activity is constant over a broad range of pH values, it is likely that: - **Ionizing groups on both the enzyme and substrate participate in the reaction**. This is because the enzyme's structure and function remain relatively stable across different pH levels, allowing the enzyme to maintain its ability to bind and interact with the substrate effectively. If only ionizing groups on the enzyme or substrate participated in the reaction, the enzyme's activity would likely change with pH, as these groups would be protonated or deprotonated, altering the enzyme-substrate interaction. Therefore, the answer is: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"If the activity of an enzyme is constant over a broad range of pH values, it is likely that ionizing groups on both the enzyme and substrate participate in the reaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"} ```",
