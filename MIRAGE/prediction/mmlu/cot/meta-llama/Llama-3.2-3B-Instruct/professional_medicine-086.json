    "question": "A healthy 4-year-old girl is brought for a well-child examination. A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper left sternal border. S2 is widely split and does not vary with respiration. A soft mid-diastolic murmur is heard along the lower left sternal border. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Aortic stenosis",
        "B": "Atrial septal defect",
        "C": "Coarctation of the aorta",
        "D": "Mitral valve prolapse"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the clinical findings and narrow down the possible causes of the murmur and other heart sounds. A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper left sternal border, which is a relatively mild murmur. This could be consistent with several conditions, but the key findings are the widely split S2 and the soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border. A widely split S2 is often seen in conditions that increase the volume of blood flowing through the pulmonary valve or cause an increase in the volume of blood in the right ventricle. This can be due to a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or an atrial septal defect (ASD). The soft mid-diastolic murmur is often associated with increased flow across the mitral valve, which could be due to an ASD. Aortic stenosis typically produces a harsh systolic ejection murmur, not a mid-diastolic murmur. Coarctation of the aorta would likely present with a more severe systolic murmur and possibly a systolic ejection murmur that worsens with maneuvers that increase aortic runoff (e.g., Valsalva maneuver). Mitral valve prolapse can cause a mid-systolic click and a late systolic murmur, but the S2 splitting and the soft mid-diastolic murmur are not typical findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
