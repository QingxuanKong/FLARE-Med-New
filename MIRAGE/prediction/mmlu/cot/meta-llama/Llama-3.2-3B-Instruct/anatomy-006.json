    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the anatomical regions of the abdomen. The abdomen is typically divided into several regions based on the location of the ribs and the relationship to the sternum. Starting from the front, the regions are: epigastric (just above the abdomen), hypochondriac (just above the abdomen, near the ribcage), and then the rest of the abdominal regions. The hypogastric region is actually located near the pelvis, not the abdomen. The lumbar region is also located in the lower back, not near the sternum. Therefore, the region that lies just distal to the sternum is the epigastric region.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
