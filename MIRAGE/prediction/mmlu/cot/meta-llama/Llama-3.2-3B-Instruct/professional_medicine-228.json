    "question": "A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of right shoulder pain that began after he chopped wood 2 days ago. Examination of the right upper extremity shows no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. The pain is reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance; there is no weakness. In addition to the teres minor, inflammation of which of the following tendons is most likely in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Infraspinatus",
        "B": "Pectoralis",
        "C": "Subscapularis",
        "D": "Supraspinatus"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. **Patient's symptoms**: The patient is experiencing right shoulder pain after chopping wood, which suggests a traumatic injury, likely a strain or overuse injury. 2. **Examination findings**: There are no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness, which suggests that the pain is not due to a fracture or joint dislocation. The pain is reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance, which indicates a problem with the muscles involved in external rotation. 3. **No weakness**: The patient does not have weakness, which suggests that the problem is not with the rotator cuff muscles that control shoulder movement. Considering these points, the likely injured structure is a muscle or tendon involved in external rotation of the shoulder. Now, let's evaluate the options: * **Infraspinatus (A)**: This muscle is involved in external rotation of the shoulder, and its tendon can be injured with overhead activities like chopping wood. The pain is reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder, which is consistent with an infraspinatus tendon injury. * **Pectoralis (B)**: This muscle is involved in flexion, adduction, and medial rotation of the shoulder, which is not directly related to external rotation. * **Subscapularis (C)**: This muscle is involved in internal rotation and stabilization of the shoulder joint, not external rotation. * **Supraspinatus (D)**: This muscle is involved in abduction of the shoulder, not external rotation. Based on the analysis, the most likely injured tendon is the infraspinatus tendon. Here's the output in JSON format: ``` {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a traumatic injury to the infraspinatus tendon, which is involved in external rotation of the shoulder. The pain is reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance, which is consistent with an infraspinatus tendon injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"} ```",
