        "A": "10-12 breaths per minute.",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step: 1. **Understanding Normal Respiratory Rate**: The normal respiratory rate, also known as the respiratory frequency, is the number of breaths taken per minute. This rate can vary slightly from person to person, but it generally falls within a specific range. 2. **Adult Respiratory Rate Range**: According to various medical guidelines, the normal respiratory rate for an adult is typically considered to be between 12 to 20 breaths per minute. This range can be further divided into two sub-ranges: 12-16 breaths per minute for adults with normal lung function, and 16-20 breaths per minute for adults with mild respiratory disease. 3. **Eliminating Incorrect Options**: Based on the above information, we can eliminate options A (10-12 breaths per minute) and B (8-10 breaths per minute) as they are outside the normal range. Option C (20-22 breaths per minute) is also outside the normal range. 4. **Selecting the Best Answer**: The only remaining option, D (14-16 breaths per minute), falls within the normal range for an adult male with normal lung function. Therefore, the correct answer is: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The normal respiratory rate for an adult male is between 12-20 breaths per minute, and option D (14-16 breaths per minute) falls within this range.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" } ```",
