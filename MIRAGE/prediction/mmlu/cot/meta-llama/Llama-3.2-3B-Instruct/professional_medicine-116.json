    "question": "A 60-year-old man had a total thyroidectomy and excision of enlarged left jugular lymph nodes for follicular carcinoma. The operation was uncomplicated. He is receiving intravenous 5% dextrose and 0.45% saline with potassium. Twelve hours after the operation he develops circumoral numbness and paresthesias in his fingertips, and he becomes very anxious. Vital signs are temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.7\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses a dry neck dressing and no stridor. Extremities are warm, with brisk capillary refill time. Additional physical examination is most likely to show which of the following?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Babinski sign present bilaterally",
        "B": "Chvostek sign",
        "C": "Deviation of the tongue to the left side",
        "D": "A drooping left shoulder"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing symptoms of numbness and paresthesias in his fingertips, which are indicative of hypocalcemia, likely due to the removal of the parathyroid glands during the thyroidectomy. The symptoms of anxiety and warm extremities with brisk capillary refill time further support this diagnosis. The dry neck dressing and lack of stridor suggest that the airway is not compromised. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Babinski sign is a neurological sign that indicates upper motor neuron lesion, which is not directly related to hypocalcemia. B. Chvostek sign is a clinical sign that indicates hypocalcemia, characterized by a twitching of the facial muscles when the facial nerve is tapped. This is a classic sign of hypocalcemia, especially in the context of thyroid surgery. C. Deviation of the tongue to the left side would indicate a third cranial nerve palsy, which is not directly related to hypocalcemia. D. A drooping left shoulder is indicative of a third cranial nerve palsy, which is not directly related to hypocalcemia. Based on the symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is hypocalcemia, and the most appropriate physical examination finding would be the Chvostek sign.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
