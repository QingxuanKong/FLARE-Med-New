    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the anatomy of the lymphatic drainage of the tongue. The tongue is divided into three parts: the anterior two-thirds, the posterior one-third, and the circumvallate papillae. The lymphatic drainage of the tongue is primarily to the submandibular lymph nodes. The anterior two-thirds of the tongue, which includes the tip of the tongue, drains to the submental lymph nodes. The submental lymph nodes are located under the chin and receive lymph from the anterior part of the tongue. Considering the specific location of the tip of the tongue, it is reasonable to conclude that the lymphatic drainage of the tip of the tongue is primarily to the submental lymph nodes. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The tip of the tongue drains to the submental lymph nodes due to its location in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, which is primarily drained by the submental lymph nodes. This is a common anatomical fact in human anatomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
