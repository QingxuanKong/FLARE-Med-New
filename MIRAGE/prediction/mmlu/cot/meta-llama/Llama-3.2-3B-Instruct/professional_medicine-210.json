    "question": "A 47-year-old man comes to the physician 12 hours after the sudden onset of a severe occipital headache and stiff neck. He has not had any other symptoms and has no history of severe headache. He has hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and ranitidine. He is oriented to person, place, and time. His temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.1\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. Range of motion of the neck is decreased due to pain. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Cluster headache",
        "B": "Meningitis",
        "C": "Migraine",
        "D": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's presentation and history: 1. **Sudden onset of severe occipital headache**: This suggests a vascular cause, as migraines and cluster headaches typically have a more gradual onset. Meningitis usually presents with fever, neck stiffness, and other systemic symptoms. 2. **Stiff neck**: This is a classic sign of meningitis, but it can also be present in subarachnoid hemorrhage due to irritation of the meninges. However, the absence of fever and other systemic symptoms makes meningitis less likely. 3. **Hypertension**: This is a risk factor for subarachnoid hemorrhage, particularly in the context of a sudden headache. 4. **No other symptoms**: The lack of other neurological deficits or systemic symptoms makes conditions like cluster headache or migraine less likely. 5. **Normal temperature**: This makes meningitis less likely, as fever is a common finding in this condition. Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is subarachnoid hemorrhage, given the sudden onset of severe headache, stiff neck, and hypertension in the absence of fever or other neurological deficits.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
