The diploid number refers to the total number of chromosomes in a cell of an organism. In humans, each cell typically contains two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from each parent. Since humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, the total number of chromosomes in a human cell is 23 x 2 = 46.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
