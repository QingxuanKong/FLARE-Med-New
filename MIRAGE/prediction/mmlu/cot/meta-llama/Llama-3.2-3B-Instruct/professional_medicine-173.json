    "question": "A 27-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 12 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit. She feels well. Pregnancy and delivery of her first child were uncomplicated. Medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), and blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 12-week gestation. Urine dipstick shows leukocyte esterase; urinalysis shows WBCs and rare gram-negative rods. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Recommend drinking 8 oz of cranberry juice daily",
        "B": "Oral amoxicillin therapy",
        "C": "Oral metronidazole therapy",
        "D": "Intravenous cefazolin therapy"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and test results. The patient is a 27-year-old woman at 12 weeks' gestation, presenting with a normal pregnancy and uncomplicated previous pregnancy and delivery. The pelvic examination is consistent with a 12-week gestation, and the urine dipstick shows leukocyte esterase, WBCs, and rare gram-negative rods. The presence of leukocyte esterase and WBCs in the urine is indicative of a urinary tract infection (UTI). The presence of gram-negative rods is concerning for a bacterial UTI, which is a common cause of UTIs in pregnant women. Given the patient's symptoms and test results, the next step in management should be to initiate antibiotic therapy to treat the UTI. The choice of antibiotic should be guided by the patient's pregnancy status and the type of bacteria suspected to be causing the UTI. In pregnant women, the preferred antibiotics for UTIs are those that are safe for use during pregnancy and effective against the suspected bacteria. Oral amoxicillin is often used as a first-line treatment for UTIs in pregnant women, but its effectiveness against gram-negative bacteria may be limited. Oral metronidazole and intravenous cefazolin are not typically used to treat UTIs in pregnancy. Cranberry juice may be considered as a supportive measure to help prevent UTIs, but it is not an appropriate replacement for antibiotic therapy in this case. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is oral amoxicillin therapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
