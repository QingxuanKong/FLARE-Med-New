    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. **Body Temperature (A)**: Mammals are known for their homeostatic regulation of body temperature, which is maintained within a narrow range of 36.5-37.5\u00b0C (97.7-99.5\u00b0F). This is crucial for proper bodily functions, such as enzyme activity and nerve function. Therefore, mammals are homeostatic for body temperature. 2. **Blood Glucose Concentration (B)**: Mammals have a homeostatic regulation of blood glucose levels, primarily through the action of insulin and glucagon. These hormones help maintain blood glucose concentrations within a narrow range, ensuring that glucose is available to cells when needed and preventing excessive levels that can lead to diabetes. Thus, mammals are homeostatic for blood glucose concentration. 3. **Blood pH (C)**: Mammals have a homeostatic regulation of blood pH, which is maintained within a narrow range of 7.35-7.45. This is crucial for proper enzyme function and prevention of cellular damage. The body maintains acid-base balance through various mechanisms, including the kidneys' ability to regulate acid excretion and the lungs' ability to regulate CO2 levels. Therefore, mammals are homeostatic for blood pH. 4. **Metabolic Rate (D)**: While mammals have some homeostatic regulation of metabolic rate, particularly in response to changes in food availability or energy needs, this is not as tightly regulated as the other three options. Mammals can adjust their metabolic rate based on factors such as temperature, activity level, and nutritional status, but this is not a constant, tightly regulated homeostasis. This makes it the correct answer to the question. Therefore, the answer is: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mammals have homeostatic regulation of body temperature, blood glucose concentration, and blood pH, but metabolic rate is not tightly regulated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" } ```",
