    "question": "A technician wants to determine whether cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA is present in the blood of a bone marrow transplant recipient. DNA purified from the leukocytes of the patient is reacted in a mixture containing oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides. Repetitive cycles of heating and cooling are performed, and the reaction product is detected by gel electrophoresis. The technician most likely used which of the following laboratory procedures on this patient's blood?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Northern blotting",
        "B": "Polymerase chain reaction",
        "C": "Reverse transcription",
        "D": "Southern blotting"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's break down the steps involved in the procedure described: 1. **DNA purification from leukocytes**: This step involves isolating DNA from white blood cells (leukocytes) in the patient's blood. This is a common step in various molecular biology techniques. 2. **Reaction mixture containing oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides**: This mixture suggests that the technician is setting up a PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) reaction. PCR is a technique used to amplify specific DNA sequences. 3. **Repetitive cycles of heating and cooling**: This is another key characteristic of PCR. The cycles involve denaturation (heating) of the DNA, annealing (cooling) of the primers to the target sequence, and extension (heating) of the DNA by the polymerase. 4. **Detection by gel electrophoresis**: The amplified DNA product is then separated and detected using gel electrophoresis, a technique used to separate DNA fragments based on size. Given these steps, the technician is most likely performing **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)**. Here's the answer in the requested JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The technician purified DNA from leukocytes, set up a PCR reaction with oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, and repeated cycles of heating and cooling to amplify the target sequence. The amplified product was then detected by gel electrophoresis. This matches the description of PCR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
