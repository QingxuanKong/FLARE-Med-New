    "question": "A 5-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents for evaluation of recurrent injuries. Her parents say that she started walking at the age of 14 months and since then has always seemed clumsier and had more injuries than other children. She has had increasingly frequent chest pain with exertion since starting a soccer program 3 months ago. She usually has pain or swelling of her knees or ankles after practice. She has been wearing glasses for 2 years. Her 16-year-old brother has required two operations for a severe rotator cuff injury he sustained while taking a shower, and she has a maternal cousin who died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 26 years. Today, the patient walks with a limp. She is at the 99th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. A midsystolic click is heard at the apex. The left ankle is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. The joints of the upper and lower extremities are hypermobile, including 25 degrees of genu recurvatum, thumbs that may be extended to touch the forearms, and flexibility at the waist, with palms easily touching the floor with straight knees. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Skeletal survey",
        "B": "Echocardiography",
        "C": "Bone scan",
        "D": "MRI of the shoulder"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this case, let's break down the key findings and consider possible diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and family history. The patient presents with a history of frequent injuries, particularly to joints, and a family history of aortic aneurysm and rotator cuff injury. The patient also has a midsystolic click at the apex, which could indicate mitral valve prolapse, and hypermobile joints, including genu recurvatum, thumb hyperextension, and joint laxity. The presence of aortic aneurysm in a first-degree relative increases the suspicion for Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue. Marfan syndrome can cause aortic aneurysms, mitral valve prolapse, joint hypermobility, and skeletal abnormalities. Given the patient's age, symptoms, and family history, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to evaluate the cardiovascular system, as Marfan syndrome often affects the aorta and mitral valve. The midsystolic click at the apex could indicate mitral valve prolapse, which is a common feature of Marfan syndrome. The patient's hypermobile joints and joint laxity also support this possibility. While a skeletal survey (A) could be useful in identifying skeletal abnormalities, it would not address the cardiovascular concerns. A bone scan (C) is not typically used in the initial evaluation of Marfan syndrome. An MRI of the shoulder (D) would be more relevant if the primary concern was a shoulder injury or condition. Therefore, echocardiography (B) is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis to evaluate the patient's cardiovascular system and assess for signs of mitral valve prolapse or other cardiac abnormalities associated with Marfan syndrome.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
