    "question": "A 33-year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of chronic pelvic pain that began after she underwent a hysterectomy 6\u00a0months ago. Following a physical examination, a CT\u00a0scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down the key elements and concepts involved in the scenario. The patient is suing for negligence, alleging that the surgical sponge was left in her pelvis due to the negligence of the medical staff. The key issue here is the inference of negligence from the presence of the sponge. A. Collateral estoppel is a doctrine that precludes a party from relitigating an issue that has already been resolved in a previous lawsuit. This is not relevant to the scenario, as the issue is not about whether the patient can relitigate a previous lawsuit, but rather about the inference of negligence from the presence of the sponge. B. Proximate cause refers to the legal concept that establishes a causal link between the defendant's actions (or inactions) and the plaintiff's injuries. While proximate cause is relevant to the negligence claim, it is not the most appropriate term to describe the inference of negligence from the presence of the sponge. C. Res ipsa loquitur is a doctrine that infers negligence from the very nature of the accident or injury, as in 'the thing speaks for itself.' In this scenario, the presence of a surgical sponge in the patient's pelvis after a hysterectomy is a strong indication of negligence, as it is highly unlikely that the sponge would remain in the patient's body without someone's fault. This doctrine is often used in medical malpractice cases where the defendant's negligence can be inferred from the very nature of the injury. D. Respondeat superior is a doctrine that holds an employer liable for the actions of its employees, even if the employer did not directly engage in the wrongful conduct. This doctrine is not relevant to the scenario, as the issue is not about the employer's liability, but rather about the inference of negligence from the presence of the sponge. Given the analysis, the most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is C. res ipsa loquitur.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
