    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate: This statement is true. In muscle cells, glycogen is broken down into glucose-1-phosphate by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, which is activated by the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) and the hormone glucagon. 2. Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles: This statement is true. Type I muscle fibres are slow-twitch fibres that are well-suited for endurance activities, such as distance running. They have a high capacity for oxidative phosphorylation and are more efficient at using oxygen to generate energy. 3. Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration: This statement is true. The liver stores glycogen, which can be broken down to glucose and released into the bloodstream as needed to maintain blood glucose concentrations within a narrow range. 4. Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body: This statement is not true. Insulin primarily promotes glucose uptake by muscle and fat cells, but not by the brain, which relies on glucose as a primary source of energy. Insulin has little effect on glucose uptake in the brain, which is able to use other sources of energy, such as ketones and fatty acids, during fasting or low-carbohydrate diets. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\"}",
