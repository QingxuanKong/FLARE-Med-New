    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the evolutionary history of respiratory systems in different animal groups. The development of lung tissue that can support gas exchange without supplementary organs is a significant milestone in the evolution of respiration. The first animals to develop this ability would likely be those that required a more efficient respiratory system to cope with the demands of their environment. Amphibians, such as frogs and toads, have a well-developed respiratory system that includes lungs, but they still use their skin as a secondary respiratory organ for gas exchange. Reptiles, including snakes, lizards, and turtles, also have lungs, but their respiratory system is more primitive compared to mammals. Mammals, including humans, have a highly developed respiratory system with lungs that can support gas exchange without the need for supplementary organs. Trematoda, a class of flatworms, do not have lungs or a well-developed respiratory system. Considering the above information, the first groups of animals to develop lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without the use of supplementary gas exchange organs were the mammals.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
