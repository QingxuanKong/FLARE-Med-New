Fatty acids need to be converted into a form that can be used by the mitochondria for energy production. The process of transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria involves a coenzyme that plays a crucial role in this process.\\n\\nThe key coenzyme involved in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria is carnitine. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) is the enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a fatty acyl group from CoA to carnitine, forming acyl-carnitine, which can then be transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Once inside the mitochondria, the acyl-carnitine is converted back to acyl-CoA by carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II).\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is the one that directly facilitates the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
