    "question": "What is the most likely outcome of this modification?\n\ufeff\nAn RNA strand that normally produces a transmembrane protein that facilitates potassium entry into muscle cells is modified to produce a different strand. The original strand is as follows:\n\n GAAUAGAUGGGAAGCGCCAGAUACAGUAACAGA\u2026 \n\nThe modified sequence is as follows:\n\n GAAUAGAUGGGAAGCGCCAGAUACAGUACCAGA\u2026",
    "options": {
        "A": "Absence of the protein",
        "B": "Production of a similar-sized but dysfunctional protein",
        "C": "No change",
        "D": "Production of a larger, likely dysfunctional protein"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given RNA sequences. The original RNA strand is 32 nucleotides long, and the modified strand is 33 nucleotides long. The only difference between the two sequences is the last nucleotide, which is changed from 'A' to 'C' in the modified strand. In RNA, the last nucleotide is the stop codon, which signals the termination of protein synthesis. The standard stop codons in RNA are UAA, UAG, and UGA. Since the modified strand has a 'C' instead of 'A', it is unlikely to be a stop codon. Therefore, the addition of the extra nucleotide 'C' will not terminate the protein synthesis. The change from 'A' to 'C' could potentially affect the function of the protein. Since the rest of the sequence remains the same, the modified protein will likely be similar in size and structure to the original protein. However, the change in the last nucleotide could alter the protein's function or stability. Given these considerations, the most likely outcome is that the modified protein will be produced, but its function may be affected. This makes option B, 'Production of a similar-sized but dysfunctional protein', the most plausible answer.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
