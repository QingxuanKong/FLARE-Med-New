    "question": "Which of the following conditions is not caused by a mutation in FGFR3?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Achondroplasia",
        "B": "Crouzon syndrome",
        "C": "Thanatophoric dysplasia",
        "D": "Waardenburg syndrome"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's evaluate each option one by one, considering the association with FGFR3 mutations: 1. Achondroplasia: This is a genetic disorder that affects bone growth, and it is known to be caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. Therefore, it is likely related to FGFR3. 2. Crouzon syndrome: This is another genetic disorder affecting bone development, and it is primarily associated with mutations in the FGFR2 gene, not FGFR3. However, it's worth noting that FGFR2 and FGFR3 are closely related, and some sources may overlap in their classifications. Nevertheless, the primary association is with FGFR2. 3. Thanatophoric dysplasia: This condition is also related to bone development and is known to be caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. Therefore, it is likely related to FGFR3. 4. Waardenburg syndrome: This is a genetic disorder affecting pigmentation and hearing, and it is primarily associated with mutations in the PAX7 gene, not FGFR3. Given the information, the condition that is not caused by a mutation in FGFR3 is Waardenburg syndrome. Here's the output in json format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Evaluating each option, we find that Achondroplasia, Thanatophoric dysplasia, and Crouzon syndrome are associated with FGFR3 mutations, while Waardenburg syndrome is primarily associated with mutations in the PAX7 gene. Therefore, the correct answer is Waardenburg syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
