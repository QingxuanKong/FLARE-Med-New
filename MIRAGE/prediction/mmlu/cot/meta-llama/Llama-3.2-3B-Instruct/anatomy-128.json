    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break it down step by step. Step 1: Identify the primary function of saliva in the human body. Saliva plays a crucial role in the digestion process, and one of its key functions is to break down food into smaller molecules that can be easily absorbed by the body. Step 2: Determine which nutrients are commonly found in food that need to be broken down. Starches, proteins, fats, and minerals are all common nutrients found in food. However, we need to identify which one is specifically broken down by the enzyme in saliva. Step 3: Recall the enzyme responsible for breaking down a specific nutrient in saliva. The enzyme amylase is found in saliva and is responsible for breaking down starches into simpler sugars. This process is known as hydrolysis. Step 4: Match the enzyme with the correct nutrient. Based on the above information, we can conclude that the enzyme in saliva acts upon starches, breaking them down into simpler sugars. Step 5: Select the correct answer choice. Based on the step-by-step analysis, the correct answer is A. Starches.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"A\"",
