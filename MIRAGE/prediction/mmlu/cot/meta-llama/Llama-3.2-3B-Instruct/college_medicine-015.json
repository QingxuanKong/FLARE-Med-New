    "question": "A scientist carrying out experiments on hearing aids fits 30 mice that were genetically modified to lose their hearing with the latest technology and were tested to press a lever when they heard a bell. This was set to varying levels of power. At 80% power, 20 mice pressed the lever. At 70% power, 15 mice pressed the lever. At 60% power, 10 mice pressed the lever. Which of the following power levels corresponds to the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell?",

    "predict": "To find the absolute threshold for hearing, we need to determine the power level at which 50% of the mice press the lever. Step 1: Determine the slope of the curve. We can use the three given points (20, 80), (15, 70), and (10, 60) to calculate the slope. The formula for slope is m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). m = (70 - 60)/(15 - 10) = 10/5 = 2 Step 2: Use the slope to find the equation of the line. The equation of a line can be written as y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Using point (20, 80), we can substitute the values to find b: 80 = 2(20) + b 80 = 40 + b b = 40 So, the equation of the line is y = 2x + 40 Step 3: Find the x-value for y = 50 (50% of 30 mice). 50 = 2x + 40 2x = 10 x = 5 Step 4: Find the corresponding power level. Since x represents the percentage power, we can substitute x = 5 into the equation to find the corresponding power level. y = 2(5) + 40 y = 10 + 40 y = 50 However, this is the percentage of mice pressing the lever, not the power level. To find the power level, we need to know that 80% corresponds to 20 mice, so we can set up a proportion. Let x be the power level corresponding to 50 mice. 20/80 = 50/x x = (50 * 80)/20 x = 200 So, the power level corresponding to 50% of the mice pressing the lever is 200%. However, this is not among the answer choices. We need to consider that the question is asking for the power level that corresponds to the absolute threshold for hearing, which is the minimum power required to hear the bell. Since the power level of 200% is not possible, we need to consider the point at which 50% of the mice were able to hear the bell. We can use the point (20, 80) to find the power level corresponding to 50% of the mice. We can set up a proportion: Let x be the power level corresponding to 50 mice. 20/x = 50/100 x = (20 * 100)/50 x = 40 So, the power level corresponding to 50% of the mice pressing the lever is 40%. Therefore, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the absolute threshold for hearing, we calculated the slope of the curve using three given points and found the equation of the line. We then found the x-value for y = 50 (50% of 30 mice) and the corresponding power level. However, this power level was not among the answer choices, so we need to consider the point at which 50% of the mice were able to hear the bell. We found that the power level corresponding to 50% of the mice is 40%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
