    "question": "A 16-year-old male is brought to the emergency department with sudden-onset swelling of the right knee. He denies any trauma. Past medical history reveals cystic fibrosis. Examination of the knee reveals fluctuance on palpation of the joint but no increased warmth; mild restriction in range of motion due to the swelling is also noted. Numerous bruises are noted in various stages of resolution. Further history reveals easy bruising and bleeding from the gums over the past month. The most likely explanation for these findings is",
    "options": {
        "A": "acquired factor VIII deficiency",
        "B": "diffuse intravascular coagulation secondary to infection",
        "C": "hypocomplementemia",
        "D": "malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and history in the context of his underlying condition, cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is a genetic disorder that affects the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems, and is often associated with various complications, including malabsorption of essential nutrients. The patient's easy bruising and bleeding from the gums suggest a bleeding disorder. Let's analyze the options: Option A, acquired factor VIII deficiency, is a bleeding disorder that can cause easy bruising and bleeding. However, it is not directly related to CF. Option B, diffuse intravascular coagulation secondary to infection, can cause bleeding and bruising, but there is no clear indication of infection in the patient's presentation. Option D, malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K, is a complication of CF, but it is not directly related to bleeding or bruising. Option C, hypocomplementemia, is a condition characterized by low levels of complement proteins, which are part of the immune system. CF patients with hypocomplementemia are at risk of developing bleeding and bruising due to impaired immune function and increased susceptibility to infections. This option is the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms. Given the patient's history of CF and easy bruising, the most likely explanation for his findings is hypocomplementemia.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
