    "predict": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. **Understanding DNA structure**: DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is a double-stranded helix composed of nucleotides. Each nucleotide is made up of a nitrogenous base, a sugar molecule (deoxyribose in DNA), and a phosphate group. 2. **Identifying nitrogenous bases**: The nitrogenous bases in DNA are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). These are known as purines (A and G) and pyrimidines (C and T). 3. **Analyzing the options**: - A. **Purine**: This is a type of nitrogenous base found in DNA, specifically adenine and guanine. Therefore, it is part of DNA. - B. **Pyrimidine**: This is also a type of nitrogenous base found in DNA, specifically cytosine and thymine. Therefore, it is part of DNA. - C. **Deoxyribose**: This is the sugar molecule that makes up the backbone of DNA. Therefore, it is part of DNA. - D. **Amino acid**: Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, not nucleotides. They are not part of DNA. 4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the molecule that does not form part of DNA is amino acid. ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Analyzing each option, we can conclude that amino acid is the only option that is not part of DNA.
