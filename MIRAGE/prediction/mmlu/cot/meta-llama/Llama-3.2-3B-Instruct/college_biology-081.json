    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down each option and think step-by-step: 1. **Understanding the question**: We're looking for a technique to demonstrate protein binding to specific DNA sequences. This implies a method that can visualize the interaction between proteins and DNA. 2. **Analyzing the options**: - **A. Western blot hybridization**: This technique is primarily used to detect specific proteins in a sample. It involves separating proteins by size, transferring them to a membrane, and then detecting the target protein using antibodies. It's not directly related to DNA sequences. - **B. Northern blot hybridization**: This method is used to detect specific RNA sequences. It involves separating RNA by size, transferring it to a membrane, and then detecting the target RNA using labeled probes. Again, it's not directly related to protein-DNA interactions. - **C. Southern blot hybridization**: Similar to Northern blotting, Southern blotting is used to detect specific DNA sequences. It involves separating DNA by size, transferring it to a membrane, and then detecting the target DNA using labeled probes. It's not related to protein-DNA interactions. - **D. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)**: EMSA is a technique used to study protein-DNA interactions. It involves separating proteins by size using gel electrophoresis and then observing how they interact with DNA. The technique can reveal which proteins bind to specific DNA sequences. 3. **Conclusion**: Based on the above analysis, EMSA is the technique that directly demonstrates protein binding to specific DNA sequences. Here is the output in json format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which technique demonstrates protein binding to specific DNA sequences, we need to consider what each method is used for. Western blot hybridization and Northern blot hybridization are primarily used for detecting proteins and RNA, respectively. Southern blot hybridization is used for detecting DNA sequences. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), on the other hand, is specifically designed to study protein-DNA interactions. Therefore, EMSA is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" } ```",
