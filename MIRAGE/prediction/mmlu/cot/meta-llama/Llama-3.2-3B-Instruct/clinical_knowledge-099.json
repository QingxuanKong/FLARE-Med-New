    "options": {
        "A": "0.192",
        "B": "1.92",
        "C": "1920",
        "D": "0.96"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To find the daily dose in grams, we need to divide the given dose (960 mg) by the frequency of administration (12 hours) and then convert the result to grams. Step 1: Divide the dose by the frequency of administration. 960 mg / 12 hours = 80 mg/hour Step 2: Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the hourly dose by 24 to get the daily dose. 80 mg/hour * 24 hours = 1920 mg Step 3: Convert the daily dose from milligrams (mg) to grams (g). Since 1 gram = 1000 milligrams, we divide the daily dose by 1000 to convert it to grams. 1920 mg / 1000 = 1.92 g Therefore, the daily dose of Cotrimoxazole is 1.92 grams. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the daily dose in grams, we first divide the given dose (960 mg) by the frequency of administration (12 hours) to get the hourly dose (80 mg/hour), then multiply the hourly dose by 24 hours to get the daily dose (1920 mg), and finally convert the daily dose from milligrams to grams (1.92 g).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
