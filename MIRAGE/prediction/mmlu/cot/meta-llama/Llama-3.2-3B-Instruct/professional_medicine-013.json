    "question": "A 32-year-old male presents to the office with the complaint of pain in his right shoulder for the past two weeks. Physical examination reveals tenderness at the greater tubercle of the humerus and painful abduction of the right upper extremity. The cause of this patient's condition is most likely a somatic dysfunction of which of the following muscles?",
    "options": {
        "A": "anterior scalene",
        "B": "latissimus dorsi",
        "C": "pectoralis minor",
        "D": "supraspinatus"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and physical examination findings presented by the patient. The patient complains of pain in the right shoulder and tenderness at the greater tubercle of the humerus, as well as painful abduction of the right upper extremity. These symptoms are classic for impingement syndrome, which is commonly associated with the rotator cuff, specifically the supraspinatus muscle. The supraspinatus muscle is one of the muscles that make up the rotator cuff and is responsible for stabilizing the shoulder joint and assisting in abduction of the arm. Impingement of the supraspinatus tendon against the greater tubercle of the humerus can lead to pain and tenderness in the area. The painful abduction of the arm further supports this diagnosis. The anterior scalene, latissimus dorsi, and pectoralis minor muscles are not directly related to the symptoms presented by the patient. Therefore, the most likely muscle involved in the patient's condition is the supraspinatus muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
