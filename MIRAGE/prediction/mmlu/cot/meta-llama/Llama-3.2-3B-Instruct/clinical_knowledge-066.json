    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the known effects of morphine, a commonly used opioid analgesic. Morphine is known for its analgesic properties, which means it reduces pain intensity. It works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, which decreases the transmission of pain signals. Now, let's analyze the options: Option A: Reduces pain intensity and increases alertness. This option is incorrect because morphine is known to cause drowsiness and sedation, not increased alertness. Option B: Reduces pain intensity but also causes sedation. This option is correct because morphine is a potent analgesic that can cause significant sedation as a side effect. Option C: Reduces pain intensity but also causes diarrhoea. This option is partially correct in that morphine can cause constipation, not diarrhoea, as a side effect. Option D: Reduces pain intensity but also causes insomnia. This option is incorrect because morphine can cause drowsiness and sedation, not insomnia. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Reduces pain intensity but also causes sedation.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
