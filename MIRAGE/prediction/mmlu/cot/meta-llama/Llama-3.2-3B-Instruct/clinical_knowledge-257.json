The gastric parietal cells are responsible for secreting gastric acid and intrinsic factor, which helps in the digestion of food in the stomach. They do not secrete insulin.\\n\\nB. The pancreas is known for its role in digestion and glucose regulation in the body. It contains several types of cells, including beta cells that are responsible for producing and secreting insulin.\\n\\nC. The walls of the large intestine are primarily involved in the absorption of water and electrolytes from the remaining waste material after digestion. They do not secrete insulin.\\n\\nD. The autonomic nervous system regulates involuntary functions of the body, such as heart rate and digestion, but it does not secrete insulin.\\n\\nConsidering the functions of each option, it is clear that the organ responsible for secreting insulin is the pancreas.\\n\\n\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
