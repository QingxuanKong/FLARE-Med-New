    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Understanding pKb and pOH**: pKb is the negative logarithm of the base dissociation constant (Kb) of a base. pOH is the negative logarithm of the hydroxide ion concentration in a solution. For a weak base, the dissociation reaction is: B + H2O \u21cc BH+ + OH- 2. **Relationship between pKb and pOH**: For a weak base, the pKb is related to pOH by the equation: pKb + pOH = 14 3. **pOH for a weak base**: Since pOH is the negative logarithm of the hydroxide ion concentration, for a weak base, the pOH will be lower than the pKb (since pOH is negative and pKb is positive). This is because the base only partially dissociates, resulting in a lower hydroxide ion concentration. 4. **Conclusion**: Given that pKb + pOH = 14, and pOH is lower than pKb for a weak base, the pKb will be higher than the pOH. Therefore, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"For a very weak base, the pKb is higher than the pOH because the base only partially dissociates, resulting in a lower hydroxide ion concentration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
