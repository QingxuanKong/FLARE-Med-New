    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down each option and analyze its relationship to Angelman syndrome: 1. **Understanding Angelman Syndrome**: Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and is characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and ataxia. It is often associated with a deficiency in the UBE3A gene on chromosome 15. 2. **Maternal Uniparental Disomy (UPD) 15 (A)**: Uniparental disomy occurs when a person receives two copies of a chromosome from one parent and no copies from the other parent. Maternal UPD 15 can lead to Angelman syndrome because the UBE3A gene is maternally imprinted, meaning it is expressed only from the mother. If a child receives two maternal copies of chromosome 15, the UBE3A gene is not expressed, leading to Angelman syndrome. 3. **Paternal Uniparental Disomy 15 (B)**: This would not lead to Angelman syndrome. Since the paternal copy of chromosome 15 is not imprinted, it would still express the UBE3A gene, preventing the syndrome. 4. **Deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15 (C)**: While deletions in the paternal copy of chromosome 15 can lead to Prader-Willi syndrome, not Angelman syndrome. The UBE3A gene is paternally imprinted, but deletions in the paternal copy would lead to loss of the paternal UBE3A gene expression, which is not the cause of Angelman syndrome. 5. **A mutation in the SNRPN promoter (D)**: Mutations in the SNRPN gene can lead to Prader-Willi syndrome, not Angelman syndrome. The SNRPN gene is located on chromosome 15, but it is not the gene responsible for Angelman syndrome. Considering these points, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Maternal Uniparental Disomy (UPD) 15 (A) is the correct answer because it leads to the loss of maternal UBE3A gene expression, which is necessary for the development of Angelman syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
