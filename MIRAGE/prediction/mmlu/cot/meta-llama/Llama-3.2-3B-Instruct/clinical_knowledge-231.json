    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the types of muscle fibers and their characteristics: 1. **Type I fibers**: These fibers are slow-twitch fibers that are more efficient for endurance activities and are primarily responsible for oxidative phosphorylation. They have a high capillarization and are more resistant to fatigue. 2. **Type Ia fibers**: These fibers are also slow-twitch fibers that are primarily involved in proprioception (sensing the position and movement of the body). They are not primarily responsible for generating force and are more involved in fine motor control. 3. **Type IIa fibers**: These fibers are fast-twitch fibers that are more efficient for power and speed. They are more resistant to fatigue than Type I fibers but are not as resistant as Type IIx fibers. 4. **Type IIx fibers**: These fibers are also fast-twitch fibers but are the most fatigue-resistant of all muscle fibers. They are primarily responsible for generating force and speed, making them ideal for high-intensity, short-duration activities like sprinting. Given the characteristics of each fiber type, when it comes to all-out exercise such as sprinting, the first fiber types to fatigue would be the **Type I fibers**. They are not designed for high-intensity, short-duration activities and are more suited for endurance activities. ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the characteristics of each muscle fiber type and their roles in different types of activities.
