    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the process step by step: 1. **Understanding \u03b1-thalassaemia**: \u03b1-thalassaemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of the alpha-globin subunit of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. This disorder is characterized by reduced or absent production of the alpha-globin chains, leading to anemia and other complications. 2. **Genetic basis**: The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition. 3. **Common mutation type**: The most common mutation in \u03b1-thalassaemia is a specific type of mutation that affects the gene that codes for the alpha-globin subunit. This mutation typically involves a deletion of a single nucleotide. 4. **Considering the options**: - A. Deletion: This is the correct type of mutation commonly found in \u03b1-thalassaemia. The deletion typically involves the removal of a single nucleotide from the HBA1 or HBA2 gene, leading to a frameshift mutation that disrupts the production of the alpha-globin subunit. - B. Duplication: While duplications can also cause genetic disorders, they are not the most common mutation type associated with \u03b1-thalassaemia. - C. Insertion: Insertions can also lead to genetic disorders, but they are not as commonly associated with \u03b1-thalassaemia as deletions. - D. Point mutation: Point mutations, which involve a change in a single nucleotide, can occur in \u03b1-thalassaemia but are not as characteristic of the disorder as deletions. **Answer**: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The common mutation in \u03b1-thalassaemia consists of a deletion, which typically involves the removal of a single nucleotide from the HBA1 or HBA2 gene, leading to a frameshift mutation that disrupts the production of the alpha-globin subunit.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
