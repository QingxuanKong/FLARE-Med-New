    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. **Understanding the question**: We are looking for the factor that varies with the stimulus intensity, specifically in relation to the brain's ability to detect differences in stimulus intensity. 2. **Analyzing option A: The amplitude of the action potential**: The amplitude of an action potential is the maximum change in membrane potential that occurs during an action potential. While the amplitude of an action potential is related to the intensity of the stimulus, it is not the primary factor that determines the brain's ability to detect differences in stimulus intensity. The amplitude of an action potential is more related to the strength of the stimulus itself, rather than the detection of differences in intensity. 3. **Analyzing option B: The threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum membrane potential required for an action potential to be initiated. This is the key concept in understanding how the brain detects differences in stimulus intensity. When a stimulus is weak, the membrane potential does not reach the threshold potential, and no action potential is generated. However, as the stimulus intensity increases, the membrane potential approaches the threshold potential, and eventually, an action potential is generated. This indicates that the threshold potential is directly related to the detection of differences in stimulus intensity. 4. **Analyzing option C: The number of action potentials per second**: The number of action potentials per second is related to the frequency of the stimulus, not the intensity. The brain can detect differences in frequency, but not necessarily differences in intensity. 5. **Analyzing option D: The number of synapses crossed**: The number of synapses crossed is related to the strength of synaptic transmission, not the detection of differences in stimulus intensity. While the number of synapses crossed can influence the overall processing of a stimulus, it is not directly related to the brain's ability to detect differences in intensity. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the ability of the brain to detect differences in stimulus intensity is best explained by the fact that the threshold potential varies with the stimulus intensity. **Output**: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ability of the brain to detect differences in stimulus intensity is best explained by the fact that the threshold potential varies with the stimulus intensity.
