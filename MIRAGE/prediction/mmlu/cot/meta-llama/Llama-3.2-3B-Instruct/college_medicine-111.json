    "question": "If a gas occupies 0.1L at 200atm, what will its volume be at 1atm?",
    "options": {
        "A": "slightly less than 20L",
        "B": "20L",
        "C": "slightly more than 20L",
        "D": "2000L"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To solve this problem, we can use Boyle's Law, which states that, at constant temperature, the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure. Mathematically, this can be expressed as: P1V1 = P2V2 Where: - P1 is the initial pressure (200 atm) - V1 is the initial volume (0.1 L) - P2 is the final pressure (1 atm) - V2 is the final volume (unknown) Rearranging the equation to solve for V2, we get: V2 = P1V1 / P2 Plugging in the given values, we get: V2 = (200 atm * 0.1 L) / 1 atm V2 = 20 L Therefore, the volume of the gas will be slightly less than 20L, since the pressure is reduced from 200 atm to 1 atm, which would cause the gas to expand. However, since the initial volume is so small (0.1L), the change in volume will be minimal. Here is the answer in json format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Using Boyle's Law (P1V1 = P2V2), we can calculate the final volume (V2) by rearranging the equation to V2 = P1V1 / P2. Plugging in the given values, we get V2 = (200 atm * 0.1 L) / 1 atm = 20 L. Since the pressure is reduced from 200 atm to 1 atm, the gas will expand, but the initial volume is very small, so the change in volume will be minimal. Therefore, the final volume will be slightly less than 20L.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
