    "question": "Myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fiber (MERRF) is an extremely rare disorder that affects neuromuscular systems. MERRF results from a mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that impairs protein synthesis, oxygen consumption, and energy production. When an affected male and a normal female reproduce, which of the following best predicts the expected phenotypic ratios of the offspring?",
    "options": {
        "A": "None of the offspring will be affected",
        "B": "All males and no females will be affected",
        "C": "Half of males and half of females will be affected",
        "D": "One-fourth of the offspring will be affected"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To solve this question, we need to understand the genetic basis of MERRF and the principles of Mendelian inheritance. MERRF is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition. Since MERRF is caused by a mutation in mitochondrial DNA, it is inherited maternally, meaning that the mutated gene is passed from the mother to her offspring. Here's the step-by-step thinking: 1. The mother is affected by MERRF, which means she is a carrier of the mutated gene. 2. The father is not affected by MERRF, so he does not carry the mutated gene. 3. When the mother and father reproduce, they can pass on their genes to their offspring. 4. The father contributes a normal Y chromosome to all male offspring, while the mother contributes a normal mtDNA to all offspring. 5. The mother contributes a mutated mtDNA to all offspring, as she is the carrier of the mutated gene. 6. Since the father does not contribute any mutated mtDNA, all offspring will receive a normal mtDNA from him. 7. Since all offspring receive a normal mtDNA from the father and a mutated mtDNA from the mother, they will all be affected by MERRF. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratio of the offspring is that all of them will be affected by MERRF. Here's the output in json format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mother is a carrier of the mutated gene and passes it to all offspring, while the father contributes a normal mtDNA to all offspring. As a result, all offspring will receive a mutated mtDNA and will be affected by MERRF.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
