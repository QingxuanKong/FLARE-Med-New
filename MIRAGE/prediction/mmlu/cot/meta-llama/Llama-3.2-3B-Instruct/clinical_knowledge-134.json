    "options": {
        "A": "The knee is a ball and socket joint",
        "B": "A baker's cyst can sometimes be found anterior to the knee",
        "C": "The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion",
        "D": "'knock knee' deformity is due to bilateral genu varum"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's evaluate each option step by step: 1. The knee joint is actually a hinge joint, not a ball and socket joint. So, option A is incorrect. 2. A baker's cyst is a type of fluid-filled swelling that is typically found posterior to the knee, not anterior. It's usually located behind the knee, hence the name. So, option B is incorrect. 3. The patellar tap, also known as the patellar tap test or patellar percussion, is a clinical test used to assess for joint effusion (fluid accumulation) in the knee joint. It involves tapping the patella (kneecap) to detect fluid. This makes option C correct. 4. 'Knock knee' deformity, also known as genu varum, is a condition where the knees are bowed outward, making it difficult to walk or stand. It is not due to bilateral genu varum (which would imply both knees bowing inward). This makes option D incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
