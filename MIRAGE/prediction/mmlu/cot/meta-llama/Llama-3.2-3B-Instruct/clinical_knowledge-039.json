    "predict": "To solve this problem, we need to know the specific formula for calculating energy expenditure based on oxygen consumption. The most commonly used formula is the Harris-Benedict equation, which is an estimate of basal metabolic rate (BMR) and can be used for physical activity. For physical activity, we use the following formula: Energy expenditure (EE) = (BMR x activity factor) For an athlete, we can use the following activity factor for a moderate-intensity exercise (which is the case here): EE = (BMR x 1.55) However, we don't know the BMR of the athlete. But we can use the fact that the mean rate of oxygen consumption (VO2) is 2 l/min. We know that 1 l/min of oxygen consumption is approximately equal to 10 kcal/min (since 1 liter of oxygen at 20\u00b0C and 1 atm contains 10 kcal). Therefore, the energy expenditure is approximately equal to the oxygen consumption multiplied by 10 kcal/l. EE = 2 l/min * 10 kcal/l = 20 kcal/min Now we need to convert kcal/min to kJ/min. We know that 1 kcal is approximately equal to 4.184 kJ. EE = 20 kcal/min * 4.184 kJ/kcal = 83.68 kJ/min Rounding this to the nearest answer choice, we get approximately 80 kJ/min.
