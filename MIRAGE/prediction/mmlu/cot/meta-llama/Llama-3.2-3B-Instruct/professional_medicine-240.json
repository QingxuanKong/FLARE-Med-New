    "question": "A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of abdominal pain. She has a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. She has thick nasal secretions. She says that her sweat is salty and crystallizes on her skin. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows epigastric tenderness. Genetic testing for the 36 most common mutations shows a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene. Which of the following best explains this patient's clinical phenotype?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR",
        "B": "The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier",
        "C": "The patient's CFTR mutation is unrelated to her clinical phenotype",
        "D": "The second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step: 1. **Patient's symptoms**: The patient has a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis, as well as thick nasal secretions and salty sweat that crystallizes on her skin. These symptoms are classic for Cystic Fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder that affects the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. 2. **Genetic testing**: The patient has a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene. The CFTR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which plays a critical role in the regulation of salt and water in and out of cells. Mutations in this gene can lead to the production of abnormal CFTR protein, resulting in the symptoms associated with CF. 3. **Understanding CFTR mutations**: CFTR mutations can be classified as either missense (resulting in the production of an abnormal protein), nonsense (resulting in a premature stop codon and a truncated protein), or deletion/insertion (resulting in the loss of a part of the protein). The G551D mutation is a missense mutation. 4. **Impact of a single CFTR mutation**: While a single CFTR mutation can cause CF, it is often not sufficient to cause the full range of symptoms associated with the disease. Many individuals with a single CFTR mutation are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. This is because the remaining functional CFTR protein can compensate for the mutated protein. 5. **Considering the options**: - A. Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR: This is incorrect because, while one allele is necessary for the expression of the disease, the presence of only one mutated allele is often not sufficient to cause the full range of symptoms associated with CF. - B. The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier: This is incorrect because, although the patient has a detectable mutation, the presence of a single CFTR mutation does not necessarily make her an obligate carrier. - C. The patient's CFTR mutation is unrelated to her clinical phenotype: This is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are consistent with CF, and the G551D mutation is a known CF-causing mutation. - D. The second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained: This is the most plausible explanation. The patient has a detectable mutation (G551D), but the presence of a second, potentially more severe mutation, may have been missed by the genetic testing. **Answer:** ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are consistent with CF, and the presence of a single CFTR mutation may not be sufficient to cause the full range of symptoms. The patient's clinical phenotype suggests the presence of a second, potentially more severe mutation that was not detected by the genetic testing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" } ```",
