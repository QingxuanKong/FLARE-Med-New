This does not necessarily mean it's masked. - **B. redundant:** In genetics, redundant refers to genes or alleles that have the same function and can be expressed in the same way, but this term doesn't specifically relate to the concept of an allele being masked. - **C. repressed:** In genetics, repression refers to the process by which one gene or allele can prevent the expression of another gene or allele. This is a possible explanation for a masked allele. - **D. reclusive:** Reclusive refers to being withdrawn or avoiding social interaction, which has no relevance to genetics. 3. **Conclusion:** Based on the definitions and understanding of the terms, the correct answer is the term that directly relates to the concept of an allele being hidden or prevented from being expressed. Here's the output in JSON format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An allele that is masked is referred to as repressed, as it is prevented from being expressed due to the presence of another allele.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ```",
