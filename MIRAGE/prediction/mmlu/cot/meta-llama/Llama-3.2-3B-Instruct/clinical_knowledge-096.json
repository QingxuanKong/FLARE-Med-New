    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To find the micrograms in each dose, we need to first convert the given dose from milligrams to micrograms. 1 milligram (mg) is equal to 1000 micrograms (mcg). Given dose: 1.5 mg Now, we'll convert milligrams to micrograms: 1.5 mg * 1000 mcg/mg = 1500 mcg Since the dose is divided into three equal parts, we'll divide the total micrograms by 3: 1500 mcg / 3 = 500 mcg Therefore, each dose is 500 mcg. Here's the step-by-step thinking in json format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To convert milligrams to micrograms, we multiply 1.5 mg by 1000 mcg/mg. This gives us 1500 mcg. Then, we divide the total micrograms by 3 to find the micrograms in each dose. 1500 mcg / 3 = 500 mcg. Therefore, each dose is 500 mcg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" } ```",
