    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to identify the accessory organ of the gastrointestinal system responsible for secreting insulin. The first step is to understand what insulin is. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels by facilitating glucose uptake in cells. The next step is to identify organs in the gastrointestinal system that are involved in hormone secretion. The adrenal glands (A) are part of the endocrine system but are not directly involved in glucose regulation. The gallbladder (B) stores bile and releases it into the small intestine to aid in fat digestion. The liver (C) plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism, but it does not secrete insulin. Finally, the pancreas (D) is known for producing hormones that regulate blood sugar levels, including insulin. Therefore, the pancreas is the correct answer as it is the accessory organ of the gastrointestinal system responsible for secreting insulin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
