    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the physiological changes that occur in the body during intense exercise, such as soccer. When athletes engage in high-intensity exercise, their muscles break down glucose to produce energy, leading to increased lactic acid production. This lactic acid is converted to lactate, which is then transported to the muscles and bloodstream. As a result, blood lactate concentration increases. In the context of soccer, the game is divided into two halves, with each half lasting 45 minutes. Given that the intensity of the game is high throughout, the blood lactate concentration is expected to increase as the game progresses. This is because the body needs to adapt to the increasing energy demands of the game. Therefore, we can expect the blood lactate concentration to be higher at the end of the game than at the end of the first half. The other options do not accurately reflect the expected physiological changes during intense exercise. Option A is incorrect because blood lactate concentration can exceed 3 mM during intense exercise. Option B is incorrect because blood lactate concentration is expected to increase as the game progresses, not decrease. Option A is also incorrect because it suggests that blood lactate concentration remains stable throughout the game, which is not the case during intense exercise. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
