    "question": "A race car attempting to jump a series of 8 buses is set up on a flat track with a ramp at the end. Engineers assigned to the project have determined that, in order to jump the buses, the car must reach a velocity of 130 km/h. If the distance of the track is 50m, at what rate must the car accelerate to reach this velocity?",
    "options": {
        "A": "13 m/s^2",
        "B": "26 m/s^2",
        "C": "7 m/s^2",
        "D": "17 m/s^2"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To solve this problem, we need to use the equation of motion: v^2 = u^2 + 2as, where v is the final velocity (130 km/h), u is the initial velocity (0 m/s), a is the acceleration, and s is the distance (50 m). First, we need to convert the final velocity from km/h to m/s: 130 km/h = 130 * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 36.11 m/s Now, we can plug in the values into the equation: (36.11 m/s)^2 = 0^2 + 2 * a * 50 m Simplifying the equation: 1299.2321 = 100 a Now, divide both sides by 100: a = 12.99321 m/s^2 Rounding to two decimal places, we get: a \u2248 13.01 m/s^2 However, since the answer choices are in integer values, we can approximate it to 13 m/s^2. Therefore, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we used the equation of motion v^2 = u^2 + 2as, where v is the final velocity (130 km/h), u is the initial velocity (0 m/s), a is the acceleration, and s is the distance (50 m). We converted the final velocity from km/h to m/s, then solved for a. The result is approximately 13 m/s^2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
