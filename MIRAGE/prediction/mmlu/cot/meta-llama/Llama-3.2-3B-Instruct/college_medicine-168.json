    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the physiological response to intermittent high-intensity exercise. When an individual engages in high-intensity exercise, their body's primary goal is to provide energy to the muscles. During this process, the body breaks down stored glucose (glycogen) and releases it into the bloodstream. This is known as glycogenolysis. Additionally, the liver also releases stored glucose (gluconeogenesis) into the bloodstream to meet the increased energy demands. However, during high-intensity exercise, the body's primary source of energy is the breakdown of fatty acids (lipolysis) and the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) from these fatty acids. The production of ATP is more efficient than glucose oxidation, which is why high-intensity exercise tends to deplete glycogen stores more quickly. Considering these physiological responses, the blood glucose concentration during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high-intensity exercise will not remain unchanged (B) or fall to hypoglycaemic levels (D), as the body is actively breaking down glycogen and producing glucose to meet the increased energy demands. Furthermore, the glucose concentration will not frequently rise by 1 - 3 mM (A) as this is a minor fluctuation. Instead, the glucose concentration will frequently fall by 1 - 3 mM due to the increased breakdown of glycogen and the use of alternative energy sources like fatty acids. This is because the body is prioritizing energy production from fatty acids over glucose oxidation during high-intensity exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
