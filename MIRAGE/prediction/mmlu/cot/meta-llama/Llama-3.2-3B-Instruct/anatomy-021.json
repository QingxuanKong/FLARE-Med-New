    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the anatomy of the intercostal nerves and their relationship with the ribs. Intercostal nerves are branches of the thoracic nerves that supply the intercostal spaces between the ribs. The intercostal nerves run along the inferior surface of the ribs and are located between the ribs, not deep to or superficial to the ribs. The correct location of the intercostal nerves is between the ribs, and they are not attached to the superior or inferior borders of the ribs. Therefore, the correct answer is related to their position between the ribs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
