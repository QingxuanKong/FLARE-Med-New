    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option one by one. Option A: Back pain is an uncommon complaint. This statement is false. Back pain is one of the most common complaints in the world, with a wide range of causes and a significant impact on quality of life. Option B: Schober's test is designed to quantify the flexion of the lumbar spine. This statement is true. Schober's test is a clinical test used to assess the flexibility of the lumbar spine, specifically the range of motion in the lumbar region. It involves measuring the distance between two points on the spine to quantify the degree of flexion. Option C: Ankylosing spondylitis is a cause of hypermobility of the spine. This statement is false. Ankylosing spondylitis is actually a cause of spinal stiffness and fusion, leading to reduced mobility of the spine, not hypermobility. Option D: Pregnancy is a cause of loss of lordosis of the lumbar spine. This statement is false. Pregnancy can cause a temporary increase in lordosis of the lumbar spine due to the weight gain and changes in posture, but it is not typically associated with a loss of lordosis. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
