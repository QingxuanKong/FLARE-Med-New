    "predict": "To determine where fertilization of an ovum by a spermatozoon occurs, let's break down the process step by step: 1. **Ovulation**: The process begins with ovulation, where a mature ovum (egg) is released from the **ovary** (C) into the **fallopian tube** (B). This usually occurs in the middle of the menstrual cycle. 2. **Perivittular space**: After ovulation, the released ovum travels through the **fallopian tube**, where it is surrounded by the perivittular space, a fluid-filled region that provides nourishment and protection. 3. **Fertilization**: Fertilization typically occurs when a spermatozoon (sperm) encounters the ovum in the **fallopian tube**. The sperm must swim through the cervical mucus and then through the fallopian tube to reach the ovum. 4. **Zona pellucida**: The ovum is surrounded by a protective layer called the zona pellucida. Sperm must penetrate this layer to fertilize the ovum. Considering these steps, the correct location for fertilization of an ovum by a spermatozoon is in the **fallopian tube**. Here is the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fertilization of an ovum by a spermatozoon occurs in the fallopian tube, where the ovum is released from the ovary and travels through the perivittular space. The sperm must swim through the cervical mucus and then through the fallopian tube to reach the ovum.
