    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down each option in relation to the definition of anaerobic metabolism.\\n\\nOption A: Anaerobic metabolism does involve the use of ADP, as it is a key molecule in the process of generating ATP. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\\n\\nOption B: Anaerobic metabolism can utilize glycogen as a substrate, as glycogen is broken down into glucose, which can then be converted into ATP without oxygen. However, it's not a defining characteristic of anaerobic metabolism. This option is partially correct but not a definitive definition.\\n\\nOption C: Anaerobic metabolism is indeed characterized by the generation of ATP without the use of oxygen. This is the correct definition of anaerobic metabolism.\\n\\nOption D: This option is similar to option C and also correctly states that anaerobic metabolism occurs in the absence of available oxygen. However, option C is a more concise and direct definition.\\n\\nAnswer: C\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
