    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down the process of quiet inspiration. Quiet inspiration, also known as diaphragmatic breathing, is the process of breathing in without making any noise. This type of breathing is characterized by the movement of the diaphragm, which is the primary muscle involved in breathing. When we breathe quietly, the diaphragm descends, increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity and allowing air to flow into the lungs. The internal intercostal muscles, which are located between the ribs, also play a role in quiet inspiration. They help to pull the ribs downward, further increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity and allowing the diaphragm to move more effectively. The external intercostal muscles, on the other hand, are primarily involved in forced expiration, not quiet inspiration. Therefore, during quiet inspiration, the diaphragm and internal intercostal muscles are the primary muscles that are active.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
