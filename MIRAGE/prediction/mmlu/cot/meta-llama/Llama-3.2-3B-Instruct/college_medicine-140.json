    "question": "There are five stages of mitosis that must be carried out correctly for a cell to properly divide. Match the stage of mitosis with its proper component:\nProphase \u2014 Dissolution of nucleoli",
    "options": {
        "A": "Metaphase \u2014 Formation of two distinct nuclear membranes",
        "B": "Cytokinesis \u2014 Separation of sister chromatids to their respective poles",
        "C": "Telophase \u2014 Formation of the equatorial plate",
        "D": "Anaphase \u2014 Separation of the cytoplasm and organelles"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To match the stage of mitosis with its proper component, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. **Prophase**: During prophase, several changes occur in the cell. The chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, the nuclear envelope begins to break down, and the nucleolus disappears. However, the dissolution of the nucleolus is not the primary characteristic of prophase. Instead, the nucleolus is broken down and its components are dispersed. This matches the description given in the question. 2. **Metaphase**: In metaphase, the chromosomes line up at the center of the cell, attached to the spindle fibers. This is not related to the formation of two distinct nuclear membranes. 3. **Cytokinesis**: Cytokinesis is the process of cell division that occurs after mitosis is complete, where the cytoplasm divides and the cell splits into two daughter cells. It is not related to the separation of sister chromatids. 4. **Telophase**: During telophase, the nuclear envelope begins to reform around each set of chromosomes, and the chromosomes uncoil to form chromatin. The equatorial plate is not formed during telophase; rather, it is a feature of cytokinesis. 5. **Anaphase**: In anaphase, the sister chromatids separate to their respective poles of the cell. This is not related to the separation of cytoplasm and organelles. Considering the given descriptions, the correct answer is: ``` {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prophase is the stage where the dissolution of nucleoli occurs, but in this case, the correct answer is actually Anaphase where sister chromatids are separated, however, the question asks for the stage of dissolution of nucleoli which is actually in prophase but not the best match for the given options, the closest correct answer is Anaphase - Separation of sister chromatids to their respective poles, which is not exactly what is asked but the closest match from the provided options is Anaphase\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"} ``` However, the correct answer based on the options given is not a perfect match, the closest correct answer is Anaphase - Separation of sister chromatids to their respective poles, but the question specifically asks for the stage of dissolution of nucleoli which is actually in prophase, the closest correct answer is Anaphase.",
