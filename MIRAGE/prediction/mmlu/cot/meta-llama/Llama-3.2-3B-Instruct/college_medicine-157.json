A young macaque monkey learning to rinse off food in the ocean from an older monkey, even when the food is not covered in dirt or sand.\nII. A child learning the rules of baseball from a parent.\nIII. A new group of inductees in a military organization experiencing hazing rituals from older students, which they then later carry out on new recruits.",
    "options": {
        "A": "I only",

        "C": "I and III only",
        "D": "II and III only"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's analyze each option step by step: I. A young macaque monkey learning to rinse off food in the ocean from an older monkey, even when the food is not covered in dirt or sand. - This is an example of transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture because the monkey is learning a behavior (rinsing off food) that is not necessary for survival but is a learned habit or tradition. This behavior is passed down through generations and is not necessarily tied to a specific practical need. II. A child learning the rules of baseball from a parent. - This is also an example of transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture because the child is learning a set of rules and norms that are not necessary for immediate survival but are part of a cultural tradition. The rules of baseball are a learned behavior that is passed down through generations. III. A new group of inductees in a military organization experiencing hazing rituals from older students, which they then later carry out on new recruits. - This is an example of transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture as well, as the inductees are learning a set of behaviors and norms that are specific to the military organization. These behaviors are passed down through generations and are a part of the organization's culture. Given that all three options (I, II, and III) are examples of transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"All three options are examples of transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture, so the correct answer cannot be A (I only), B (III only), or C (I and III only). The correct answer must be the option that includes all three options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. II and III only\"}",
