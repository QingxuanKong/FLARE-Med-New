    "question": "Pregnancy tests are extremely sensitive and function by detecting levels of B-hCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, in urine. This hormone is secreted by what tissue, and what is its function?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Corpus luteum, self-maintenance",
        "B": "Endometrium, cell division",
        "C": "Blastocyst, increase in blood flow",
        "D": "Blastocyst, corpus luteum maintenance"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the role of B-hCG in pregnancy and where it is produced. B-hCG is a hormone produced during pregnancy, and it plays a crucial role in maintaining the corpus luteum, which is a temporary endocrine structure in the female ovaries. The corpus luteum is responsible for producing progesterone, a hormone necessary for pregnancy maintenance. After ovulation, the empty follicle in the ovary transforms into the corpus luteum, which then secretes progesterone to prepare the uterine lining for a fertilized egg. B-hCG, on the other hand, is produced by the blastocyst, which is the early stage of the embryo after implantation into the uterine lining. The blastocyst produces B-hCG as it implants into the uterine lining and begins to establish itself as a pregnancy. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that mentions the corpus luteum and its function in maintaining pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
