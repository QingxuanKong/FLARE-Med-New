    "predict": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Understanding the Genotype**: We have two parents with the genotype AaBbCc. This means: - Aa is one parent's genotype (homozygous for one allele of A and one allele of a different allele) - Bb is the other parent's genotype (homozygous for one allele of B and one allele of a different allele) - Cc is the genotype of the second parent (homozygous for one allele of C and one allele of a different allele) 2. **Possible Genotypes of Offspring**: We need to determine the possible genotypes of the offspring. Since the parents are heterozygous for each gene (AaBbCc), the offspring can inherit any combination of alleles from their parents. The possible genotypes of the offspring are: - AA (homozygous dominant for A) - Aa (heterozygous for A) - BB (homozygous dominant for B) - Bb (heterozygous for B) - CC (homozygous dominant for C) - Cc (heterozygous for C) 3. **Calculating the Probability of Each Genotype**: - The probability of an offspring inheriting the dominant allele (A, B, or C) is 0.5 (50%). - The probability of an offspring inheriting the recessive allele (a, b, or c) is also 0.5 (50%). 4. **Calculating the Frequency of Each Genotype**: - AA: 1/4 (0.25) - Aa: 2/4 (0.5) - BB: 1/4 (0.25) - Bb: 2/4 (0.5) - CC: 1/4 (0.25) - Cc: 2/4 (0.5) Now, let's calculate the frequency of the AABBCC genotype: - To be AABBCC, an offspring must inherit the A allele from the first parent (Aa) and the a allele from the second parent (Cc), and the B allele from the first parent (Aa) and the b allele from the second parent (Bb), and the C allele from the first parent (Aa) and the c allele from the second parent (Cc). - The probability of this specific combination is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16 or 0.0625. However, this calculation is for one specific combination of alleles. To find the total frequency of AABBCC, we need to consider the total number of ways this specific combination can occur. Since each allele can be inherited independently, the total number of ways is 2^3 = 8 (each of the three genes can be inherited in 2 ways: Aa or aa, Bb or bb, Cc or cc). So, the total frequency of AABBCC is 8 * 0.0625 = 0.5/64 or 1/128. Therefore, the frequency of AABBCC individuals from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals is 1/128. **Answer**: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The frequency of AABBCC individuals from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals can be calculated by considering the total number of ways the specific combination of alleles can occur and multiplying it by the probability of that combination. The final frequency is 1/128.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
