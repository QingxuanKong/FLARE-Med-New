DNA is composed of nucleotides, each consisting of a sugar molecule called deoxyribose, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T).\\n\\nThe base pairing rules in DNA are as follows: adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C).\\n\\nConsidering the options provided, we can eliminate uracil (D) as it is not a DNA base, but rather a RNA base that replaces thymine in RNA.\\n\\nNow, looking at the remaining options, A (cytosine) and B (guanine) are not the correct partners for adenine.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is the option that pairs adenine with thymine, which is C (thymine).\\n\\nSo, the answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
