    "question": "A couple comes for preconceptional genetic counseling because they both have a family history of \u03b1-thalassemia. The woman has a minimally decreased hemoglobin concentration. Genetic studies show a single gene deletion. The man has microcytic anemia and a two-gene deletion. If the two-gene deletion is in trans (one deletion on the maternal gene and one deletion on the paternal gene), which of the following percentages of their offspring will have a two-gene deletion?",
    "options": {
        "A": "0%",
        "B": "25%",
        "C": "50%",
        "D": "75%"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Understanding \u03b1-thalassemia**: \u03b1-thalassemia is a genetic disorder caused by the deletion or mutation of one or more of the four \u03b1-globin genes that are responsible for producing the \u03b1-globin subunit of hemoglobin. The severity of the disorder is directly related to the number of genes deleted or mutated. 2. **Family history and inheritance**: Both parents have a family history of \u03b1-thalassemia, which suggests that they are likely carriers of the disorder. The woman has a minimally decreased hemoglobin concentration, which is consistent with a carrier state for \u03b1-thalassemia. 3. **Genetic studies**: The woman has a single gene deletion, which means she is a carrier of \u03b1-thalassemia but not severely affected. The man has microcytic anemia and a two-gene deletion, which suggests that he is also a carrier of \u03b1-thalassemia. 4. **Genotype of the couple**: - Woman: 1/3 deletion (carrier state) - Man: 2/3 deletion (carrier state) 5. **Possible genotypes of offspring**: - If the woman passes the normal gene (1/3) to the offspring, the offspring will be a carrier of \u03b1-thalassemia (1/3). - If the woman passes the deleted gene (2/3) to the offspring, the offspring will be affected with \u03b1-thalassemia (2/3). - The same applies to the man; he can pass the normal gene (1/3) or the deleted gene (2/3) to the offspring. 6. **Possible genotypes of the offspring**: - Normal genotype: 1/9 (1/3 x 1/3) - Carrier genotype: 4/9 (1/3 x 2/3 + 2/3 x 1/3) - Affected genotype: 4/9 (2/3 x 2/3) 7. **Conclusion**: Since the question asks for the percentage of offspring with a two-gene deletion, we need to consider the probability of inheriting two deleted genes from each parent. The probability of inheriting two deleted genes is the product of the probabilities of inheriting a deleted gene from each parent. In this case, the probability is (2/3) x (2/3) = 4/9. Therefore, the percentage of offspring with a two-gene deletion is 4/9 x 100% = 44.44%, which is closest to option C. 50% is not possible because the woman has only one deleted gene.",
