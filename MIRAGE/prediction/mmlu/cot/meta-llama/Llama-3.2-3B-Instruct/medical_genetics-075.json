    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the incorrect statement about Hirschsprung disease, let's evaluate each option step by step.\\n\\nOption A: Hirschsprung disease is indeed associated with various genetic syndromes, and Down syndrome is one of them. Individuals with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing Hirschsprung disease. So, this statement is correct.\\n\\nOption B: Hirschsprung disease is more common in males than in females. The male-to-female ratio is approximately 4:1, making this statement correct.\\n\\nOption C: RET is a major susceptibility gene for Hirschsprung disease. Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are responsible for the majority of cases, making this statement correct.\\n\\nOption D: The statement that recurrence risks are greater for long segment disease than for short segment disease is incorrect. In fact, the risk of recurrence is higher for short segment disease than for long segment disease. This is because the genetic defects responsible for Hirschsprung disease are more likely to be inherited in a dominant pattern, which increases the risk of recurrence in cases of short segment disease.\\n\\nSo, the incorrect statement about Hirschsprung disease is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
