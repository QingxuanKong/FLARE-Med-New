    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the process of endochondral ossification. Endochondral ossification is a process where cartilage templates are gradually replaced by bone tissue. This process occurs in certain bones that are formed during embryonic development and growth. The bones that undergo endochondral ossification are typically long bones, such as those found in the limbs, pelvis, and spine. The ribs and sternum are unique in that they do not undergo endochondral ossification. Instead, they develop through intramembranous ossification. The clavicle, on the other hand, undergoes a combination of both intramembranous and endochondral ossification. The vertebrae, however, do undergo endochondral ossification, as they develop from cartilaginous templates. With this information in mind, let's evaluate the options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
