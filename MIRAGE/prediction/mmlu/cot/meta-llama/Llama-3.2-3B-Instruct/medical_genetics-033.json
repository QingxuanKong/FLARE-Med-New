    "question": "A cross between two true breeding lines one with dark blue flowers and one with bright white flowers produces F1 offspring that are light blue. When the F1 progeny are selfed a 1:2:1 ratio of dark blue to light blue to white flowers is observed. What genetic phenomenon is consistent with these results?",

        "A": "epistasis",
        "B": "incomplete dominance",

    "predict": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Identify the parents' genotypes and phenotypes:** - The dark blue flower line can be represented as \"Bb\" (one allele for blue, b for white) since it's true breeding. - The bright white flower line can be represented as \"bb\" (both alleles for white). 2. **Determine the F1 generation's genotype and phenotype:** - Since the F1 offspring are light blue, they must have one \"B\" allele (for blue) and one \"b\" allele (for white). Thus, their genotype is \"Bb\". 3. **Analyze the F1 progeny's selfing:** - When the F1 offspring are selfed, they will produce offspring that are the genotype \"Bb\". - The possible genotypes and phenotypes of the F2 generation are: - \"BB\" (dark blue, 1/4) - \"Bb\" (light blue, 2/4) - \"bb\" (white, 1/4) - This results in a 1:2:1 ratio of dark blue to light blue to white flowers. 4. **Examine the options:** - **Incomplete dominance (B)**: Incomplete dominance occurs when neither allele masks the other completely, resulting in a phenotype that is a blend of the two parents' phenotypes. However, the F1 offspring are not a blend of dark blue and white, but rather a light blue phenotype, suggesting that the \"B\" allele is dominant over \"b\". - **Codominance (C)**: Codominance occurs when both alleles have an equal effect on the phenotype, resulting in a unique combination of the two alleles. This does not match the observed 1:2:1 ratio. - **Epistasis (A)**: Epistasis is a phenomenon where the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of another gene. While epistasis can lead to complex interactions, the simple 1:2:1 ratio observed in this case suggests a more straightforward Mendelian inheritance pattern. - **Inbreeding depression (D)**: Inbreeding depression refers to a decrease in fitness due to inbreeding. This option does not explain the 1:2:1 ratio of phenotypes in the F2 generation. 5. **Conclusion:** - Based on the observed 1:2:1 ratio and the fact that the F1 offspring are light blue, the phenomenon that is consistent with these results is **incomplete dominance**. However, this conclusion might seem counterintuitive since the F1 offspring are not a blend of the two parents' phenotypes. A closer examination reveals that the F1 offspring (Bb) are indeed the result of incomplete dominance, where the \"B\" allele is dominant over the \"b\" allele. The 1:2:1 ratio in the F2 generation arises because the \"B\" allele is dominant, and the \"b\" allele is recessive. The F1 offspring (Bb) can produce both \"BB\" and \"Bb\" genotypes, resulting in the observed phenotypic ratio. Here's the final answer in JSON format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The observed 1:2:1 ratio and the fact that the F1 offspring are light blue suggest that the 'B' allele is dominant over the 'b' allele. This is consistent with incomplete dominance, where the 'B' allele masks the effect of the 'b' allele, resulting in a light blue phenotype. The F1 offspring (Bb) can produce both 'BB' and 'Bb' genotypes, leading to the observed phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" } ```",
