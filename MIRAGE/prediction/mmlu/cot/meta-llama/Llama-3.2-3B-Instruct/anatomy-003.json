Motor neurons are derived from the neural tube, specifically from the ectoderm.\\nB. Skeletal muscles are derived from the mesoderm, which is also a germ layer, but it's different from ectomesenchyme.\\nC. Melanocytes are derived from the neural crest, which is a subset of ectoderm.\\nD. Sweat glands are also derived from the neural crest, which is a subset of ectoderm.\\nGiven the information, the correct answer is not among the options, as none of the given options are directly derived from ectomesenchyme. However, based on the closest relation, we can deduce that none of the options are directly derived from ectomesenchyme.\\nBut since we have to choose one, the closest relation to ectomesenchyme is option C. Melanocytes, as it is derived from the neural crest, which is a subset of ectoderm that can also give rise to mesenchymal cells, but it is not the best answer.\\nHowever, if we have to choose, I would say option C, as it is the closest relation to ectomesenchyme, but please note that this is not a perfect answer and ectomesenchyme itself is not among the options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
