    "question": "Which of the following statements concerning a sarcomere of a striated muscle (such as skeletal muscle) is correct?",
    "options": {
        "A": "During contraction H zones become elongated.",
        "B": "In the relaxed position tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin.",
        "C": "Each myosin helical tail contains an actinbinding site and an ATP-hydrolyzing site.",
        "D": "The proteins troponin and tropomyosin constitute the thick and thin filaments, respectively."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the structure and function of a sarcomere in striated muscle (such as skeletal muscle) step by step: 1. **Understanding the components of a sarcomere:** - Thick filaments are composed of myosin. - Thin filaments are composed of actin. - The thick and thin filaments are organized in a highly ordered fashion within the sarcomere. 2. **Relaxed state of the sarcomere:** - In the relaxed state, the myosin heads are bound to the actin filaments but are not attached to the actin. - Tropomyosin blocks the myosin binding sites on the actin filaments. 3. **Contractile state of the sarcomere:** - When the muscle contracts, tropomyosin moves away from the myosin binding sites on the actin filaments. - This exposes the myosin binding sites, allowing myosin heads to bind to the actin and initiate contraction. Given these points, let's evaluate the options: A. **During contraction H zones become elongated.** - Incorrect. The A bands (or H zones) become shorter, not longer, as the sarcomere shortens during contraction. B. **In the relaxed position tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin.** - Correct. This accurately describes the relaxed state of the sarcomere. C. **Each myosin helical tail contains an actinbinding site and an ATP-hydrolyzing site.** - Incorrect. Myosin heads contain an actin-binding site and an ATP-hydrolyzing site, but not within the helical tail; rather, these sites are located at the myosin head itself. D. **The proteins troponin and tropomyosin constitute the thick and thin filaments, respectively.** - Incorrect. Tropomyosin is associated with the thin filaments, and troponin is associated with the thin filaments as well, but it's part of the troponin-tropomyosin complex that regulates the interaction between myosin and actin. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The correct answer is B. In the relaxed position tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
