    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's consider the potential causes of skin excoriation, which is a type of skin damage that results in small, superficial wounds or abrasions. Skin excoriations can be caused by various factors, but in the context of ostomy care, one common cause is friction and irritation from the stoma or the pouch. Now, let's evaluate each option: A. A well-fitting pouch: A well-fitting pouch is actually a desirable condition, as it reduces the risk of skin irritation and excoriation. So, this option is unlikely to be the correct answer. B. Changing the pouch every day: While frequent changes to the pouch can be irritating, it is not the most common cause of skin excoriation. However, it may contribute to skin irritation if the skin is not properly cleaned and prepared before changing the pouch. C. Leakage of effluent onto peristomal skin: This is a common cause of skin excoriation, especially if the leakage is frequent or severe. The urine or feces can cause chemical burns, leading to excoriation and skin damage. D. The use of unscented soap to cleanse the skin: While using unscented soap is generally recommended to minimize skin irritation, it is not a direct cause of skin excoriation. In fact, using gentle, fragrance-free cleansers can help prevent skin irritation. Based on the analysis, the most likely cause of skin excoriation in the context of ostomy care is leakage of effluent onto peristomal skin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
