    "predict": "To solve this question, we need to consider the energy yield from the reduction of FADH2 and NADH+H in the electron transport chain. 1. **FADH2**: When FADH2 is reduced to FAD, it yields approximately 1.5 ATP per molecule. 2. **NADH+H**: When NADH+H is reduced to NAD+, it yields approximately 2.5 ATP per molecule. Since the question asks about the total energy yield, we need to sum the ATP yield from both FADH2 and NADH+H. 3. **Calculating ATP yield**: - FADH2: 1.5 ATP - NADH+H: 2.5 ATP Total ATP yield = 1.5 + 2.5 = 4 ATP Therefore, the pairs of electrons carried in the form of FADH2 and NADH+H collectively contain enough free energy to rephosphorylate **4 ATP**. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the total ATP yield, we need to sum the ATP yield from FADH2 (1.5 ATP) and NADH+H (2.5 ATP), resulting in a total of 4 ATP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
