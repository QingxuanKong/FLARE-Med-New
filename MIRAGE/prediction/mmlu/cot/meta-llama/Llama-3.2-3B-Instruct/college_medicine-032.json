    "predict": "To answer this question, let's analyze the changes that occur when sound travels from one medium to another. When sound travels from one medium to another, the following changes can occur: 1. **Velocity (Speed)**: The velocity of sound changes when it enters a denser medium. In a denser medium, the particles are closer together, which increases the number of collisions between particles and the sound wave. As a result, the velocity of the sound wave decreases. So, the velocity changes. 2. **Intensity**: The intensity of the sound wave remains the same when it enters a denser medium. The intensity of a sound wave is determined by the energy transmitted per unit area, and this does not change when the medium changes. The particles in a denser medium may cause more collisions with the sound wave, but the energy transmitted remains the same. 3. **Frequency**: The frequency of the sound wave remains the same when it enters a denser medium. The frequency of a sound wave is determined by the source of the sound and does not change when the medium changes. 4. **Wavelength**: The wavelength of the sound wave changes when it enters a denser medium. In a denser medium, the velocity decreases, but the frequency remains the same. Since the velocity and frequency are related by the speed equation (v = f\u03bb), when the velocity decreases, the wavelength must increase to maintain the same frequency. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When sound travels from one medium to another, the velocity and wavelength change, but the intensity and frequency remain the same. The question asks for the change that does NOT occur, and since the intensity remains the same, the correct answer is B. intensity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
