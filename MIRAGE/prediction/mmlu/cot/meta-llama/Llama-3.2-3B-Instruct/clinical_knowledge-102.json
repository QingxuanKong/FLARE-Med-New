    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To complete a bladder washout after a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), the goal is to remove any debris, blood, and irrigating solution from the bladder. The type of solution used for this purpose is crucial to prevent complications such as bladder irritation and infection. Solution R is specifically designed for TURP and contains an anticholinergic agent, oxybuprocaine, which helps to reduce bladder spasms and promote smooth irrigation. Normal saline is not suitable as it does not contain any anticholinergic agent and may cause bladder irritation. Solution G is not a standard solution used for TURP. Therefore, the best option is Solution R.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
