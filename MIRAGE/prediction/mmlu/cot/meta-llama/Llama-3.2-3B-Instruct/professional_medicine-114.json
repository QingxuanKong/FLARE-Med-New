    "question": "A 25-year-old woman who is 19 weeks pregnant comes to the office for a prenatal examination. Her father had classic hemophilia. A karyotype obtained from an amniotic fluid sample of the patient shows that the fetus is XY. Which of the following should you tell the patient regarding her infant?",
    "options": {
        "A": "The infant will neither have hemophilia nor be a carrier",
        "B": "The infant has a 50% risk for hemophilia",
        "C": "The infant has a 50% risk for being a carrier",
        "D": "The infant has a 75% risk for hemophilia"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To answer this question, we need to understand the genetic basis of hemophilia. Hemophilia A and B are X-linked recessive disorders, which means the genes responsible for these conditions are located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Given that the patient's father had classic hemophilia, it implies that he was affected and therefore had no Y chromosome, as hemophilia A and B are X-linked recessive and cannot be inherited from a Y chromosome. Since the patient's father had no Y chromosome, he must have been homozygous recessive for the gene that causes hemophilia, which is Xcc (where \"cc\" represents the recessive allele). Since the patient is 19 weeks pregnant, we can determine the possible genotypes of her fetus based on the fact that the karyotype shows the fetus is XY. Given that the patient's father was homozygous recessive (cc), there is a 50% chance that the patient is a carrier of the hemophilia gene (Xc) and a 50% chance that she is not (XX). When considering the possible genotypes of the fetus, there is a 50% chance that the fetus will inherit the Xc allele from the mother and thus be hemophilic (XcY), and a 50% chance that the fetus will inherit the normal X chromosome (XX) and not be hemophilic. Therefore, the infant has a 50% risk for being hemophilic and a 50% risk for not being hemophilic. Here is the response in the requested format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the risk of the infant having hemophilia, we need to understand the genetic basis of the disorder.
