    "question": "A new enzyme is found in a transgenic mice that participates in synthesis of an unknown product using two reactants. When using radiolabeled compounds to study the enzyme, it is found that the enzyme catalyzes a process that switches a nitrogen group on one reactant to the other reactant. Which of the following categories would this new enzyme fall under?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Oxidoreductase",
        "B": "Transferase",
        "C": "Hydrolase",
        "D": "Lyase"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To determine the category of the new enzyme, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step: 1. **Identify the key characteristics of the enzyme's action:** - The enzyme participates in the synthesis of an unknown product. - It uses two reactants. - It switches a nitrogen group from one reactant to the other. 2. **Understand the general functions of the enzyme categories given:** - **Oxidoreductases** (A) catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions, transferring electrons from one molecule to another. - **Transferases** (B) facilitate the transfer of a group from one molecule to another, which can include nitrogen-containing groups. - **Hydrolases** (C) catalyze reactions that break chemical bonds using water. - **Lyases** (D) catalyze reactions that form a double bond or ring structure by removing a group from one molecule. 3. **Analyze the specific action of the new enzyme:** - The enzyme switches a nitrogen group from one reactant to the other. This action is characteristic of a transfer reaction, as it involves the transfer of a group (in this case, a nitrogen-containing group) from one molecule to another. 4. **Match the enzyme's action to the correct category:** - Based on the analysis, the new enzyme's action best matches the definition of a **transferase**, as it involves the transfer of a nitrogen-containing group between reactants. 5. **Conclusion:** - The new enzyme falls under the category of a transferase. **Output:** ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The enzyme switches a nitrogen group from one reactant to the other, which is characteristic of a transfer reaction. This action matches the definition of a transferase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" } ```",
