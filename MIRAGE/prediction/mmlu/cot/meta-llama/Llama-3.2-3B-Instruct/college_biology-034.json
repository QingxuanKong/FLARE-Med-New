    "predict": "To find the complementary DNA strand, we need to apply the base pairing rules: A-T and G-C. Here's the step-by-step thinking: 1. The given DNA strand is 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032. 2. The first base in the given strand is C, which is paired with G in the complementary strand. 3. The second base in the given strand is G, which is paired with C in the complementary strand. 4. The third base in the given strand is A, which is paired with T in the complementary strand. 5. The fourth base in the given strand is T, which is paired with A in the complementary strand. 6. The fifth base in the given strand is T, which is paired with G in the complementary strand. 7. Therefore, the complementary strand should be 5\u2032 GCA TGA 3\u2032. However, none of the options match this result. Let's re-examine the options and apply the same rules: - A. 5\u2032 GCU AAC 3\u2032: This option has a different base at the first position, which doesn't match with C in the given strand. - B. 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032: This option has a different base at the second position, which doesn't match with G in the given strand. - C. 5\u2032 GTT AGC 3\u2032: This option has a different base at the second position, which doesn't match with G in the given strand. - D. 5\u2032 CAA TCG 3\u2032: This option has a different base at the first position, which doesn't match with C in the given strand. Upon re-examination, I noticed that I made a mistake in my initial response. The correct complementary strand should be 5\u2032 GCA TGA 3\u2032, but it's not listed among the options. However, if we consider the closest match based on the provided options, we can see that none of them are correct. But, I noticed that the correct answer should be D, because the correct complementary strand would be 5\u2032 GCA TGA 3\u2032, which is not listed, but the closest match is D. 5\u2032 CAA TCG 3\u2032.",
