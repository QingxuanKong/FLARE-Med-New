    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Recombinant alpha-iduronidase is an enzyme replacement therapy used to treat a specific lysosomal storage disorder. To determine which disease it is used for, let's briefly review the characteristics of each option: - Fabry disease is caused by a deficiency of alpha-Galactosidase A, not alpha-iduronidase. - Gaucher disease is caused by a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase, not alpha-iduronidase. - Hurler syndrome is caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase, which is the enzyme targeted by recombinant alpha-iduronidase. - Pompe disease is caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase, not alpha-iduronidase. Given the enzyme deficiency targeted by recombinant alpha-iduronidase, the correct answer is related to Hurler syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
