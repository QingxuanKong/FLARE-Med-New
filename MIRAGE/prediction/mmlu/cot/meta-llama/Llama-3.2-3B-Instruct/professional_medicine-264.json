    "question": "An 18-year-old primigravid woman comes for her initial prenatal visit at 16 weeks' gestation. She is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period but says that the pregnancy probably occurred immediately after she stopped taking oral contraceptives 5 months ago. Maternal serum \u03b1-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentration is increased to 3 multiples of the median. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration",
        "B": "Triple screening for MSAFP, serum \u03b2-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations",
        "C": "Ultrasonography",
        "D": "Amniocentesis for measurement of \u03b1-fetoprotein concentration"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with an increased MSAFP concentration, which is a marker for neural tube defects (NTDs). However, an isolated increase in MSAFP can also be seen in other conditions such as multiple gestations, gestational trophoblastic disease, and other fetal anomalies. Given that the patient is at 16 weeks' gestation, the next step should aim to further evaluate the cause of the elevated MSAFP level and assess fetal anatomy. Option A, repeating the MSAFP measurement, may not provide additional useful information as the result is already elevated. Option D, amniocentesis for measurement of \u03b1-fetoprotein concentration, is an invasive procedure and should not be performed as the first line of investigation. Option B, triple screening for MSAFP, serum \u03b2-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations, is a non-invasive screening test that can help identify the cause of the elevated MSAFP level. However, it is not diagnostic and may not provide information on fetal anatomy. Option C, ultrasonography, is the most appropriate next step in management. It will allow for the evaluation of fetal anatomy, including the measurement of the nasal bone, which is a marker for NTDs, and the assessment of other fetal structures. This will help determine if the elevated MSAFP level is due to a specific fetal anomaly or if other factors are at play. Additionally, ultrasonography can also be used to assess the gestational age and confirm the presence of multiple gestations or other conditions that may be contributing to the elevated MSAFP level.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
