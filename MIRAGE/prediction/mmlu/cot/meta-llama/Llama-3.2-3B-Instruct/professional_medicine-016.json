    "question": "A 5-year-old boy is admitted to the hospital because of a 1-week history of fever and increasingly severe abdominal discomfort. At the age of 7 months, he was treated for osteomyelitis caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. He has been admitted to the hospital three times during the past 4 years for severe pneumonia. He appears moderately ill. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Abdominal examination shows an enlarged, tender liver. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows an intrahepatic abscess. Culture of the abscess fluid grows Staphylococcus aureus. Further analysis shows failure of the neutrophils to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus. This patient has an increased susceptibility to infection as a result of which of the following abnormalities?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Failure of leukocytes to migrate between endothelial cells",
        "B": "Failure of leukocytes to roll along the endothelial surface",
        "C": "Inability of leukocytes to ingest microorganisms",
        "D": "Inability of leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient has a history of recurrent infections (osteomyelitis, pneumonia, and now an intrahepatic abscess), which suggests a problem with the immune system, particularly with the body's ability to fight off infections. 2. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient's failure to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to Staphylococcus aureus indicates an issue with the phagocytic function of neutrophils. Normally, when neutrophils recognize pathogens, they release reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill the microorganism. This process is crucial for the elimination of pathogens. 3. **Options Analysis**: - **A. Failure of leukocytes to migrate between endothelial cells**: This refers to the process of diapedesis, which is the movement of leukocytes through the endothelial lining of blood vessels to reach the site of infection. While important, this is not directly related to the inability to kill intracellular pathogens. - **B. Failure of leukocytes to roll along the endothelial surface**: This is the initial step in the recruitment of leukocytes to the site of infection, known as the \"rolling\" phase. It is mediated by selectins and integrins. Again, not directly related to the killing of pathogens. - **C. Inability of leukocytes to ingest microorganisms**: This refers to phagocytosis, the process by which neutrophils engulf and internalize pathogens. While important, this is not the issue described in the scenario. - **D. Inability of leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms**: This directly relates to the inability to undergo an oxidative burst, which is a critical mechanism for killing ingested pathogens within the phagosome. Given the patient's failure to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus, the most likely answer is related to the inability to kill intracellular microorganisms. **Answer Choice**: D",
