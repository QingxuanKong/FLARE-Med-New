DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a variety of symptoms, including congenital heart defects, thymic hypoplasia, parathyroid gland abnormalities, and cleft palate. It is often associated with a deletion in a specific region of the genome. The correct chromosome involved in DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome is a microdeletion syndrome that typically occurs on the short arm of a specific chromosome. This condition is also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. The deletion affects the region of the chromosome that contains several important genes involved in development and function of the thymus, parathyroid glands, and the development of the heart. The deletion is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern but can also occur spontaneously. The deletion is typically around 3 million base pairs in size and affects the region of the chromosome 22q11.2. Given this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is chromosome 22.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
