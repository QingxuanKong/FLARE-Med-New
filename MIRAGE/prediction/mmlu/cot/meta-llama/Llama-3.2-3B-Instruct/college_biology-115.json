    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking: To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. **Understanding the question**: We're asked about the mechanism of action of a competitive inhibitor. A competitive inhibitor is a type of enzyme inhibitor that binds to the active site of the enzyme, competing with the substrate for the same binding site. 2. **Analyzing option A**: Irreversibly forming covalent links with the enzyme - This is actually the mechanism of action of a covalent inhibitor, not a competitive inhibitor. Covalent inhibitors form a stable chemical bond with the enzyme, permanently inactivating it. 3. **Analyzing option B**: Irreversibly modifying some of the amino acid residues that help to comprise the enzyme's active site - This is also not a characteristic of competitive inhibition. While covalent modifications can occur, competitive inhibitors typically do not modify the enzyme's structure irreversibly. 4. **Analyzing option C**: Competing with the substrate molecule for the same enzyme but a different binding site than the substrate binding site - This is the definition of competitive inhibition. Competitive inhibitors bind to the active site of the enzyme, blocking the substrate from binding and thereby reducing enzyme activity. 5. **Analyzing option D**: Reversibly decreasing the number of enzyme molecules that are available to bind substrates - This is more characteristic of non-competitive inhibition, where the inhibitor binds to a site other than the active site and reduces enzyme activity without competing with the substrate. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Competitive inhibition is characterized by the inhibitor competing with the substrate for the same enzyme but a different binding site than the substrate binding site.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
