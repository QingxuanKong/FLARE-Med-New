    "question": "Hybrids between some related species of plants are sterile because the parent plants had different chromosome numbers. Occasionally the chromosome number of such a hybrid plant doubles spontaneously. Which of the following best describes the descendants of those plants with the double chromosome number?",
    "options": {
        "A": "The plant with the double chromosome number would be genetically defective and have no descendants.",
        "B": "The descendants would be at a selective advantage because of the increased ability to introgress.",
        "C": "The descendants would be reproductively successful because they could backcross with the parental species.",
        "D": "The descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Understanding the concept of hybrid sterility**: Hybrids between two species with different chromosome numbers are often sterile because the chromosomes cannot pair up correctly during meiosis, leading to abnormal gametes and, consequently, no viable offspring. 2. **Spontaneous doubling of chromosome number**: When a hybrid plant with a double chromosome number occurs, it means the plant has an extra set of chromosomes. This is often due to a process called polyploidy, where the plant's genome has doubled. 3. **Effect on recombination and meiosis**: In diploid organisms (with a normal number of chromosomes), meiosis involves the shuffling of chromosomes during gamete formation, which increases genetic diversity. However, in a tetraploid (having four sets of chromosomes) organism, the extra set of chromosomes can lead to abnormalities during meiosis, including failure to separate properly during meiosis I or meiosis II. This can result in abnormal gametes that are often non-viable. 4. **Recombination and backcrossing**: For a tetraploid organism to regain its reproductive fitness, it needs to produce viable gametes. This can occur if the extra set of chromosomes is not severely detrimental to the organism's viability. If the extra set of chromosomes is not a complete duplicate of the original set, it can still pair up with the parental chromosomes during meiosis, allowing for the production of viable gametes. Considering these points, let's evaluate the options: - A: Incorrect. The plant with the double chromosome number is not necessarily genetically defective; it's just polyploid. - B: Incorrect. The increased ability to introgress (interbreeding with another species) does not directly relate to the doubling of chromosome number. - C: Incorrect. The plant with a double chromosome number would not be able to backcross with the parental species because it's tetraploid and lacks the correct number of chromosomes to pair up with the diploid parental species. - D: Correct. The descendants of a plant with a double chromosome number can regain the ability to reproduce sexually if the extra set of chromosomes is not severely detrimental to the organism's viability and can pair up with the parental chromosomes during meiosis.
