The genes that allow the host bird species to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings to the detriment of their own offspring most likely remain in the gene pool of the population because",
    "options": {
        "A": "on average, the host birds' response allows them to rear their own young efficiently by feeding only those who indicate they are hungry",
        "B": "the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species",
        "C": "on average, little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, whether it is an interloper or one's own",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the reasoning step by step: 1. **Understanding the scenario**: Brood parasites like cuckoos exploit the host bird's instinctive response to the loud begging cues of a fledgling in their nest, causing the host to raise the cuckoo's young instead of their own. 2. **Considering the genetic basis**: The question asks about the genes that allow the host birds to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings. These genes must confer some benefit to the host birds, even if it's a temporary or indirect benefit. 3. **Analyzing the options**: - A: This option suggests that the host birds are only rearing their own young efficiently when they recognize the hunger cues of their own young. However, the cuckoo's loud begging cues are designed to mimic those of the host's own young, so this option doesn't explain why the host birds would benefit from rearing the cuckoo's young. - B: This option suggests that the duped bird's maximum fitness is not compromised by rearing an interloper. This is a key point, as it implies that the genes responsible for the host birds' behavior are not detrimental to their overall fitness. - C: While it's true that rearing a fledgling can be energetically costly, this option doesn't address the genetic basis of the host birds' behavior. - D: This option suggests that the maximum fitness of the cuckoo would be reduced if the host birds are duped into rearing its young. However, the question is asking about the host birds, not the cuckoo. 4. **Conclusion**: The most plausible explanation is that the genes allowing the host birds to be duped into rearing the cuckoo's young confer a benefit, specifically that the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when rearing an interloper of another species. This means that the host birds can still reproduce successfully even if they're temporarily diverting resources to raise a cuckoo's young. ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the genes that allow the host birds to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings.
