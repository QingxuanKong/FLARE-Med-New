    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down the term 'passive movements' and analyze each option given. Passive movements refer to movements that are induced by external forces, where the individual is not actively contracting their muscles to generate movement. This type of movement is often seen in joints where the joint is being moved by an external force, such as a therapist or healthcare professional. Now, let's evaluate each option: A. Movement with resistance, stretching at end of range: This option describes an active movement, not a passive one, as it involves the individual contracting their muscles to generate movement and resist the external force. B. Movement without resistance, stretching at end of range: This option aligns with the definition of passive movements. It describes a movement where the individual is not contracting their muscles, and the movement is induced by an external force, resulting in stretching at the end of the range. C. Movement with resistance, stopping at end of range: This option describes a type of movement that involves resistance, but it does not necessarily imply that the movement is passive. The fact that it stops at the end of the range does not necessarily mean it is passive. D. Movement without resistance, stopping at end of range: This option is partially correct in that it describes a movement without resistance, but the addition of'stopping at the end of range' does not necessarily imply passivity. The individual could be actively contracting their muscles to control the movement and stop it at the end of the range. Based on the analysis, the most accurate description of passive movements is option B: Movement without resistance, stretching at end of range.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
