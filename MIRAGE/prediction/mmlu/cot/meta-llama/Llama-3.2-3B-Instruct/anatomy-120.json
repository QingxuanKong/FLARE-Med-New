The small intestine is a long, thin tube-like structure that is divided into three main parts: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine, the jejunum is the middle part, and the ileum is the last part. The cecum is the beginning of the large intestine, and the ascending colon is part of the large intestine. The sigmoid colon is also part of the large intestine. Given these definitions, the only structure that is part of the small intestine is the ileum. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
