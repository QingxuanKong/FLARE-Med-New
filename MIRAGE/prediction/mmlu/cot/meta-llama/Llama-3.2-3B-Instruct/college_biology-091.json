    "question": "Phalloidin is a toxin made by the death cap mushroom. The toxin binds to actin subunits and disrupts actin function. Which of the following structures would be most directly affected by phalloidin?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Intermediate filaments",
        "B": "Collagen fibers",
        "C": "Microfilaments",
        "D": "Microtubules"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the information given and the options provided. Phalloidin is a toxin that disrupts actin function, and actin is a component of microfilaments. Microfilaments are one of the three main components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells, along with microtubules and intermediate filaments. Phalloidin's effect on actin function suggests that it primarily targets microfilaments. Now, let's evaluate the options: Option A, intermediate filaments, are not directly related to actin or phalloidin's mechanism of action. Intermediate filaments are a different component of the cytoskeleton and are not affected by phalloidin. Option B, collagen fibers, are not related to the cytoskeleton and are a type of structural protein found in connective tissue. Phalloidin's effect is on the cytoskeleton, not connective tissue. Option C, microfilaments, are directly related to actin and would be most affected by phalloidin's toxin. Phalloidin binds to actin subunits and disrupts actin function, which is the primary function of microfilaments. Option D, microtubules, are a different component of the cytoskeleton and are not directly affected by phalloidin's mechanism of action. Microtubules are involved in other cellular processes, such as cell division and intracellular transport, but are not the primary target of phalloidin. Given the information and analysis, the most directly affected structure by phalloidin is microfilaments, which are composed of actin.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
