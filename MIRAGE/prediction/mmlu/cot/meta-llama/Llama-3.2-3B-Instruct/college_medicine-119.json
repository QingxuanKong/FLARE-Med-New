They are sequences of nucleotide bases that code for specific amino acids during protein synthesis. The genetic code is read in triplets, and each codon specifies one of the 20 amino acids. Now, let's examine the options given:\\n\", \"option_a\": \"A. triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA.\", \"option_b\": \"B. quadruplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA.\", \"option_c\": \"C. triplet sequences of amino acids in polypeptide chains.\", \"option_d\": \"D. triplet sequences of deoxyribose sugars in DNA.\", \"answer\": \"A\"}",
