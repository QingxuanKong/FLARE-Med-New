    "predict": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Understanding X-linked recessive conditions**: In X-linked recessive conditions, the genes responsible for the condition are located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). Males are more likely to be affected because they have only one X chromosome, so if that chromosome carries the recessive allele, they will express the condition. 2. **Given frequency of affected males**: The frequency of males affected with the condition is 0.10, which means 10% of the male population has the condition. 3. **Expected frequency of affected females**: To find the expected frequency of affected females, we need to consider the following: - Females can be either homozygous recessive (rr), heterozygous (Rr), or homozygous dominant (RR). - The probability of a female being affected is the sum of the probabilities of being homozygous recessive (rr) and heterozygous (Rr). - Since the condition is X-linked recessive, the frequency of the recessive allele (r) is assumed to be the same in both males and females. Let's denote the frequency of the recessive allele (r) as 'p'. Then, the frequency of the dominant allele (R) is '1-p'. 4. **Calculating the probability of females being affected**: - The probability of a female being homozygous recessive (rr) is p^2, since both alleles must be recessive. - The probability of a female being heterozygous (Rr) is 2pr, since there are two possible ways to inherit the recessive allele (Rr or rR). - The probability of a female being affected is the sum of these two probabilities: p^2 + 2pr. 5. **Expected frequency of affected females**: Since the frequency of males affected is 0.10, we can assume that the frequency of the recessive allele (r) is also 0.10. Therefore, the frequency of the dominant allele (R) is 0.90. - p = 0.10 (frequency of the recessive allele) - 1-p = 0.90 (frequency of the dominant allele) - The expected frequency of affected females is p^2 + 2pr = 0.10^2 + 2(0.10)(0.90) = 0.01 + 0.18 = 0.19 However, we are only interested in the probability of females being affected, not the probability of the allele. Since the probability of a female being affected is the sum of the probabilities of being homozygous recessive and heterozygous, and the probability of being heterozygous is twice the probability of being homozygous recessive, the expected frequency of affected females can be calculated as half of the probability of being affected. - Expected frequency of affected females = (p^2 + 2pr) / 2 = (0.01 + 0.18) / 2 = 0.19 / 2 = 0.095 Rounding to 4 decimal places, the expected frequency of affected females is approximately 0.095, but since none of the options match this result, we will choose the closest answer. Given the available options, the closest answer is 0.01.",
