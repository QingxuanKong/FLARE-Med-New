    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which hormone is responsible for maintaining adequate serum levels of calcium in humans, let's analyze each option: 1. Thyroxine (A) is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland, primarily involved in regulating metabolism, growth, and development. While it does affect various bodily functions, it is not directly involved in calcium homeostasis. 2. Glucagon (B) is a hormone produced by the pancreas, which raises blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. It does not play a direct role in calcium regulation. 3. Growth hormone (C) is produced by the pituitary gland and regulates growth, body composition, and metabolism. While it does have some effects on bone density, it is not the primary hormone responsible for maintaining calcium levels. 4. Parathyroid hormone (D) is produced by the parathyroid glands, and its primary function is to regulate calcium levels in the blood. It increases calcium levels by stimulating the release of calcium from bones, increasing calcium absorption in the gut, and reducing calcium excretion by the kidneys. This hormone plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis in the body. Based on this analysis, the hormone responsible for maintaining adequate serum levels of calcium in humans is parathyroid hormone.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
