    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's break it down step by step. 1. The question is asking about a src oncogene and its function. 2. Src oncogene is a family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, which are enzymes that add phosphate groups to proteins. 3. The specific action of adding phosphate groups to proteins is known as phosphorylation. 4. Therefore, we need to find a protein that is a tyrosine kinase, as src oncogene is a tyrosine kinase. 5. Now, let's evaluate the options: - A. Protein phosphatase is the enzyme that removes phosphate groups from proteins, not adds them. - B. Adenylate cyclase is an enzyme that catalyzes the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP), not the addition of phosphate groups to proteins. - C. G protein-linked receptor is a type of receptor that activates G proteins, not a kinase that adds phosphate groups to proteins. - D. Tyrosine kinase is the correct answer, as it is a type of enzyme that adds phosphate groups to proteins. 6. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Tyrosine kinase.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
