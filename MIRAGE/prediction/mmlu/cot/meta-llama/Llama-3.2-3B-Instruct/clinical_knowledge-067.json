    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's evaluate each option individually and rule out incorrect statements based on medical knowledge.\\n\\nOption A: When associated with neck stiffness is always due to meningitis - This statement is not always true. Neck stiffness can be associated with various conditions, including tension headaches, sinusitis, and other infections, not just meningitis.\\n\\nOption B: Severe pain usually indicates a life-threatening cause - This statement is generally true. Severe headache, especially in certain populations (e.g., the elderly, young children, or those with a history of stroke), can be a symptom of a life-threatening condition such as a hemorrhagic stroke or a tumor.\\n\\nOption C: Temporal arteritis is strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis - This statement is incorrect. Temporal arteritis, also known as giant cell arteritis, is actually strongly associated with autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, but it is not a direct cause-and-effect relationship. It is more commonly associated with polymyalgia rheumatica.\\n\\nOption D: Tension headaches is a common cause of headache - This statement is true. Tension headaches are one of the most common types of headaches, often caused by muscle tension in the neck and scalp.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
