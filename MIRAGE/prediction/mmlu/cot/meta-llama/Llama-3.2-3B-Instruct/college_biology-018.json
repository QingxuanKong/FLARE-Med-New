    "options": {
        "A": "A DNA sequence that can move from one site in the genome to another without replicating",
        "B": "A DNA sequence that can be deleted from the genome without consequence",

        "D": "A DNA sequence that replicates via a protein intermediate"

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:\\n\\nOption A: A DNA sequence that can move from one site in the genome to another without replicating - This is a characteristic of retrotransposons, which are known to transpose (move) from one location to another in the genome without replicating themselves in the process. This option seems to accurately describe a retrotransposon.\\n\\nOption B: A DNA sequence that can be deleted from the genome without consequence - This option does not describe a retrotransposon, as retrotransposons are known to insert themselves into new locations in the genome, not to be deleted.\\n\\nOption C: A DNA sequence that replicates via an RNA intermediate - This is actually a characteristic of retroviruses, not retrotransposons. Retroviruses use an RNA intermediate to replicate and integrate into the host genome, but retrotransposons use a DNA intermediate.\\n\\nOption D: A DNA sequence that replicates via a protein intermediate - This option is not accurate for retrotransposons, as they do not require a protein intermediate for replication.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: A DNA sequence that can move from one site in the genome to another without replicating\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
