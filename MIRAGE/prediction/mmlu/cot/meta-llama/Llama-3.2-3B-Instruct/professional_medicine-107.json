Examination reveals exophthalmos, inflammation of the periorbital tissue and conjunctivae, a heart rate of 140/min, and warm, velvety skin. An MRI of the head and orbits will most likely reveal",
    "options": {
        "A": "calcification of the orbit",
        "B": "diffuse enlargement of the rectus muscles",
        "C": "dilated ventricles",
        "D": "lymphoma"

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including heat intolerance, weight loss, tachycardia, and diffuse goiter. The presence of exophthalmos, inflammation of the periorbital tissue and conjunctivae, and warm, velvety skin further supports this diagnosis. The symptoms and signs are highly suggestive of Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that can cause hyperthyroidism and orbital involvement.\\n\\nGraves' disease is known to cause orbital involvement, including exophthalmos and eyelid retraction, due to the deposition of mucopolysaccharides in the orbital tissues. The MRI of the head and orbits in such cases would most likely reveal the following findings:\\n\\nThe correct answer is B. diffuse enlargement of the rectus muscles. This is because Graves' disease can cause the rectus muscles to become inflamed and enlarged, leading to the characteristic exophthalmos and bulging of the eyes. The other options are not directly related to the orbital involvement seen in Graves' disease.\\n\\nIn calcification of the orbit (A), this would be more suggestive of a different condition, such as orbital myositis or a traumatic injury. Dilated ventricles (C) would be more indicative of hydrocephalus or other neurological conditions, and lymphoma (D) would be a rare and unusual cause of orbital symptoms in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
