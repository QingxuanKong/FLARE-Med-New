    "question": "In an experiment, the first cleavage plane of an amphibian zygote was manipulated so that the gray crescent was contained in only one of the two blastomeres that result from the first cleavage. The two blastomeres were then separated. What is the expected fate of the blastomeres?",
    "options": {
        "A": "The blastomere with the gray crescent will grow in size more quickly than the one without the gray crescent.",
        "B": "The blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.",
        "C": "The blastomere without the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.",
        "D": "The blastomere with the gray crescent will stop dividing and die before the second cleavage."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the significance of the gray crescent in an amphibian zygote. The gray crescent is a region of the zygote where the blastoderm, which will eventually form the ectoderm and endoderm, is located. In a normal zygote, the gray crescent is split between the two blastomeres resulting from the first cleavage. If the gray crescent is isolated in only one blastomere, it will lead to an imbalance in the development of the embryo. The blastomere with the gray crescent will have a larger amount of ectoderm and endoderm-forming cells, which will contribute to the formation of a more complex and larger embryo. On the other hand, the blastomere without the gray crescent will have a smaller amount of ectoderm and endoderm-forming cells, leading to a less complex and smaller embryo. Therefore, the blastomere with the gray crescent will grow in size more quickly than the one without the gray crescent.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
