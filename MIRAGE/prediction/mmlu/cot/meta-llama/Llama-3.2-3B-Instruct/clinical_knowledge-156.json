    "options": {
        "A": "A pulsatile mass is always due to an aortic aneurysm",
        "B": "An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion",
        "C": "A large mass arising out of the pelvis which disappears following urethral catheterization is caused by an ovarian cyst",
        "D": "An indentible mass is caused by faecal loading of the colon"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze each option and evaluate its accuracy in relation to abdominal masses.\\n\\nOption A: A pulsatile mass is always due to an aortic aneurysm. This statement is not entirely true. A pulsatile mass can be due to various causes, such as aortic aneurysm, but it can also be caused by other conditions like a pulsating abdominal aortic aneurysm or a pulsatile mass in the inferior vena cava.\\n\\nOption B: An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion. This statement is true. An enlarged kidney is typically dull to percussion due to the increased density of the kidney tissue.\\n\\nOption C: A large mass arising out of the pelvis which disappears following urethral catheterization is caused by an ovarian cyst. This statement is false. A large mass in the pelvis that disappears following urethral catheterization is more likely to be a rectal mass, not an ovarian cyst. The pressure from the catheter can displace a rectal mass.\\n\\nOption D: An indentible mass is caused by faecal loading of the colon. This statement is false. An indentible mass is more likely to be caused by a mass in the rectum or sigmoid colon, but it is not solely caused by faecal loading of the colon.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is B. An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
