    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Addison\\u2019s disease is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by the inadequate production of several hormones by the adrenal glands. The primary hormone deficiency is cortisol and, to a lesser extent, aldosterone. Prolactin is not directly related to Addison\\u2019s disease. Addison\\u2019s disease is not typically associated with generalized pigmentation. Hypertension is not a characteristic of Addison\\u2019s disease; in fact, it is often accompanied by hypotension due to the lack of aldosterone. Diabetes is a complication of Addison\\u2019s disease due to the deficiency of cortisol, which is necessary for glucose metabolism. Therefore, considering the options provided, the correct answer is D. Diabetes is a complication of Addison\\u2019s disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
