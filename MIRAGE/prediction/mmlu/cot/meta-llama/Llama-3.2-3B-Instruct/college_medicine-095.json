    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down the composition of triacylglycerides (also known as triglycerides). A triacylglyceride is a type of lipid that consists of a glycerol backbone, which is a three-carbon molecule with hydroxyl groups at each end. The glycerol backbone is indeed II, as stated in option B. However, the correct composition of triacyglycerides is that they consist of a glycerol backbone, three fatty acid chains attached to the hydroxyl groups of the glycerol backbone via ester linkages, not phosphodiester linkages. Phosphodiester linkages are found in phospholipids, not triacylglycerides. Therefore, option III is incorrect. Triacylglycerides consist of a glycerol backbone and three ester linkages, which attach the fatty acid chains to the glycerol backbone, making option D the correct answer. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
