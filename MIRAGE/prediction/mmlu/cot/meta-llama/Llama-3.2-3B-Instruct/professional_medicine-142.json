    "question": "A 35-year-old female develops nausea and vomiting after she underwent a cholecystectomy for protracted ileus. Her body mass index was 23\u00a0kg/m2\u00a0before surgery, and, except for the cholecystitis, she was in good health. The patient remains unable to eat 6\u00a0days after surgery. Which of the following forms of nutritional support is most appropriate for this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "central hyperalimentation",
        "B": "feeding through a nasogastric feeding tube",
        "C": "oral fat-free modular diet",
        "D": "peripheral hyperalimentation"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate form of nutritional support for this patient, let's analyze the given information step by step. 1. The patient is unable to eat 6 days after surgery, which indicates a significant delay in oral intake. This suggests that the patient may require nutritional support to prevent malnutrition and support healing. 2. The patient underwent a cholecystectomy, which is a major abdominal surgery. This type of surgery can lead to postoperative ileus, a condition where the intestines do not function normally, causing nausea and vomiting. In this case, the patient is already experiencing these symptoms. 3. The patient's body mass index (BMI) is 23 kg/m^2, which falls within the normal range. This suggests that the patient does not have any significant malnutrition-related issues. 4. Considering the patient's inability to eat and the presence of postoperative ileus, we need to choose a form of nutritional support that can bypass the gastrointestinal tract. Now, let's evaluate the options: - Option A, central hyperalimentation, involves the delivery of nutrients directly into the bloodstream through a central line. This method bypasses the gastrointestinal tract and can be effective in patients with severe gastrointestinal dysfunction or those who are unable to eat. - Option B, feeding through a nasogastric tube, involves delivering nutrients directly into the stomach through a tube inserted through the nose. While this method can be used in some cases, it may not be the best option for patients with severe postoperative ileus, as it may not be tolerated well. - Option C, an oral fat-free modular diet, is a type of enteral nutrition that can be used in patients who are unable to eat orally. However, the patient has been unable to eat for 6 days, making this option less suitable. - Option D, peripheral hyperalimentation, is not a commonly used term in clinical practice. It may be a distractor. Based on the analysis, the most appropriate form of nutritional support for this patient is central hyperalimentation, as it bypasses the gastrointestinal tract and can provide necessary nutrients directly into the bloodstream. answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
