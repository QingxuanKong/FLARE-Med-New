    "question": "A 7-month-old infant, who was recently discharged from the hospital following an episode of enteritis and dehydration, has persistent watery diarrhea. His mother feeds him cow-milk formula and a variety of strained fruits and vegetables. On physical examination, his temperature is 37.4\u00b0C (99.3\u00b0F), his mucous membranes are dry, and his abdomen is slightly distended. No other abnormalities are seen. The problem is most likely related to which of the following?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Fructose intolerance",
        "B": "Transient lactase deficiency",
        "C": "Magnesium deficiency",
        "D": "Regional enteritis"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient is a 7-month-old infant with a recent episode of enteritis and dehydration, which suggests an underlying gastrointestinal issue. The infant has persistent watery diarrhea, which is a key symptom that needs to be addressed. The infant is being fed cow-milk formula and a variety of strained fruits and vegetables, which are common allergens or intolerances that could cause symptoms like diarrhea. The physical examination shows a normal temperature, dry mucous membranes, and a slightly distended abdomen, indicating that the infant is not severely ill at the moment. Considering the age of the infant and the recent history of enteritis, it is essential to think about conditions that could cause persistent diarrhea in a previously healthy infant. Fructose intolerance is a common cause of diarrhea in infants, especially those with a history of enteritis. Transient lactase deficiency is unlikely to cause persistent diarrhea, as it is a temporary condition that typically resolves on its own within a few weeks. Magnesium deficiency is not directly related to the symptoms described, and regional enteritis is less likely in this context, as it is a condition more commonly seen in older children and adults. Given the patient's age, medical history, and symptoms, the most likely cause of the persistent watery diarrhea is a fructose intolerance. This condition is consistent with the infant's symptoms and is a common cause of diarrhea in infants with a history of enteritis and a diet that includes cow-milk formula and fruits and vegetables.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
