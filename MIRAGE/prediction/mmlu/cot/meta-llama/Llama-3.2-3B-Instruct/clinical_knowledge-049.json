    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine how most free fatty acids are transported in the blood, let's consider the properties of free fatty acids and the role of various transport mechanisms in the body. Free fatty acids are hydrophobic molecules that do not easily dissolve in water. This makes it difficult for them to be transported directly in the aqueous environment of the bloodstream. Option A, \"inside the red blood cells,\" is incorrect because red blood cells primarily carry oxygen and carbon dioxide, not free fatty acids. Option C, \"combined with glucose,\" is also incorrect because free fatty acids and glucose are different types of nutrients with distinct metabolic pathways. Option B, \"as lipoproteins,\" is partially correct in that some free fatty acids can be transported bound to lipoproteins, but this is not the primary mechanism for most free fatty acids. The primary mechanism for transporting free fatty acids in the blood is through binding to albumin, a protein in the plasma. Albumin has a high affinity for fatty acids, allowing it to bind and transport them in the bloodstream. This is the correct answer. Therefore, the correct answer is D. bound to albumin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
