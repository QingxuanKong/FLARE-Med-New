    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step.\\n\\nOption A: 'tend to reduce diversity by eliminating food resources for other species' - This statement is not accurate. Keystone species actually tend to increase diversity by providing resources for other species, rather than eliminating them. For example, pollinators like bees and butterflies are essential for plant reproduction, and their loss can lead to reduced plant diversity.\\n\\nOption B: 'provide the foundation for food webs' - This statement is accurate. Keystone species play a crucial role in maintaining the structure and composition of ecological communities by providing a foundation for food webs. They can be both predators and prey, and their loss can have cascading effects on the entire ecosystem.\\n\\nOption C: 'are more abundant than most other species in their communities' - This statement is not accurate. Keystone species are not necessarily more abundant than other species in their communities. They may be relatively rare or even scarce, but their impact on the ecosystem can be disproportionate to their abundance.\\n\\nOption D: 'can prevent superior competitors from driving inferior competitors to local extinction' - This statement is not accurate. Keystone species do not prevent other species from driving each other to extinction. Instead, they can provide resources and habitat for other species, allowing them to coexist and potentially thrive.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. provide the foundation for food webs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
