    "question": "A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of increased facial hair growth. Her last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased. Serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges. Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. Which of the following best describes this mass?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Granulosa tumor",
        "B": "Ovarian carcinoid",
        "C": "Sertoli-Leydig tumor",
        "D": "Teratoma"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key information provided: 1. The patient is a 40-year-old woman presenting with increased facial hair growth, temporal balding, and clitoral enlargement, which are all indicative of hyperandrogenism. 2. The serum testosterone concentration is increased, further supporting the diagnosis of hyperandrogenism. 3. The pelvic examination reveals a 12-cm ovarian mass. 4. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results point towards a diagnosis of a sex cord-stromal tumor. Considering these points, we need to determine the type of ovarian mass. Let's evaluate the options: A. Granulosa tumor: These tumors are sex cord-stromal tumors that can produce estrogen, but they are less likely to produce androgens. This makes it less likely that this is the correct answer. B. Ovarian carcinoid: These tumors are neuroendocrine tumors that can produce a variety of hormones, including serotonin and other amines. They are not typically associated with hyperandrogenism. C. Sertoli-Leydig tumor: These tumors are sex cord-stromal tumors that can produce androgens, leading to virilization symptoms such as facial hair growth, clitoral enlargement, and increased serum testosterone levels. This option is consistent with the patient's presentation. D. Teratoma: These tumors are germ cell tumors that can contain various types of tissues, including hair, muscle, and bone. They are not typically associated with hyperandrogenism. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is a Sertoli-Leydig tumor, which is a type of sex cord-stromal tumor that produces androgens.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
