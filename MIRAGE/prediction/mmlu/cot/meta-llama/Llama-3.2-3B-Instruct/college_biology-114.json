    "options": {
        "A": "A different polypeptide is produced.",
        "B": "The polarity of tRNA becomes the opposite of that of DNA.",

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the process of how mutations in DNA can result in the expression of a new phenotype. 1. **Understanding DNA structure and function**: DNA is a double-stranded helix where the sequence of nucleotides determines the genetic information. This information is used to synthesize proteins, which perform various functions in the cell. 2. **The process of gene expression**: Gene expression involves several steps, including transcription (converting DNA into mRNA) and translation (converting mRNA into a polypeptide). 3. **Effect of mutations on gene expression**: Mutations in DNA can occur due to various factors such as errors during DNA replication, environmental factors, or genetic mutations. These mutations can alter the DNA sequence, leading to changes in the genetic information. 4. **How mutations affect protein synthesis**: When a mutation occurs in a gene, it can result in a change in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide produced during translation. This change in the amino acid sequence can lead to a new polypeptide with different properties and functions. 5. **Analyzing the options**: - A. A different polypeptide is produced: This option directly relates to the effect of mutations on protein synthesis, which is a crucial step in gene expression. Mutations can lead to changes in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide, resulting in a new protein with different properties. - B. The polarity of tRNA becomes the opposite of that of DNA: This option is not directly related to the expression of a new phenotype. The polarity of tRNA is related to its function in translation, but it does not directly explain how mutations in DNA result in a new phenotype. - C. Nucleic acids are methylated: Methylation of nucleic acids can affect gene expression, but it is not the primary mechanism by which mutations result in a new phenotype. - D. The gene is now read in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction: This option is incorrect because the direction of transcription and translation is determined by the DNA sequence and is not directly affected by mutations. **Conclusion**: The correct answer is A. A different polypeptide is produced, as it directly explains how mutations in DNA can result in the expression of a new phenotype by altering the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide. ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mutations in DNA can result in the expression of a new phenotype by altering the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide produced during translation.
