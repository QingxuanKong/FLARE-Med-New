    "question": "A previously healthy 17-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion. She plays field hockey and has noticed she coughs when running up and down the field. The cough is nonproductive and resolves with rest. She has not had chest pain or palpitations. She takes no medications and does not smoke. Her sister has asthma. The patient appears well. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 99%. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. Spirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 90% and an FEV1 of 90% of predicted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Asthma",
        "B": "Chronic bronchitis",
        "C": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease",
        "D": "Postnasal drip syndrome"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's history and physical examination: 1. The patient is a previously healthy 17-year-old girl who experiences exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion, which is relieved by rest. This suggests a condition that is exacerbated by physical exertion. 2. The patient does not have any symptoms of chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath at rest, which makes conditions like angina or arrhythmias less likely. 3. The patient does not smoke and has no family history of asthma, but her sister has asthma. This makes asthma a possible consideration, but it is not the only possibility. 4. The spirometry results show a normal FEV1:FVC ratio and an FEV1 of 90% of predicted, which indicates that the patient does not have obstructive lung disease (e.g., asthma or chronic bronchitis). 5. The chest x-ray and physical examination are normal, which further supports the absence of obstructive lung disease. Considering these points, the patient's symptoms are more suggestive of a non-obstructive condition that is exacerbated by physical exertion. Postnasal drip syndrome is a common condition that involves the sensation of mucus running down the back of the throat, which can be triggered by exercise or other factors. It can cause cough and nasal congestion without any underlying lung disease. Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is postnasal drip syndrome, which is characterized by exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion without any evidence of obstructive lung disease.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
