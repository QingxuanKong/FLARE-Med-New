        "B": "is prevented from everting by papillary muscles.",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to identify the function and location of the atrioventricular (AV) valves in the heart. The AV valves are located between the atria and ventricles, and their primary function is to allow blood to flow from the atria into the ventricles while preventing backflow. There are two AV valves: the tricuspid valve between the right atrium and right ventricle, and the mitral valve between the left atrium and left ventricle.\\n\\nGiven the options provided, we can analyze each choice as follows:\\n\\nOption A: A semilunar valve is a type of valve found in the heart that allows blood to flow from the ventricles to the aorta and pulmonary artery during systole. This is the opposite of what we're looking for, as the AV valves allow blood to flow from the atria to the ventricles, not from the ventricles to the aorta or pulmonary artery.\\n\\nOption B: The papillary muscles are actually found in the ventricles, and their primary function is to control the opening and closing of the semilunar valves, not the AV valves. So, this option is incorrect.\\n\\nOption C: The AV valves are closed during systole, allowing blood to flow from the atria into the ventricles. During diastole, they open to allow blood to flow from the ventricles back into the atria. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\\n\\nOption D: The tricuspid valve prevents blood from returning from the right ventricle to the right atrium as the heart relaxes, and the mitral valve prevents blood from returning from the left ventricle to the left atrium. Since the question asks about the right atrioventricular valve, this is the correct answer.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
