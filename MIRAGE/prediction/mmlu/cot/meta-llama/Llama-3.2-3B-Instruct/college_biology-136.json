    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking: To solve this problem, let's break it down: 1. **Understanding the Phenotypes**: The question describes a female fruit fly with a gray body and normal wings, and a male fruit fly with a black body and vestigial wings. We need to determine why the offspring would have a gray body and vestigial wings. 2. **Genetics Basics**: - **Linked Genes**: Genes that are located close to each other on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together, as they are passed down in the same package during reproduction. - **Vestigial Wings**: Vestigial wings are a result of a genetic mutation that reduces the size or functionality of the wings, but does not eliminate them entirely. 3. **Analyzing the Phenotypes**: - The female has a gray body and normal wings, which suggests that she is heterozygous for the genes controlling body color (let's say \"B\" for black and \"b\" for gray) and wing size (let's say \"V\" for normal and \"v\" for vestigial). - The male has a black body and vestigial wings, suggesting he is homozygous recessive for both genes (bbvv). 4. **Considering the Options**: - **A. Crossing Over**: Crossing over occurs during meiosis, where segments of DNA are swapped between homologous chromosomes. This can introduce new combinations of alleles, but it doesn't directly explain the presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged offspring. - **B. Independent Assortment**: Independent assortment occurs during meiosis, where alleles are sorted randomly onto different chromosomes. This would not directly explain the presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged offspring, as the alleles for body color and wing size are not on different chromosomes. - **C. Segregation of Alleles**: Segregation of alleles occurs during meiosis, where each gamete receives a different combination of alleles. Since the female is heterozygous for both genes, her offspring will inherit different combinations of alleles. If the male's vestigial wings are caused by a recessive allele (v), the offspring can inherit a combination of bb and vv, resulting in gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies. - **D. Penetrance**: Penetrance refers to the likelihood that an individual expresses a particular phenotype given that they have the genotype. This concept doesn't directly explain the presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged offspring. **Conclusion**: The presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny is best explained by the segregation of alleles, as the female's heterozygous genotype allows for the combination of alleles to be passed on to the offspring, resulting in the observed phenotype. **Output**: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny is best explained by the segregation of alleles, as the female's heterozygous genotype allows for the combination of alleles to be passed on to the offspring, resulting in the observed phenotype.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ```",
