    "options": {
        "A": "Left lateral pterygoid muscle",
        "B": "Right lateral pterygoid muscle",
        "C": "Left medial pterygoid muscle",
        "D": "Right medial pterygoid muscle"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most active muscle during a right lateral excursion of the mandible, we need to understand the function of the muscles involved in mandibular movement. The lateral pterygoid muscles are the primary muscles responsible for the protrusion and lateral movement of the mandible. The left and right lateral pterygoid muscles work together to move the mandible to the right and left, respectively. However, during a right lateral excursion, we are looking for the muscle that is most active on the right side. The medial pterygoid muscles, on the other hand, are primarily involved in the elevation and depression of the mandible, rather than lateral movement. Therefore, the muscle most active during a right lateral excursion of the mandible is the right lateral pterygoid muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
