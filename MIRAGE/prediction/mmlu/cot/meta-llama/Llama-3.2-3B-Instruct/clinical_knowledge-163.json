    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. Option A: 'are always harmful'. This statement is not entirely accurate. While many mutations can lead to harmful effects, some mutations can be beneficial or neutral. For example, beneficial mutations can occur in populations that allow for adaptation to changing environments. Therefore, option A is incorrect. 2. Option B: 'only occur in the presence of carcinogens'. This statement is also not entirely accurate. Mutations can occur spontaneously due to errors during DNA replication, without the presence of carcinogens. This process is known as spontaneous mutations. Therefore, option B is incorrect. 3. Option C: 'increase tumour growth'. This statement is not universally true. While some mutations can lead to cancer, others can actually prevent tumour growth or have no effect on tumour growth. The impact of a mutation on tumour growth depends on various factors, including the type of mutation and the specific cell type. Therefore, option C is incorrect. 4. Option D: 'occur spontaneously at a low rate'. This statement is accurate. Spontaneous mutations occur when there is an error during DNA replication, and they are estimated to occur at a low rate. These mutations can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful, depending on the context. Therefore, option D is correct. The final answer is: {\"answer_choice\": \"D\"}\", \"confidence\": \"High\"}}",
