    "question": "A 63-year-old woman comes to the physician 1 day after the sudden onset of pain and swelling of her right knee. She has had no injury. Her medications include occasional ibuprofen for mild osteoarthritis of both knees. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 129/79 mm Hg. Examination of the right knee shows warmth, erythema, and effusion. Exquisite tenderness is produced with minimal range-of-motion testing. Examination of synovial fluid obtained via joint aspiration shows that it is clear, with positively birefringent rhomboids observed under polarized light microscopy. Deposition of which of the following substances is the most likely cause of these findings?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Ammonium urate",
        "B": "Calcium oxalate",
        "C": "Calcium pyrophosphate",
        "D": "Calcium urate"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the given clinical presentation and laboratory findings. The patient presents with sudden onset of pain and swelling of the right knee, which is consistent with acute arthritis. The presence of warmth, erythema, and effusion further supports this diagnosis. The patient's history of mild osteoarthritis and the absence of trauma also point towards an inflammatory or degenerative cause of the arthritis. The key laboratory finding is the presence of positively birefringent rhomboids observed under polarized light microscopy in the synovial fluid. This is a characteristic feature of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD), also known as pseudogout. CPPD is a type of crystal-induced arthritis that is often associated with hyperparathyroidism, chronic kidney disease, or other metabolic disorders. The positively birefringent crystals seen in the synovial fluid are calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals. Considering the patient's age, the sudden onset of symptoms, and the laboratory findings, the most likely cause of the deposition of the substance in the patient's joints is calcium pyrophosphate.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
