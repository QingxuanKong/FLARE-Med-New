    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the cell cycle and identify the phases common to both meiosis and mitosis. The cell cycle consists of three main phases: G1, S, and G2. - **G1 phase**: This is the gap 1 phase, where the cell grows and prepares for DNA replication. This phase is not unique to meiosis or mitosis; both meiotic and mitotic cells go through this phase. - **S phase (Synthesis phase)**: During this phase, DNA replication occurs, resulting in two daughter cells with the same amount of DNA as the parent cell. This phase is also common to both meiosis and mitosis. - **G2 phase**: This is the gap 2 phase, where the cell prepares for cell division. Like the G1 phase, it is not unique to meiosis or mitosis. Meiosis, however, consists of two successive nuclear divisions (meiosis I and meiosis II), each with its own set of phases similar to the mitotic cell cycle. Meiosis I is similar to the G1 and G2 phases of mitosis, with a prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, and telophase I, followed by cytokinesis. Meiosis II is similar to the S and G2 phases of mitosis, with a prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II. Given this information, the phases common to both meiosis and mitosis are G1 and G2, as well as S phase. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Meiosis and mitosis both have G1 and G2 phases, as well as S phase. This is because both phases are part of the broader cell cycle, which is common to both meiotic and mitotic cells. Meiosis has its own unique phases, but the G1, S, and G2 phases are shared with mitosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
