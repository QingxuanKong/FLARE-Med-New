    "question": "Why should careful consideration be given to providing people aged over 65 with information sources that are internet based?",
    "options": {
        "A": "They may have difficulty reading the screen.",
        "B": "Less than 30% of people over 65 years have access to the internet.",
        "C": "The internet is aimed at younger people.",
        "D": "They may not be able to type."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's consider the potential challenges and advantages of providing internet-based information sources for people aged over 65. Option A suggests that they may have difficulty reading the screen, which is a valid concern, but it's not the primary reason. Option C implies that the internet is primarily aimed at younger people, which is not accurate. Option D mentions that they may not be able to type, which is also a valid concern but not the main reason. Option B states that less than 30% of people over 65 years have access to the internet, which is incorrect according to recent statistics. In reality, the percentage of people over 65 with internet access is actually increasing. Considering these points, the main reason to provide careful consideration is that people over 65 may face difficulties with certain digital technologies, but the key issue is not the percentage of internet access, but rather the specific challenges they may encounter when using digital information sources. Therefore, the correct answer is not explicitly listed, but the underlying theme is that people over 65 may face difficulties with digital literacy and navigation, which is not directly addressed by the options. However, based on the given options, the closest answer would be A, as it highlights a common challenge that may affect people over 65 when using digital information sources.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
