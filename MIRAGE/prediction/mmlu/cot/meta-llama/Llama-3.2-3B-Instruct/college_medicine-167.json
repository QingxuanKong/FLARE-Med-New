    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the sex of a child, we need to understand the role of the X and Y chromosomes in sex determination. In humans, sex is determined by the presence of X and Y chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). The Y chromosome carries the SRY gene, which triggers the development of testes in males. The presence of the Y chromosome is what determines male sex. The number of X chromosomes from the mother does not determine sex, as females can have two X chromosomes. The recessive allele on the X chromosome does not play a role in sex determination. Therefore, the correct answer is related to the presence of the Y chromosome, but it cannot be a single Y chromosome from the mother, as the father is the one who contributes the Y chromosome. The correct answer is a single Y chromosome from the father.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
