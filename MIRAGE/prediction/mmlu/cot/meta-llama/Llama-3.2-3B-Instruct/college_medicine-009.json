Synthetic steroids are man-made versions of natural hormones that are used to promote muscle growth and development. The most well-known and widely used synthetic steroid is testosterone, which is a naturally occurring hormone in the human body. Testosterone is a key hormone responsible for male reproductive and sexual health, as well as muscle mass and bone density. Synthetic testosterone is commonly used in the treatment of hypogonadism, a condition where the testes do not produce enough testosterone. It is also used by athletes and bodybuilders to enhance muscle mass and performance. \", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
