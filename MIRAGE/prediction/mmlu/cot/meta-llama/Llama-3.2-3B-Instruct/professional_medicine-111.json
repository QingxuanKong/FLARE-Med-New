    "question": "A 40-year-old female secretary comes to the office because of a 2-month history of fatigue, and generalized aching and weakness of the proximal muscles of all four extremities. The patient initially noticed the weakness only while she was getting in and out of her car, but during the past 2 weeks, the weakness has progressed, so that she now has difficulty combing her hair. Since the symptoms began, she also has had aching of the joints in her hands that has responded partially to ibuprofen. She was adopted and family history is unknown. She has two teenaged children who are well. She appears uncomfortable. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 68 kg(150 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 37.7\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. The patient is alert and fully oriented. Physical examination discloses cracking of the skin of both hands that involves the tips and lateral sides of several fingers. The muscles of the upper arms and legs are somewhat tender to pressure. Results of serum laboratory studies show a creatine kinase concentration of 600 U/L and a lactate dehydrogenase concentration of 800 U/L. Results of complete blood count are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Fibromyalgia",
        "B": "Myasthenia gravis",
        "C": "Polymyositis",
        "D": "Scleroderma"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the key points from the patient's history and physical examination: 1. The patient is a 40-year-old female with a 2-month history of fatigue, generalized aching, and weakness of the proximal muscles of all four extremities. The weakness has progressed over time, affecting daily activities such as getting in and out of her car and combing her hair. 2. The patient reports aching of the joints in her hands that has responded partially to ibuprofen. This suggests an inflammatory component to her condition. 3. Physical examination reveals cracking of the skin of both hands, involving the tips and lateral sides of several fingers, which is indicative of myositis. 4. The muscles of the upper arms and legs are somewhat tender to pressure, further supporting the presence of muscle inflammation. 5. Laboratory results show elevated serum creatine kinase (600 U/L) and lactate dehydrogenase (800 U/L), indicating muscle damage. 6. The patient is otherwise healthy, with no significant medical history and no family history of similar conditions. Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is polymyositis, a type of inflammatory muscle disease that primarily affects the proximal muscles, leading to muscle weakness and inflammation. Fibromyalgia is less likely as it is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, but not typically muscle weakness or elevated inflammatory markers. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that affects the nerve-muscle connection, leading to muscle weakness, but it is not typically associated with skin cracking or elevated inflammatory markers. Scleroderma is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin and connective tissue, but it is not primarily characterized by muscle weakness or elevated inflammatory markers. Answer choice: C. Polymyositis\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",
