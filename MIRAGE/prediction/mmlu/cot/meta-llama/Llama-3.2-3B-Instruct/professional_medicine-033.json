    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up of sarcoidosis. His only new complaint is pain in his legs that increases with weight-bearing. He has been taking glucocorticoid therapy for the past 6 months. Vital signs now are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 78/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. The patient is thin and is in no acute distress. Auscultation of the chest discloses scattered bilateral basilar crackles. There is mild left hip pain present with both active and passive range of motion. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact. Neurologic examination is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Avascular necrosis of the femoral head",
        "B": "Herniated nucleus pulposus",
        "C": "Narrowing of the hip joint",
        "D": "Osteoporosis"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's consider the patient's symptoms and history. The patient has sarcoidosis, which is a systemic granulomatous disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the lungs, skin, and joints. The patient has been taking glucocorticoid therapy for the past 6 months, which can have several side effects, including osteoporosis and avascular necrosis of the bone. The patient presents with pain in the legs that increases with weight-bearing, which is a classic symptom of avascular necrosis of the femoral head. The patient's thin body mass index (BMI) also increases the risk of osteoporosis. However, the presence of bilateral basilar crackles on chest auscultation suggests pulmonary involvement, which is more commonly associated with sarcoidosis. The patient's neurologic examination is normal, which makes a herniated nucleus pulposus less likely. Narrowing of the hip joint is not a typical presentation of sarcoidosis or glucocorticoid therapy. Given the patient's history of sarcoidosis and glucocorticoid therapy, avascular necrosis of the femoral head is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
