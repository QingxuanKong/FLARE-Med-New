    "predict": "To determine the frequency of heterozygotes under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we need to use the Hardy-Weinberg principle. This principle states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences. Given: - Frequency of allele A = 0.6 - Frequency of allele B = 0.4 Since the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium assumes that the alleles are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we can calculate the frequency of heterozygotes using the formula: Frequency of heterozygotes = (Frequency of allele A) * (Frequency of allele B) / 2 This is because each heterozygote has two alleles, one of each type. Frequency of heterozygotes = 0.6 * 0.4 / 2 Frequency of heterozygotes = 0.24 / 2 Frequency of heterozygotes = 0.12 However, this is not among the answer choices. We can see that my initial approach was incorrect. Let's recalculate. The correct approach is to calculate the frequency of homozygotes first. Frequency of homozygote AA = (Frequency of allele A)^2 = 0.6^2 = 0.36 Frequency of homozygote BB = (Frequency of allele B)^2 = 0.4^2 = 0.16 Frequency of homozygote BB = (Frequency of allele B)^2 = 0.4^2 = 0.16 The frequency of heterozygotes can be found by subtracting the sum of the frequencies of homozygotes from 1. Frequency of heterozygotes = 1 - (Frequency of homozygote AA + Frequency of homozygote BB) Frequency of heterozygotes = 1 - (0.36 + 0.16) Frequency of heterozygotes = 1 - 0.52 Frequency of heterozygotes = 0.48 Therefore, the frequency of heterozygotes under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is 0.48. Here is the output in the requested format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the frequency of heterozygotes, first calculate the frequency of homozygotes.
