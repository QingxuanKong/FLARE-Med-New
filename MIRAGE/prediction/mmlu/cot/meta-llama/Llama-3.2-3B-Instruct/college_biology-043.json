    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to consider the structures involved in gas exchange in a woody stem. Gas exchange is the process by which plants exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with the atmosphere. In a woody stem, gas exchange occurs primarily through the bark, but there are specific structures that facilitate this process. Let's evaluate each option: A. Lenticels: Lenticels are small, raised openings on the bark of woody stems that allow for gas exchange. They are essentially small pores that provide a pathway for oxygen and carbon dioxide to pass in and out of the plant. B. Terminal buds: Terminal buds are the growing tips of woody stems, responsible for producing new growth. While they do play a role in the overall growth and development of the plant, they are not directly involved in gas exchange. C. Nodes: Nodes are the joints where leaves, branches, or roots meet the stem. They are crucial for the transport of nutrients and water but are not directly involved in gas exchange. D. Internodes: Internodes are the segments of a stem between nodes, responsible for the growth and elongation of the stem. Like nodes, they are not directly involved in gas exchange. Considering the functions of each structure, lenticels are the primary sites of gas exchange in a woody stem.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
