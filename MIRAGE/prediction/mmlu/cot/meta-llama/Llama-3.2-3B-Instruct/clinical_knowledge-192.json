    "question": "Which products of ADP degradation increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Ammonia, hypoxanthine and uric acid.",
        "B": "Ammonia, urea and uric acid.",
        "C": "Ammonia, urea and creatinine.",
        "D": "Ammonia, urea and creatine."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Understanding the context**: The question is about the products of ADP (adenosine diphosphate) degradation that increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports. 2. **ADP degradation**: When muscles undergo anaerobic metabolism (without oxygen), ADP is broken down to produce energy. This process involves the conversion of ADP to ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through glycolysis and the subsequent breakdown of ATP to ADP. 3. **Products of ADP degradation**: The primary products of ADP degradation during anaerobic metabolism are: - **Urea**: A waste product that is produced when the liver converts ammonia to urea for excretion. - **Lactic acid**: A byproduct of anaerobic glycolysis, which is not listed as an option, but it's closely related to the correct answer. - **Creatinine**: A waste product of muscle metabolism, primarily produced from creatine breakdown. 4. **Ammonia production**: Ammonia is indeed produced during muscle metabolism, particularly during high-intensity, short-duration activities like sprint sports. However, its primary fate is conversion to urea by the liver, not directly increasing its concentration in the blood. 5. **Eliminating incorrect options**: - **Option B (Ammonia, urea and uric acid)**: Uric acid is a product of purine metabolism, not directly related to ADP degradation. - **Option D (Ammonia, urea and creatine)**: Creatine is a product of phosphocreatine breakdown, but its concentration in the blood is not directly related to ADP degradation. Considering these steps, the correct answer is related to the products of ADP degradation and the consequences of anaerobic metabolism during sprint sports. Therefore: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The correct answer is related to the products of ADP degradation during anaerobic metabolism in muscles, which include ammonia, urea, and creatinine. Ammonia is converted to urea in the liver, and creatinine is a waste product of muscle metabolism. The correct answer is C, as it includes ammonia (which is converted to urea), urea, and creatinine, all of which are related to ADP degradation during anaerobic metabolism in muscles during sprint sports.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
