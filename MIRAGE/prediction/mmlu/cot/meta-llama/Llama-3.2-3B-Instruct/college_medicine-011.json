    "question": "A descript amount of 2-bromobutane is placed into a strong solution of ethanol and allowed to complete a reaction. The result of this reaction produces a major product of 2-butene and a minor product of 1-butene. Which of the following descriptions of the starting compound explains why 2-butene is the major product?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Carbon 3 has less hydrogen atoms",
        "B": "1-butene rearranges to 2-butene in solution",
        "C": "Ethanol prefers the second carbon in any chain",
        "D": "Cyclic aromatization"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Understanding the reaction**: The reaction involves 2-bromobutane reacting with ethanol in a strong solution, resulting in 2-butene as the major product and 1-butene as the minor product. 2. **Analyzing the options**: - Option A: This option suggests that 2-butene is the major product because carbon 3 has less hydrogen atoms. However, the number of hydrogen atoms on carbon 3 does not directly influence the major product in this reaction. 3. **Understanding the reaction mechanism**: The reaction is likely an elimination reaction, where a hydrogen atom is removed from the carbon atom bonded to the bromine atom, resulting in the formation of an alkene (2-butene or 1-butene). This type of reaction is facilitated by the strong base in the ethanol solution. 4. **Analyzing the options**: - Option B: This option suggests that 1-butene rearranges to 2-butene in solution. However, there is no indication that rearrangement occurs in this reaction. - Option C: This option suggests that ethanol prefers the second carbon in any chain. This is a plausible explanation, as alcohols are known to act as nucleophiles in substitution reactions, and in this case, the ethanol molecule can act as a nucleophile to attack the carbon atom bonded to the bromine atom. This would lead to the formation of 2-butene as the major product, as it is the more stable alkene. - Option D: Cyclic aromatization is not relevant to this reaction, as there is no indication of an aromatic system in the reactants or products. 5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible explanation for why 2-butene is the major product is that ethanol acts as a nucleophile and prefers the second carbon in the chain, leading to the formation of 2-butene.
