    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. An impulse is a series of electrical and chemical signals that travels through a neuron. 2. The impulse starts at the neuron's cell body, where it is generated. 3. From the cell body, the impulse travels down the length of the neuron, passing through the axon. 4. The axon has two main parts: the axon hillock (where the impulse is generated) and the axon terminals (where the impulse is transmitted to other neurons or to muscles or glands). 5. The point where the impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another is where the axon terminals meet the dendrites of the next neuron. Considering the options: - A. Dendrite: The dendrites are the branching extensions of a neuron that receive signals from other neurons. They are not the point where the impulse is transmitted to another neuron. - B. Glial cell: Glial cells provide support and maintenance functions for neurons, but they are not directly involved in transmitting impulses between neurons. - C. Nerve center: This term is not a standard term in neuroscience, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer. - D. Synapse: The synapse is the gap between the axon terminals of one neuron and the dendrites of another neuron, where chemical signals are transmitted. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Synapse.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
