    "question": "A 17-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because she has not had a menstrual period for 6 months. The patient is unconcerned about the lack of menses. Menarche occurred at the age of 12 years, and menses had occurred at regular 28-day intervals until they became irregular 1 year ago. She is a member of her high school gymnastics team. She appears emaciated. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 40 kg (88 lb); BMI is 15 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 54/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's amenorrhea?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Hyperthyroidism",
        "B": "Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism",
        "C": "Hypothyroidism",
        "D": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To determine the most likely cause of this patient's amenorrhea, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. **Age and Menstrual History**: The patient is 17 years old, which is still within the age range when menstrual irregularities can occur due to various reasons. She had regular menses until they became irregular 1 year ago. This suggests a recent change in her menstrual cycle. 2. **Physical Appearance and Weight**: The patient appears emaciated, is underweight (BMI of 15 kg/m2), and is a member of a high school gymnastics team. This suggests she may be engaging in excessive physical activity, which can lead to amenorrhea due to the physical demands of her sport. 3. **Vital Signs**: Her pulse is low (54/min) and blood pressure is low (80/50 mm Hg), indicating bradycardia and hypotension. These findings are consistent with anorexia nervosa or another severe eating disorder. 4. **Considering the Options**: - **A. Hyperthyroidism**: Typically presents with weight loss, tachycardia, and other symptoms not mentioned in this case. - **B. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism**: This condition is characterized by low estrogen and testosterone levels, leading to amenorrhea, but it's less likely in this case given the recent onset of amenorrhea and the patient's physical condition. - **C. Hypothyroidism**: Can cause amenorrhea but is less likely given the patient's physical appearance and the context of her athletic activity. - **D. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)**: Typically presents with hyperandrogenism, irregular menses, and obesity, which does not fit this patient's profile. Given the patient's recent onset of amenorrhea, her physical appearance, and her participation in a high-physical-activity sport, the most likely cause of her amenorrhea is an eating disorder, specifically anorexia nervosa or another form of severe eating disorder. The patient's low BMI and physical condition are indicative of this. Therefore, the answer is: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's recent onset of amenorrhea, her physical appearance, and her participation in a high-physical-activity sport, the most likely cause of her amenorrhea is an eating disorder, specifically anorexia nervosa or another form of severe eating disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" } ```",
