Genes are made up of different regions that play specific roles in the process. Let's break it down step by step:\\n\\n1. The coding sequence of a gene is the region that contains the information necessary for the synthesis of a protein. This region is located within the gene and is responsible for encoding the amino acid sequence of the protein.\\n\\n2. The coding sequence is further divided into different types of sequences, including codons, which are the basic units of genetic code. However, the coding sequence itself is not the same as codons.\\n\\n3. The coding sequence is also composed of exons and introns. Exons are the coding regions that contain the actual genetic information, while introns are non-coding regions that do not contribute to the final protein sequence. The coding sequence is formed by the combination of exons and introns.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is the term that refers to the overall coding sequence of a gene, which includes both exons and introns.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B. exons.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
