    "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for her first influenza virus vaccination. She has a history of untreated hypertension. Her blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min. Shortly after administration of the influenza virus vaccine, she develops shortness of breath, hives, and angioedema. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented this reaction?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Inquiry about an egg allergy",
        "B": "Heterophile agglutination test",
        "C": "Skin test with histamine reagent",
        "D": "\u03b2-Adrenergic blocking agent therapy"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of anaphylaxis, which is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. The most common cause of anaphylaxis is an IgE-mediated reaction, which is often associated with viral vaccines, particularly the influenza vaccine. The symptoms she is experiencing, such as shortness of breath, hives, and angioedema, are consistent with an anaphylactic reaction. To determine if the patient has an egg allergy, which could be a contributing factor to the reaction, it is crucial to assess her medical history. An egg allergy is a common concern for individuals who receive the influenza vaccine because the vaccine is grown in chicken eggs. However, the other options listed do not directly relate to the prevention of anaphylaxis or egg allergy. The heterophile agglutination test is a diagnostic tool used to detect the presence of the H antigen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which is unrelated to this scenario. A skin test with histamine reagent is not a standard method for assessing egg allergy or anaphylaxis. \u03b2-Adrenergic blocking agents are used to treat high blood pressure and are not relevant to the prevention of anaphylaxis or egg allergy in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
