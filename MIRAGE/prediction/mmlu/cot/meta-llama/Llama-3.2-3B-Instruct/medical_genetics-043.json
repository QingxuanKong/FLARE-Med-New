A nonsense mutation is a type of point mutation that results in a premature stop codon in the DNA sequence. This can lead to the synthesis of a truncated, incomplete protein that is often nonfunctional or even toxic. Now, let's analyze each option in relation to nonsense mutations.\\n\\nA. A regulatory sequence is a DNA or RNA sequence that regulates gene expression. While regulatory sequences can be affected by mutations, a nonsense mutation itself is not a regulatory sequence.\\n\\nB. An AG splice acceptor site is a sequence of nucleotides that signals the spliceosome to terminate the splicing process and join the 5' and 3' exons. A nonsense mutation can indeed create a premature stop codon, which can disrupt the splicing process and lead to aberrant splicing, including skipping the AG splice acceptor site. However, the AG splice acceptor site itself is not the mutation.\\n\\nC. The creation of a different amino acid is not a defining characteristic of a nonsense mutation. Nonsense mutations result in a premature stop codon, leading to the synthesis of a truncated protein, not a different amino acid.\\n\\nD. The creation of a stop codon is a hallmark of a nonsense mutation. Nonsense mutations are characterized by the introduction of a premature stop codon, which disrupts the translation process and leads to the synthesis of a truncated protein.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, as a nonsense mutation involves the creation of a stop codon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
