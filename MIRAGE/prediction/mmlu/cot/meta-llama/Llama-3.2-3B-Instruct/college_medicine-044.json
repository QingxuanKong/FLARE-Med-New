    "question": "DNA polymerase creates new DNA by adding complimentary nucleotides to a template strand from the original double-stranded DNA. If a section of the template strand had a ration of 3:2 of A:T bases, what is the ration of A:T in the newly synthesized complimentary strand of DNA?",
    "options": {
        "A": "3:02",
        "B": "1:01",
        "C": "2:03",
        "D": "cannot be determined"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step: 1. **Understanding DNA Base Pairing**: In DNA, A always pairs with T, and G always pairs with C. This is known as complementary base pairing. 2. **Given Ratio of A:T in the Template Strand**: The given ratio of A:T in the template strand is 3:2. This means for every 3 As, there are 2 Ts. 3. **Finding the Complementary Nucleotides**: Since A pairs with T and G pairs with C, the complementary nucleotides for the newly synthesized strand will be G for every A in the template strand, and C for every T. 4. **Calculating the Ratio of A:T in the Newly Synthesized Strand**: Since the ratio of A:T in the template strand is 3:2, the ratio of G:C in the newly synthesized strand will be the same, 3:2. Now, let's look at the choices: - Choice A (3:02) seems incorrect because it has an extra 0 in the second part of the ratio. - Choice B (1:01) does not match the ratio of A:T in the template strand. - Choice C (2:03) is also incorrect for the same reason as choice A; it has an extra 0. - Choice D (cannot be determined) is incorrect because we can determine the ratio. However, since we are asked for the ratio of A:T in the newly synthesized strand, and we know that A pairs with T and G pairs with C, the correct ratio of A:T in the newly synthesized strand will be the inverse of the ratio of A:T in the template strand, which is 2:3. But we are asked for A:T, so we must find the ratio of A in the newly synthesized strand. To do this, we know that for every 3 As in the template strand, there are 2 Ts, and for every 2 Ts, there are 3 Gs (because G pairs with C, and C pairs with T). Therefore, for every 3 As, there are 3 Gs. Thus, the ratio of A:T in the newly synthesized strand is 3:3, which simplifies to 1:1. So, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided, but if we had to choose from the options, the closest answer would be: **A. 3:02**",
