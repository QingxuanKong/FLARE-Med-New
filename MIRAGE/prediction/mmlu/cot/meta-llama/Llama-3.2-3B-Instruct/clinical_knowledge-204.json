        "A": "Sensory loss is demonstrated in a stocking distribution",
        "B": "The tone is increased bilaterally in the legs",
        "C": "Reflexes are very brisk with reinforcement",
        "D": "Weakness is more marked proximally than distally"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the characteristics of peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy refers to damage to the peripheral nerves, which can be caused by various factors such as diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, or injury. The symptoms of peripheral neuropathy can vary depending on the location and type of nerve damage, but some common characteristics include sensory loss, weakness, and changes in reflexes. A. Sensory loss in a stocking distribution is more commonly associated with diabetic neuropathy, where the damage affects the nerves in the feet and legs, causing a loss of sensation in a stocking-like pattern. This is a characteristic feature of peripheral neuropathy. B. Increased tone in the legs is more commonly associated with central nervous system disorders, such as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries, rather than peripheral neuropathy. C. Brisk reflexes are more commonly seen in upper motor neuron lesions, such as those caused by spinal cord injuries or stroke, rather than peripheral neuropathy. D. Weakness in peripheral neuropathy is typically more marked distally, as the damage to the peripheral nerves can cause muscle weakness and wasting in the hands and feet, rather than proximally. Considering these characteristics, the correct answer is A. Sensory loss in a stocking distribution is a common feature of peripheral neuropathy.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
