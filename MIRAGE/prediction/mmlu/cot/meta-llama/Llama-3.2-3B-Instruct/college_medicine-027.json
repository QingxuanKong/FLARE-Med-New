    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To determine the acceleration of the object, let's analyze the forces acting on it. The object is resting on a plane with an angle of incline, so there are two forces acting on it: the force of gravity (Fg) pulling it downwards, and the normal force (Fn) exerted by the plane, which is perpendicular to the plane. Since the object is at rest, the net force acting on it is zero. We can resolve the force of gravity into two components: one parallel to the plane (Fg sin?) and one perpendicular to the plane (Fg cos?). The normal force (Fn) is equal in magnitude to Fg cos?, as it counteracts the component of Fg perpendicular to the plane. The force of friction (Ff) acts opposite to the direction of motion, and its magnitude is given by Ff = \u00b5 Fn. Since Fn = Fg cos?, we can write Ff = \u00b5 Fg cos?. Now, we can resolve the force of friction into two components: one parallel to the plane (Ff sin?) and one perpendicular to the plane (Ff cos?). Since the object is at rest, the component of Ff parallel to the plane must be equal in magnitude to the component of Fg parallel to the plane, i.e., Ff sin? = Fg sin?. We can now write the equation for the net force acting on the object: Fg sin? - Ff sin? = 0 Substituting Ff sin? = Fg sin?, we get: Fg sin? - Fg sin? = 0 Subtracting Fg sin? from both sides gives: 0 = - Fg sin? Dividing both sides by m, we get: a = - g sin? However, this is not among the options. Let's revisit our steps. We can rewrite the equation for the net force acting on the object as: Fg sin? - \u00b5 Fg cos? = 0 Since Fn = Fg cos?, we can rewrite this as: Fg sin? - \u00b5 Fg cos? = 0 Dividing both sides by m, we get: a = g (sin? \u2013 \u00b5 cos?) So, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The acceleration of the object is given by a = g (sin? \u2013 \u00b5 cos?), as the component of the force of gravity parallel to the plane is counteracted by the force of friction, resulting in a net force of zero.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
