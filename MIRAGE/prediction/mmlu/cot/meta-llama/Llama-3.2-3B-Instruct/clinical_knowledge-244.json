    "question": "Two of the following are evident - pain at IV site, erythema, and swelling. What stage on the phlebitis scale is this and what should you do?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Stage 1 - observe cannula.",
        "B": "Stage 2 - re-site cannula.",
        "C": "Stage 3 - re-site cannula and consider treatment.",
        "D": "Stage 0 - do nothing."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's break down the stages of phlebitis and the corresponding symptoms: - Stage 0: No signs of phlebitis, no intervention required. - Stage 1: Mild signs of phlebitis, such as redness or slight swelling at the IV site, but no pain. Observation is recommended. - Stage 2: Moderate signs of phlebitis, including pain at the IV site, erythema (redness), and swelling. This is the stage we are dealing with. - Stage 3: Severe signs of phlebitis, including significant pain, erythema, swelling, and possibly fever. Intervention is required. Given the symptoms of pain at the IV site, erythema, and swelling, this matches the criteria for Stage 2 phlebitis. The recommended action for Stage 2 phlebitis is to re-site the cannula, as it is a moderate stage of phlebitis that requires intervention to prevent further complications. Therefore, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The symptoms of pain at the IV site, erythema, and swelling are consistent with Stage 2 phlebitis. The recommended action for Stage 2 phlebitis is to re-site the cannula to prevent further complications.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Stage 2 - re-site cannula.\"}",
