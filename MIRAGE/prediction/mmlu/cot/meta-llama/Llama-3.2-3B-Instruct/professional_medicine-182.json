Physical examination reveals a\u00a02-cm\u00a0freely movable mass in the lower left lobe of the thyroid. In addition to thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels, the most appropriate initial method to investigate this lesion is",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the nature of the thyroid lump, we need to gather more information about its characteristics and location. The patient presents with a 2-cm freely movable mass in the lower left lobe of the thyroid gland. Given the patient's age and the lack of systemic symptoms, the most likely cause could be a benign lesion, such as a goiter or a thyroid nodule. However, it is essential to rule out any potential malignancies, such as thyroid cancer. Nuclear thyroid scans (options A and B) are useful for evaluating the functional status of the thyroid gland and detecting areas of hyperthyroidism, but they are not the best initial choice for evaluating a thyroid mass. Fine-needle aspiration (option C) is a crucial diagnostic tool for thyroid nodules, but it is typically reserved for nodules with suspicious ultrasound characteristics or those that are fixed or cause symptoms. Given the freely movable nature of this nodule, fine-needle aspiration may not be the initial step. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland (option D) is the most appropriate initial imaging technique for evaluating thyroid masses. It allows for the assessment of the nodule's size, location, echogenicity, and margins, which can help differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. Additionally, ultrasonography can guide the fine-needle aspiration if needed. It is a non-invasive, cost-effective, and widely available test that provides valuable information about the nodule's characteristics, making it the best initial step in evaluating this patient's thyroid lump.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
