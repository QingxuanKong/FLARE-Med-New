    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking: To understand why enzymes are effective in facilitating chemical reactions, let's consider the role of enzymes and the principles of chemical kinetics. Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are highly specific, meaning they only catalyze a particular reaction. The key question is what property of enzymes allows them to accelerate chemical reactions. Option A: \"They raise the temperature of the reaction mixture, thereby speeding up the conversion of reactants to products.\" - This is incorrect because enzymes do not directly raise the temperature of the reaction mixture. While some enzymes may be most active at a certain temperature, their activity is not due to altering the temperature of the reaction mixture. Option B: \"They alter the equilibrium constant of a reaction (K_eq) so that more reactant can be converted to product.\" - This is incorrect because enzymes do not alter the equilibrium constant of a reaction. Enzymes do not change the equilibrium position of a reaction; they only speed up the forward reaction. Option C: \"They increase the maximal rate of the chemical reaction (V_max).\" - While enzymes do increase the rate of reaction, this option is incomplete. The maximal rate of a reaction (V_max) is a property of the reaction itself, not the enzyme. Enzymes increase the rate of reaction by lowering the activation energy, but they do not change the V_max of the reaction. Option D: \"They lower the activation energy, thereby speeding up the conversion of reactants to products.\" - This is correct. Enzymes work by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed. Activation energy is the minimum energy required for reactants to convert into products. By lowering this energy barrier, enzymes enable the reaction to occur faster and more efficiently. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes lower the activation energy required for a reaction to proceed, thereby speeding up the conversion of reactants to products.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
