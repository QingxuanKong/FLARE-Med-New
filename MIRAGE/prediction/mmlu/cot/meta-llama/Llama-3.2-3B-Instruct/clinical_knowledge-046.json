For example, if the DNA sequence is ATCGATCG, the ratio of purines (A and G) to pyrimidines (C and T) is 1:2.\\n\\nThis variability in the ratio of purines to pyrimidines is due to the fact that the sequence of the DNA determines the specific arrangement of the base pairs.\\n\\nTherefore, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule is not fixed or constant, but rather depends on the base sequence in the DNA.\\n\\nThis means that the correct answer is the one that reflects this variability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
