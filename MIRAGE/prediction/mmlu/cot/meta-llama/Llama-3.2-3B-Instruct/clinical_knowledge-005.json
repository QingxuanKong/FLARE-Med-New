    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking: When considering the effects of increasing sprints on the body, we need to understand the metabolic processes involved. During high-intensity, short-duration activities like sprints, the body primarily relies on anaerobic metabolism to generate energy. This is because the oxygen supply cannot keep up with the high demand for energy. As the intensity of the sprint increases, the muscle's energy stores (glycogen) are depleted faster, leading to an increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism. Anaerobic metabolism produces energy through the breakdown of glucose and other substrates without the use of oxygen, resulting in the production of lactic acid and a decrease in pH levels. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Anaerobic contribution progressively increases: This is correct. As the intensity of the sprint increases, the anaerobic contribution to energy production becomes more significant. B. pH of the muscle falls below 6.0: This is also correct. The lactic acid produced during anaerobic metabolism causes a decrease in pH levels, which can lead to muscle fatigue. C. Blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L: This is incorrect. During exercise, especially high-intensity exercise like sprints, blood glucose levels may actually increase due to the release of glucose from stored glycogen. D. Relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases: This is incorrect. As the intensity of the sprint increases, the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism actually decreases, as the body relies more on anaerobic metabolism to generate energy. Therefore, the correct answer is: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When considering the effects of increasing sprints on the body, the anaerobic contribution to energy production becomes more significant due to the depletion of energy stores and the inability of oxygen to keep up with the high demand for energy.
