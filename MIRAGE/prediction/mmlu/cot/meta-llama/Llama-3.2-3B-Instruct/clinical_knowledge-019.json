    "question": "Which of the following is true of facial nerve palsy?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Bells palsy is another term for an upper motor neurone lesion",
        "B": "Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is an upper motor neurone lesion secondary to a Herpes Zoster infection",
        "C": "An inability to close the eyelid on the paralysed side indicates a lower motor neurone lesion",
        "D": "In Bell's Palsy the sense of taste is never affected"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's evaluate each option step by step: 1. Bell's palsy is a condition where the facial nerve (7th cranial nerve) is affected, causing weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles. It is a type of lower motor neuron lesion because it affects the nerve itself, rather than the brain or spinal cord. 2. Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is a condition caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which is the same virus that causes chickenpox and shingles. It is characterized by a facial paralysis (lower motor neuron lesion) and a rash on the ear or forehead. Therefore, option B is incorrect because it describes an upper motor neuron lesion. 3. In Bell's palsy, the inability to close the eyelid on the paralyzed side is a sign of a lower motor neuron lesion, as the facial nerve controls the muscles of facial expression, including the orbicularis oculi muscle, which is responsible for eyelid closure. Therefore, option C is correct. 4. In Bell's palsy, the sense of taste is not always affected, but it can be affected in some cases. The facial nerve carries taste fibers from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, so damage to the nerve can result in a loss of taste on the affected side. Therefore, option D is incorrect. So, the correct answer is C.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
