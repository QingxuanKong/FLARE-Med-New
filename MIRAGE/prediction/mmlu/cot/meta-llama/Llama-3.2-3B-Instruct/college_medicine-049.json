    "question": "Using this formula, if a reaction was provided with 84g of ethane and unlimited oxygen, how many grams of carbon dioxide would result (Carbon atomic weight: 12amu, Hydrogen atomic weight: 1amu, Oxygen atomic weight: 16amu)?\n\ufeff\nThe unbalanced reaction of ethane gas to carbon dioxide and water is as follows:\n\n C2H4 + O2 \u2014> CO2 + H2O",

    "predict": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step: 1. First, we need to calculate the molar mass of ethane (C2H4): - Carbon (C): 2 * 12 amu = 24 amu - Hydrogen (H): 4 * 1 amu = 4 amu - Total molar mass of ethane: 24 amu + 4 amu = 28 amu 2. Next, we need to calculate the molar mass of carbon dioxide (CO2): - Carbon (C): 12 amu - Oxygen (O): 3 * 16 amu = 48 amu - Total molar mass of carbon dioxide: 12 amu + 48 amu = 60 amu 3. Now, we can write the balanced equation: C2H4 + 3O2 -> 2CO2 + 2H2O 4. From the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of ethane (C2H4) produces 2 moles of carbon dioxide (CO2). 5. Given that we have 84g of ethane, we need to find out how many moles of ethane we have: - Number of moles of ethane = mass of ethane / molar mass of ethane = 84g / 28g = 3 moles 6. Since 1 mole of ethane produces 2 moles of carbon dioxide, we can calculate the number of moles of carbon dioxide: - Number of moles of CO2 = 2 * number of moles of ethane = 2 * 3 moles = 6 moles 7. Now, we can calculate the mass of carbon dioxide: - Mass of CO2 = number of moles of CO2 * molar mass of CO2 = 6 moles * 60 amu = 360 amu 8. However, since the answer choices are given in grams, we need to convert the mass of CO2 from amu to grams: - Mass of CO2 in grams = mass of CO2 in amu / 12 (since 1 amu is equal to 1/12 gram) = 360 amu / 12 = 30 grams * 12 = 360 amu / 12 = 30 grams However, I made a calculation mistake above. Let's correct it. 360 amu / 12 = 30 grams. However, we need to multiply that by 3 since there are 3 oxygen atoms in CO2, which is 3*16 = 48 amu. So 360 amu / 12 = 30 grams. Then we multiply that by 3 to get 30*3 = 90 grams.",
