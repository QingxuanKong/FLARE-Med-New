    "question": "A 14-year-old girl has had nausea, intermittent diarrhea, and a 2.2-kg (5-lb) weight loss over the past 4 weeks. Examination shows a migrating serpiginous pruritic perianal rash. Her leukocyte count is 8000/mm3 with 20% eosinophils. Which of the following tests is most likely to yield an accurate diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Blood smear",
        "B": "Bone marrow biopsy",
        "C": "KOH preparation",
        "D": "Microscopic examination of the stool"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of weight loss, nausea, intermittent diarrhea, and a pruritic perianal rash, which is a serpiginous in nature. The elevated eosinophil count (20\\%) further supports the possibility of an eosinophilic disorder. Given the location and description of the rash, as well as the systemic symptoms, a parasitic infection is a strong consideration. The patient's age and symptoms also make lymphoma or other hematological malignancies less likely. The primary goal is to identify the causative agent of the infection, which is likely a parasitic infection given the rash and eosinophilia. The KOH preparation is a rapid and non-invasive test that can be used to diagnose parasitic infections by demonstrating the presence of the parasite or its eggs in a sample of stool or skin scraping. This test is particularly useful for diagnosing infections caused by protozoa or helminths. Given the clinical presentation, the KOH preparation is the most appropriate initial test to yield an accurate diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
