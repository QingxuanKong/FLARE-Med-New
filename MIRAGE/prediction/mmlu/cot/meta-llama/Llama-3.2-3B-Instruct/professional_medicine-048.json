    "question": "A 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 0, aborta 1, at 28 weeks' gestation comes to the office for a prenatal visit. She has had one previous pregnancy resulting in a spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks' gestation. Today, her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 28-week gestation. Fetal ultrasonography shows a male fetus with no abnormalities. Her blood group is O, Rh-negative. The father's blood group is B, Rh-positive. The physician recommends administration of Rho",

        "A": "immune globulin to the patient. This treatment is most likely to prevent which of the following in this mother?",
        "B": "Development of natural killer cells",
        "C": "Development of polycythemia",
        "D": "Formation of antibodies to RhD"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Understanding the situation**: The patient is pregnant with a male fetus at 28 weeks' gestation, and she has a history of a previous spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks' gestation. Her blood group is O, Rh-negative, and her partner's blood group is B, Rh-positive. 2. **Identifying the concern**: The concern here is the potential for the mother's immune system to react to the Rh-positive blood of the fetus, which can lead to the formation of antibodies against RhD, a protein found on the surface of red blood cells. 3. **Understanding the Rh factor**: In Rh-negative individuals, the absence of the RhD protein on red blood cells means that they do not have pre-formed antibodies against RhD. However, if an Rh-negative individual is exposed to Rh-positive blood, their immune system may produce antibodies against RhD, which can cross the placenta and attack the Rh-positive fetus's red blood cells, leading to hemolysis (breakdown) of the fetus's red blood cells. 4. **Considering the options**: - A. Immune globulin: This treatment is used to prevent the formation of antibodies against RhD, but it is typically administered after exposure to Rh-positive blood, not as a preventative measure for an Rh-negative mother with a Rh-positive fetus. - B. Development of natural killer cells: Natural killer cells are part of the immune system, but their development is not directly related to the administration of Rh immune globulin. - C. Development of polycythemia: Polycythemia is a condition characterized by an increase in red blood cells, but it is not directly related to the administration of Rh immune globulin. - D. Formation of antibodies to RhD: This is the correct answer. Rh immune globulin is administered to Rh-negative mothers to prevent the formation of antibodies against RhD, which can lead to hemolysis of the Rh-positive fetus's red blood cells. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is at risk of developing antibodies against RhD due to the Rh-positive blood of the fetus, and Rh immune globulin is administered to prevent the formation of these antibodies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
