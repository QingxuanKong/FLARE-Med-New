    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which nucleotide base is not found in RNA, let's first recall the composition of DNA and RNA. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) contains the nucleotide bases adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). On the other hand, RNA (ribonucleic acid) contains the nucleotide bases adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and uracil (U). The key difference between DNA and RNA is the presence of thymine in DNA and uracil in RNA. Given the options, we can see that thymine is present in DNA but not in RNA, making it the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
