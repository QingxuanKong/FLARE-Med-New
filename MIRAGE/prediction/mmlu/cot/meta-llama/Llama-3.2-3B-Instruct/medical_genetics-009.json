    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the concept of exon skipping and its relationship with the given options. Exon skipping is a process in RNA splicing where a portion of a gene is intentionally removed from the final mRNA transcript. This process occurs when a mutation or splice site disruption leads to the exclusion of an exon from the mature mRNA. Exon skipping can result in the production of a protein with a truncated or altered sequence. Now, let's analyze the options: A. Nonsense mutations: These are point mutations that introduce a premature stop codon into the mRNA, leading to the termination of translation. While nonsense mutations can cause exon skipping, they are not the primary cause of this phenomenon. B. Regulatory mutations: These are mutations that affect the regulation of gene expression, such as enhancers, promoters, or silencers. Regulatory mutations can influence exon skipping, but they are not the direct cause of this process. C. RNA processing mutations: These are mutations that occur during the RNA splicing process, including exon skipping. RNA processing mutations can lead to the removal of exons from the mRNA transcript, resulting in exon skipping. D. Silent mutations: These are point mutations that do not alter the amino acid sequence of the final protein product. Silent mutations are not directly related to exon skipping. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Exon skipping is a process that occurs during RNA splicing, where a portion of a gene is intentionally removed from the final mRNA transcript. This process is primarily caused by RNA processing mutations, which can disrupt the normal splicing process and lead to the exclusion of an exon from the mature mRNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
