    "question": "A 57-year-old woman comes to the office for a preoperative evaluation 2 weeks before undergoing scheduled laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and the patient takes no medications. Family history is significant for stable angina in her father and rheumatoid arthritis in her mother. The patient has a 102-year-old grandmother who resides in a nursing care facility and has Parkinson disease. The patient does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages. During the interview, her face is expressionless. She has a flexed posture and is unable to open her mouth wide. She is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 81 kg (179 lb); BMI is 27 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses thickening and hardening of the skin over the dorsum of the hands and forearms, as well as mild kyphosis. Strength testing shows no abnormalities; muscle tension is normal. Passive and active range of motion of the upper extremities is full. Gait is slow and deliberate. The remainder of the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Prior to surgery, further evaluation is indicated for which of the following conditions in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Parkinson disease",
        "B": "Progressive supranuclear palsy",
        "C": "Sarcopenia",
        "D": "Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a complex clinical picture that warrants further evaluation. The key findings include thickening and hardening of the skin over the dorsum of the hands and forearms (sclerodactyly), mild kyphosis, a flexed posture, and an inability to open her mouth wide, which are all suggestive of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). The patient's slow and deliberate gait may be indicative of autonomic dysfunction, a common feature of systemic sclerosis. The patient's age and family history of rheumatoid arthritis also support this consideration. The patient's BMI is within the normal range, and there are no other obvious signs of malnutrition or muscle wasting, which makes sarcopenia less likely. Parkinson disease is unlikely given the patient's normal muscle strength, normal range of motion, and lack of other parkinsonian features. Progressive supranuclear palsy is also unlikely given the patient's normal muscle strength and range of motion. Therefore, further evaluation for systemic sclerosis is warranted to determine the extent of the disease and its impact on the patient's overall health and surgical risk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
