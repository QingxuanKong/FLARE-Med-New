        "A": "By selective transcription of different parts of the DNA in the gene.",
        "B": "By doubling or tripling the length of the mRNA molecule produced from the primary transcript.",
        "C": "The primary transcripts of many genes can be spliced in various ways to produce different mRNAs, a process known as alternative RNA splicing.",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking: To determine how several different proteins can be produced from the same gene, let's break down the process of gene expression: 1. **Transcription**: The first step in gene expression is transcription, where the genetic information in the DNA is copied into a complementary RNA molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). This process is a one-way conversion, meaning that the same DNA sequence is always transcribed into the same type of mRNA. 2. **Translation**: The next step is translation, where the mRNA is translated into a specific protein. This is also a one-way process, meaning that the same mRNA molecule will always be translated into the same protein. Now, let's examine the options: - **Option A**: Doubling or tripling the length of the mRNA molecule would result in a different protein being produced, as the different length mRNA would be translated into a different protein. However, this is not how the cell achieves the diversity of proteins from a single gene. - **Option B**: This option is incorrect because the length of the mRNA molecule does not determine the type of protein produced. The translation process is what determines the protein type, not the length of the mRNA. - **Option C**: Alternative RNA splicing is a process that occurs during transcription, where the primary transcript is spliced together in different ways to produce different mRNAs. This can result in different proteins being produced from the same gene, as different splicing patterns can lead to different protein isoforms. - **Option D**: Splicing of the mRNA molecule after it has been formed from the primary transcript is not a recognized mechanism for producing different proteins from the same gene. The splicing of the primary transcript during transcription is the key process that allows for diversity in protein production. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alternative RNA splicing during transcription allows for the production of different proteins from the same gene by splicing the primary transcript in various ways.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
