    "question": "Four days after undergoing open reduction and internal fixation of a fracture of the right femur sustained in a motor vehicle collision, a 47-year-old man continues to have agitation and confusion despite treatment with haloperidol. He has mild hypertension. Other medications include acetaminophen, atenolol, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 168/98 mm Hg. During the examination, he is uncooperative and refuses to answer questions. Neurologic examination shows tremulousness and no focal findings. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. A CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Adverse effect of medication",
        "B": "Alcohol withdrawal",
        "C": "Fat emboli",
        "D": "Sepsis"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 47-year-old man who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of a fracture of the right femur 4 days ago. He is experiencing agitation, confusion, and tremulousness, and has a history of mild hypertension. The patient is uncooperative and refuses to answer questions, but is oriented to person. The CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities, ruling out any obvious intracranial hemorrhage or other structural abnormalities. The patient is also on several medications, including haloperidol, atenolol, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. The patient's symptoms of agitation, confusion, and tremulousness, despite being oriented to person, could be indicative of a variety of conditions. However, the key clue here is the patient's recent history of surgery and the presence of tremulousness, which suggests a possible side effect of medication. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication, is known to cause extrapyramidal side effects such as tremors and agitation, especially in elderly patients. The other options can be ruled out based on the information provided. Sepsis would likely present with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, which are not present in this patient. Fat emboli could cause neurological symptoms, but would also likely present with other signs of respiratory distress and possibly petechiae or ecchymoses, which are not mentioned. Alcohol withdrawal could cause agitation and confusion, but the patient's refusal to answer questions and the lack of any history of alcohol use makes this less likely. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's findings is an adverse effect of medication, specifically haloperidol, which is known to cause extrapyramidal side effects in some patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
