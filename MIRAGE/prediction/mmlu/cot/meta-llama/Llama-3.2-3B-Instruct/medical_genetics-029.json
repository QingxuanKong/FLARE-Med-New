    "predict": "To determine the probability that each child will be affected, we need to understand the genetics of autosomal recessive disorders. In autosomal recessive disorders, a person needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to be affected. Let's break it down step by step: 1. **Parental genotypes and phenotypes**: Since both parents are affected, we can assume they are homozygous recessive for the mutated gene, meaning they have the genotype \"rr\" (where \"r\" represents the mutated gene). 2. **Possible genotypes and phenotypes of offspring**: When two homozygous recessive parents produce offspring, the possible genotypes and phenotypes of the children are: - 25% chance of the child being homozygous recessive (rr) - 50% chance of the child being heterozygous (Rr) - 25% chance of the child being homozygous dominant (RR) 3. **Phenotype probability**: - The child who is homozygous recessive (rr) will definitely be affected. - The child who is heterozygous (Rr) will not be affected. - The child who is homozygous dominant (RR) will not be affected. Considering these probabilities, the chance that each child will be affected (homozygous recessive) is 25%. Therefore, the probability that each child will be affected is 1 in 4. ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the probability that each child will be affected, we need to understand the genetics of autosomal recessive disorders.
