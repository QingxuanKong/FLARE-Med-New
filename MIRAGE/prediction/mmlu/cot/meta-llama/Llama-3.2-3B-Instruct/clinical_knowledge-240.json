    "question": "Approximately how many kJ of energy are expended if an athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake averages 3.0 l/min for 5 minutes of exercise?",
    "options": {
        "A": "60 kJ",
        "B": "150 kJ",
        "C": "300 kJ",
        "D": "500 kJ"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this problem, we need to know the energy yield of oxygen during exercise. The energy yield of oxygen is approximately 4.8 kJ/l. Step 1: Convert oxygen uptake from liters per minute (l/min) to liters (L) by multiplying it with the time of exercise in minutes. Oxygen uptake = 3.0 l/min * 5 min = 15 L Step 2: Multiply the oxygen uptake in liters by the energy yield of oxygen to get the total energy expended in kJ. Energy expended = Oxygen uptake * Energy yield of oxygen Energy expended = 15 L * 4.8 kJ/L = 72 kJ Since the question asks for an approximate value and the closest answer choice to our calculated value is not available, we can round our result to the nearest answer choice. The closest answer choice to 72 kJ is 75 kJ, but since it's not an option, we will have to choose the closest answer which is 70 kJ, however, the closest answer to our result is 75 kJ, but it's not available, so we will choose the closest available answer which is 60 kJ, however, that is not the exact answer. However, since the question asks for an approximate answer, we should choose the closest available answer which is A. 60 kJ",
