    "question": "A 24-year-old recent college graduate comes to the office because of a 3-year history of increased frequency of urination and occasional incontinence whenever she travels. She says the urinary symptoms typically begin a few days before she is going to fly and they stop the day after she arrives at her destination. She says she is anxious about flying and even slightly \"panicky.\" She reports having had similar but milder symptoms prior to examinations before graduating. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Urinalysis and urine culture are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Recommend behavioral therapy",
        "B": "Recommend psychoanalytic psychotherapy",
        "C": "Recommend that the patient avoid any stressful activities that cause the problem",
        "D": "Review the patient's sexual history"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and presentation. The patient is a 24-year-old recent college graduate experiencing increased frequency of urination and occasional incontinence, which worsens before flying and resolves after arrival. This pattern suggests a stress-related urinary issue. The patient's anxiety about flying and mild symptoms prior to previous examinations also point towards a stress-related cause. The patient's medical history and physical examination are unremarkable, and the urinalysis and urine culture are normal, which further supports a non-infectious cause. Given the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is stress urinary incontinence, which is a common condition associated with stress and anxiety. The next step would be to address the underlying psychological cause of her symptoms rather than focusing on physical or behavioral modifications. Behavioral therapy is a common treatment approach for stress-related urinary incontinence, which can help the patient manage her anxiety and alleviate symptoms. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy may also be beneficial, but it is not as commonly used or evidence-based for this condition. Recommending that the patient avoid stressful activities may not address the underlying cause and could be unrealistic. Reviewing the patient's sexual history is not directly relevant to her current symptoms and may be unnecessary at this time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
