        "A": "Bowing of a long bone is a characteristic feature",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option given in relation to Paget's Disease.\\n\\nPaget's Disease is a chronic bone disorder that involves the breakdown and regrowth of bone tissue, leading to bone deformities and deformities. It primarily affects the bones of the hips, spine, and pelvis, but can also affect other bones in the body.\\n\\nOption A: Bowing of a long bone is a characteristic feature - This is true. Paget's Disease is known for causing deformities due to the abnormal bone growth and resorption, which can lead to bowing of long bones, especially in the legs.\\n\\nOption B: Spinal cord compression is a common complication - This is true. As Paget's Disease progresses, it can cause vertebrae to collapse, leading to spinal cord compression. This can result in neurological symptoms such as numbness, weakness, and loss of bladder and bowel control.\\n\\nOption C: Heart failure is not a recognized complication - This is false. While Paget's Disease primarily affects bones, it can also have systemic effects, including cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, especially in advanced cases.\\n\\nOption D: Pathological fractures are not a feature - This is false. Pathological fractures are a common complication of Paget's Disease, as the weakened bone structure can lead to fractures.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is: B. Spinal cord compression is a common complication.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
