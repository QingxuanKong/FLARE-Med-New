        "A": "Acetylcholine",
        "B": "Cholecystokinin",
        "C": "Deoxyribose",
        "D": "Oxytocin"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. First, we need to understand the role of each substance in the human body. 2. Acetylcholine (A) is a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in transmitting nerve impulses to muscles, particularly in the neuromuscular junction. 3. Cholecystokinin (B) is a hormone involved in digestion, particularly in the release of digestive enzymes from the pancreas. 4. Deoxyribose (C) is a sugar molecule found in DNA, but it is not directly involved in transmitting nerve impulses. 5. Oxytocin (D) is a hormone involved in social bonding, childbirth, and lactation, but it is not directly involved in transmitting nerve impulses to muscles. Considering the role of each substance, we can conclude that Acetylcholine is the substance that aids the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. \", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
