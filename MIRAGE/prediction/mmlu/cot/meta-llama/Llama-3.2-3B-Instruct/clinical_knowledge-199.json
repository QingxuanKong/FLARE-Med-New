    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the characteristics of fast-twitch fibres. Fast-twitch fibres are a type of skeletal muscle fibre that are designed for short, high-intensity, rapid contractions. They are primarily used for activities like sprinting, jumping, and other explosive movements. Given their function, we can infer that they require a lot of energy to function, which means they need to be able to generate ATP quickly. This is achieved through a high ATPase activity. ATPase is an enzyme that breaks down ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate, releasing energy that can be used by the muscle to contract. A high ATPase activity means that fast-twitch fibres can quickly regenerate ATP, allowing for rapid muscle contractions. On the other hand, slow-twitch fibres, which are used for endurance activities like distance running, have a lower ATPase activity and rely on a more efficient, longer-term energy production mechanism that involves a larger number of mitochondria. Therefore, fast-twitch fibres should have a high ATPase activity to meet their energy demands.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
