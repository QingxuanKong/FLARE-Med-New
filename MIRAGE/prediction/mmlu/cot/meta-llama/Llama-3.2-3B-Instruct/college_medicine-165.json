    "predict": "To solve this question, let's analyze the energy yield from FADH2 and NADH+H in cellular respiration. In cellular respiration, the electron transport chain (ETC) generates ATP from the energy released when electrons from NADH+H and FADH2 are passed through the ETC. The energy yield from these electron carriers is as follows: - Each NADH+H yields approximately 2.5 ATP. - Each FADH2 yields approximately 1.5 ATP. Now, let's calculate the total energy yield: - 2.5 ATP from NADH+H - 1.5 ATP from FADH2 Total ATP yield = 2.5 + 1.5 = 4 ATP Therefore, the pairs of electrons carried in the form of FADH2 and NADH+H collectively contain enough free energy to rephosphorylate 4 ATP. Here is the output in JSON format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to calculate the energy yield from FADH2 and NADH+H in cellular respiration.
