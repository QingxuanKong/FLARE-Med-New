    "question": "A study examined admissions to exceptionally selective colleges. When examining the correlates of admission acceptance, two obvious factors that strongly correlated with admissions were GPA and standardized test scores, with correlation values of +0.41 and +0.55 respectively. However, the study also demonstrated that those students who had social networks that overlapped with the alumni networks of the selective colleges were even more likely to be admitted, with a correlation between social network and alumni network of +0.61. This correlation demonstrates:",

        "A": "the value of cultural capital.",

        "D": "a false association."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the information and analyze it step by step: 1. **Understanding the Correlations:** - The study found strong correlations between GPA, standardized test scores, and admission to exceptionally selective colleges. These correlations indicate that students with higher GPAs and better standardized test scores are more likely to be admitted. - The correlation between social network and alumni network is +0.61, which is stronger than the correlations between GPA and admission, and between standardized test scores and admission. 2. **Understanding the Concepts:** - **Meritocracy** (B) refers to a system where rewards are given based on merit, where the most qualified or talented individuals receive the most benefits. However, the presence of a strong correlation between social network and alumni network suggests that social connections play a significant role, which contradicts the idea of a meritocracy. - **Cultural Capital** (A) refers to the social assets that give individuals access to resources and opportunities. While cultural capital can be an important factor, the study specifically highlights the role of social networks, not cultural capital. - **Social Capital** (C) refers to the networks and relationships that provide access to resources, opportunities, and information. The strong correlation between social network and alumni network suggests that having connections to the college's alumni network provides a significant advantage in the admission process. - **False Association** (D) implies that there is no actual relationship between the variables. However, the study's findings suggest a strong positive correlation, indicating that social networks do play a significant role in the admission process. **Conclusion:** Given the information and analysis, the correct answer is **C. the value of social capital**. The study demonstrates that having social networks that overlap with the alumni networks of the selective colleges provides a significant advantage in the admission process, highlighting the value of social capital in securing admission. ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study found strong correlations between GPA, standardized test scores, and admission, but the strongest correlation was between social network and alumni network, indicating that social capital plays a significant role in securing admission.
