The organ must remove bilirubin from the blood: This function is typically associated with the liver, as it is responsible for detoxifying the blood and removing waste products, including bilirubin. 2. The organ must manufacture plasma proteins: The liver is also responsible for producing most of the proteins found in plasma, including albumin, globulins, and clotting factors such as prothrombin and fibrinogen. 3. The organ must be involved in the production of prothrombin and fibrinogen: As mentioned earlier, the liver is responsible for producing these clotting factors. Considering these functions, the liver is the only organ that meets all the criteria mentioned in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
