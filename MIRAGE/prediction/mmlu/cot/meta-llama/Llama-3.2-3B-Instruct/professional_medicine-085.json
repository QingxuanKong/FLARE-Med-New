    "question": "A 54-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe jaw pain since undergoing a painful dental procedure 1 day ago. The patient was prescribed codeine after the procedure and instructed to take the medication every 4 hours, but she has continued pain despite adherence to this analgesic regimen. Other members of her family also have experienced poor pain control with codeine. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Decreased absorption of codeine",
        "B": "Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine",
        "C": "Deficiency of \u03ba receptors",
        "D": "Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of codeine and its active metabolite, morphine. Codeine is a prodrug that is converted to morphine in the liver, which is responsible for its analgesic effects. However, the patient's family members also experiencing poor pain control with codeine suggests a genetic variation that affects the metabolism or action of codeine. One possible explanation is a deficiency of the enzyme responsible for converting codeine to morphine, which would lead to reduced analgesic efficacy. Another possibility is a genetic variation in the opioid receptor, specifically the kappa (\u03ba) receptor, which plays a role in the analgesic effect of opioids. However, the patient's family members experiencing poor pain control also suggests a genetic component, but it is less likely to be related to the opioid receptor itself. Decreased absorption of codeine or increased plasma protein-binding of codeine are less likely explanations for the patient's poor pain control, as these factors would likely affect the patient's pain levels regardless of their family members' response. Therefore, the most likely explanation is a deficiency of the enzyme responsible for converting codeine to morphine, which would lead to reduced analgesic efficacy in the patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
