    "question": "Targeting of a newly synthesized protein is most likely to require two different signal peptides for which of the following destinations?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Plasma membrane",
        "B": "Lysosome",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's break down the process of targeting a newly synthesized protein to different cellular destinations. 1. **Protein Synthesis**: The protein is first synthesized on ribosomes, where it is translated into a polypeptide chain. 2. **Signal Peptide Recognition**: The polypeptide chain contains one or more signal peptides, which are short sequences of amino acids that signal the cell where the protein should be directed. These signal peptides are recognized by specific receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Now, let's consider the options: - **A. Plasma Membrane**: Proteins destined for the plasma membrane typically have a signal peptide that targets them to the ER, which then processes and sorts them into vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane. However, the plasma membrane itself is not a site of protein synthesis. - **B. Lysosome**: Lysosomal proteins often have a signal peptide that targets them to the Golgi apparatus, which then sorts and packages them into lysosomal vesicles. Like the plasma membrane, lysosomes are not sites of protein synthesis. - **C. Cytosol**: Proteins destined for the cytosol typically lack a signal peptide, as they are not transported into the ER or Golgi apparatus. - **D. Chloroplast**: Chloroplast proteins, found in plant cells, often have a signal peptide that targets them to the ER, which then processes and sorts them into vesicles that fuse with the chloroplast. However, the chloroplast is a organelle found in plant cells, not all cells. Considering these points, the only organelle that requires two different signal peptides for targeting a newly synthesized protein is the **Chloroplast**. Chloroplasts require the ER to process and sort chloroplast proteins, which involves two signal peptides: one for targeting to the ER and another for targeting to the chloroplast. Therefore, the correct answer is: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Proteins destined for the chloroplast require two different signal peptides for targeting: one for targeting to the ER and another for targeting to the chloroplast.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" } ```",
