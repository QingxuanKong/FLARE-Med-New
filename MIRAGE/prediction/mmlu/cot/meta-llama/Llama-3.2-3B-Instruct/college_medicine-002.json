    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option one by one.\\n\\nFirst, we need to understand what a chemically based sensory system is. A chemically based sensory system is one that detects chemical substances or changes in the body or environment through chemical receptors. This type of sensory system is typically associated with the sense of smell and taste.\\n\\nNow, let's examine each option:\\n\\nI. Gustatory system: The gustatory system, also known as the sense of taste, is indeed a chemically based sensory system. It detects chemical substances in food and drinks through taste receptors on the tongue. Therefore, this option is correct.\\n\\nII. Auditory system: The auditory system, on the other hand, is a mechanically based sensory system. It detects sound waves through the ears and the inner ear. This system is not based on chemicals, but rather on mechanical vibrations. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\\n\\nIII. Olfactory system: The olfactory system, also known as the sense of smell, is a chemically based sensory system. It detects chemical substances in the air through olfactory receptors in the nose. Therefore, this option is also correct.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, both the gustatory and olfactory systems are chemically based sensory systems. Therefore, the correct answer is D. I and III only.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
