    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the functions of the frontal lobe of the brain's cortex. The frontal lobe is a critical region responsible for various higher-order cognitive functions. Let's analyze each option given: Option A: The sleep/wake cycle is primarily regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus, not the frontal lobe. Option B: The ability to draw shapes is a task that involves motor skills and cognitive functions, but it is more closely associated with the parietal lobe and the premotor cortex, rather than the frontal lobe. Option C: The frontal lobe is indeed involved in social cognition, including understanding others' speech, as it contains areas such as Broca's area and Wernicke's area, which are critical for language processing. Option D: Visual perception is primarily processed in the occipital lobe, with the lateral occipital complex (LOC) being a key region for object recognition. Considering the above information, the correct answer is related to understanding others' speech, which is a function of the frontal lobe, specifically areas like Broca's and Wernicke's areas.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
