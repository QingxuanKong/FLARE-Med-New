    "question": "Which potential complication of IV therapy is described thus: 'Leakage of vesicant (irritant) medication or fluid into surrounding tissues, causing tissue damage'?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Extravasation.",
        "B": "Phlebitis.",
        "C": "Inflammation.",
        "D": "Infiltration."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option given and its relation to the description provided. First, we need to understand what'vesicant' and 'irritant' medications are. Vesicants are a type of chemical irritant that can cause chemical burns upon contact with tissues. These are often used in chemotherapy to treat cancer. Irritants can also cause tissue damage and inflammation. Now, let's look at each option: A. Extravasation: This refers to the leakage of fluid or medication from a blood vessel into the surrounding tissues. Given the description of vesicant or irritant causing tissue damage, this seems to be a strong candidate for the correct answer. B. Phlebitis: This is inflammation of a vein, which can be caused by IV therapy, but it does not directly relate to the leakage of vesicant or irritant into surrounding tissues. C. Inflammation: While inflammation is a possible outcome of tissue damage, it is a broader term and not as directly related to the specific description of vesicant or irritant leakage. D. Infiltration: This term refers to the entry of substances into tissues, but it does not specifically imply the leakage of vesicant or irritant medication. Considering the options, extravasation directly matches the description provided in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
