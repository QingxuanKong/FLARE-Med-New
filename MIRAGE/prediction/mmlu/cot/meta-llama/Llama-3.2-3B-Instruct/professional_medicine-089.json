    "question": "A 15-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of acne. Breast and pubic hair development began at the age of 12 years. Menarche occurred at the age of 14 years. Physical examination shows scattered open and closed comedones over the cheeks and forehead. Breast and pubic hair development are Tanner stage 5. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's acne?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Increased estrogen stimulation of the sebaceous glands",
        "B": "Increased responsiveness of the sebaceous glands to follicle-stimulating hormone",
        "C": "Increased sympathetic stimulation to the sebaceous glands",
        "D": "Stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and physical examination: 1. The patient is 15 years old and has a 3-month history of acne. 2. She started experiencing breast and pubic hair development at the age of 12, and menarche occurred at 14. 3. Physical examination shows scattered open and closed comedones over the cheeks and forehead. 4. Breast and pubic hair development are Tanner stage 5, which is a late stage of pubertal development. Given these points, we can infer that the patient is in the midst of puberty, and her acne is likely related to hormonal changes. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Increased estrogen stimulation of the sebaceous glands: Estrogen can stimulate the sebaceous glands, but it is not the primary hormone associated with the development of acne in females. Estrogen levels typically increase during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, but they do not cause acne. B. Increased responsiveness of the sebaceous glands to follicle-stimulating hormone: Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is not directly related to acne. FSH is involved in the regulation of the reproductive cycle, but it is not a primary hormone involved in the development of acne. C. Increased sympathetic stimulation to the sebaceous glands: The sympathetic nervous system can cause vasoconstriction and increase the production of sebum, but it is not the primary cause of acne in females. D. Stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens: Androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are known to stimulate the sebaceous glands, leading to increased sebum production and acne. The patient's breast and pubic hair development, as well as Tanner stage 5 development, suggest high levels of androgens. Androgens are also known to cause acne in females, particularly during puberty. Considering these points, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's acne is the stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
