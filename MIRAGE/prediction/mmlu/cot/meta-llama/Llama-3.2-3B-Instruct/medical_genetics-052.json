    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down the concept of positional cloning step by step.\\n\\nPositional cloning is a technique used in molecular biology to identify the location of a specific gene on a chromosome. It involves the following steps:\\n\\n1. Identifying the gene of interest: The gene to be cloned is identified through its functional characteristics or by studying its expression patterns.\\n2. Mapping the gene to a chromosomal region: The gene is mapped to a specific region on a chromosome using techniques such as linkage analysis or genomic sequencing.\\n3. Isolating the genomic DNA from the mapped region: The genomic DNA from the mapped region is isolated using techniques such as PCR or chromosome walking.\\n4. Cloning the genomic DNA: The isolated genomic DNA is then cloned into a vector, such as a plasmid, to create multiple copies of the gene.\\n\\nGiven these steps, let's examine the options provided:\\n\\nA. Using a selection procedure to clone a cDNA: This option is incorrect because positional cloning involves cloning a genomic DNA, not cDNA.\\nB. Cloning a portion of a gene using PCR: This option is partially correct in that PCR is used in the cloning process, but it does not fully describe positional cloning.\\nC. Isolating a gene by PCR using primers from another species: This option is incorrect because positional cloning involves isolating a gene from the genomic DNA of the same species, not using primers from another species.\\nD. Mapping a gene to a chromosomal region and then identifying and cloning a genomic copy of the gene from the region: This option accurately describes the steps involved in positional cloning.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
