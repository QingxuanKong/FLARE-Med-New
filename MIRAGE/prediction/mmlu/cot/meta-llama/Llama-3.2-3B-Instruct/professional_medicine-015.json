    "question": "A 45-year-old limousine driver comes to the office for an initial appointment because he would like you to fill out and sign a legal document at the request of his attorney. The patient states that he is filing a lawsuit against the limousine company that employs him because he developed post-traumatic stress disorder following a motor vehicle collision. He appears irritable and tense as he provides his history. He relays his symptoms by reading them aloud from a written list. At this time, which of the following is the most appropriate approach toward confirming the underlying diagnosis of this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Administer amobarbital and then interview the patient",
        "B": "Ask the patient to provide a narrative with detailed description of the incident and of his symptoms",
        "C": "Interview the patient under hypnosis",
        "D": "Interview the patient while paying close attention to his willingness to make eye contact"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To confirm the underlying diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in this patient, the most appropriate approach is crucial. The patient has already provided a written list of symptoms, which indicates that he is willing to share his experiences, but the information provided is not a comprehensive narrative. The patient's irritability and tension suggest that he may be anxious about sharing more information. Option A, administering amobarbital, is not a suitable approach as it is a sedative and can impair the patient's ability to provide accurate information. Option C, interviewing the patient under hypnosis, is also not recommended as hypnosis can be unreliable in diagnosing PTSD and may not be ethically justifiable in a clinical setting. Option D, interviewing the patient while paying close attention to his willingness to make eye contact, may provide some insight into his emotional state but does not directly assess the patient's symptoms or the severity of PTSD. Option B, asking the patient to provide a narrative with a detailed description of the incident and his symptoms, is the most appropriate approach. This will allow the clinician to gather a comprehensive understanding of the patient's experiences, assess the severity of his symptoms, and make an informed diagnosis. By asking the patient to describe his symptoms in his own words, the clinician can also gauge his ability to recall and process traumatic memories, which is a critical aspect of diagnosing PTSD.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
