    "question": "Which of the following is a benefit that mycorrhizal fungi confer to many plants?",
    "options": {
        "A": "They protect plant roots from desiccation in extremely dry habitats.",
        "B": "They fix nitrogen, which is particularly important for plants in nitrogen-limited habitats.",
        "C": "They provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils.",
        "D": "They provide carbon to plants in exchange for fixed nitrogen."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option given and consider the role of mycorrhizal fungi in plant development and nutrient cycling.\\n\\nOption A: Mycorrhizal fungi do not primarily protect plant roots from desiccation. While they can help plants survive in dry habitats by providing water and nutrients, this is not their main function.\\n\\nOption B: Nitrogen fixation is primarily the role of bacteria, such as Rhizobia, which live in symbiosis with legume plants. Mycorrhizal fungi do not fix nitrogen.\\n\\nOption C: Mycorrhizal fungi do provide access to phosphorus, an essential nutrient for plant growth. They form symbiotic relationships with plant roots, increasing the surface area for phosphorus uptake and facilitating its absorption from the soil.\\n\\nOption D: Mycorrhizal fungi do not provide carbon to plants in exchange for fixed nitrogen. This description fits the symbiotic relationship between algae and cyanobacteria, not mycorrhizal fungi.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. They provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
