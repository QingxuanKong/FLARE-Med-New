    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's break down the process step by step: 1. **Understanding the purpose of cannula flushing**: Cannula flushing is a process used to prevent bacterial growth and blockage in intravenous (IV) lines. It involves the administration of a saline solution to the IV line to clear out any debris or bacteria that may have accumulated. 2. **Clinical guidelines and recommendations**: The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) and other medical organizations provide guidelines for IV line maintenance. According to these guidelines, IV lines should be flushed after every 72 hours of use or when a blockage is suspected. 3. **Comparing the options**: Given the options provided, we need to determine which one aligns with the recommended frequency for flushing a cannula. Options A, B, C, and D suggest flushing every 4, 8, 12, and 16 hours, respectively. 4. **Analysis of each option**: - A (Every 4 hours): This is too frequent, as it would be wasteful and may not be necessary unless there's a specific reason for more frequent flushing. - B (Every 8 hours): This is still relatively frequent, but it's more in line with some guidelines that suggest flushing IV lines every 8-12 hours. - C (Every 12 hours): This is a reasonable option, as it aligns with the general recommendation of flushing every 72 hours or when a blockage is suspected. - D (Every 16 hours): This is less frequent than recommended and may not adequately prevent bacterial growth and blockages. 5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is C (Every 12 hours), as it is in line with the general recommendation for IV line maintenance and flushing frequency. ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, we considered the purpose of cannula flushing, clinical guidelines, and analyzed each option.
