    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the master gland of the endocrine system, we need to consider the role and function of each gland mentioned in the options.\\n\\nThe adrenal glands (A) are located on top of the kidneys and produce hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which help with stress response and blood pressure regulation. While they play a crucial role in the endocrine system, they are not considered the master gland.\\n\\nThe pancreas (B) is an organ that produces hormones like insulin and glucagon, which regulate blood sugar levels. It also produces digestive enzymes to help break down food. However, it is not the master gland of the endocrine system.\\n\\nThe pineal gland (C) is a small endocrine gland located in the brain that produces melatonin, a hormone involved in regulating sleep-wake cycles. Although it is an important gland, it is not the master gland.\\n\\nThe pituitary gland (D) is often referred to as the master gland because it produces hormones that regulate the function of many other endocrine glands in the body. It controls the production of hormones in the thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, and reproductive glands, among others. This makes it a critical regulator of the endocrine system.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Pituitary gland.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
