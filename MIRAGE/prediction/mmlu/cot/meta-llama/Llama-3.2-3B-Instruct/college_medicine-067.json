    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the concept of self-efficacy and the strategies that are typically employed to raise it. Self-efficacy refers to an individual's belief in their ability to succeed in specific situations or achieve certain goals. Effective strategies for building self-efficacy involve practicing, learning from failures, and receiving feedback. Here's a step-by-step analysis: 1. **Seeking positive feedback from friends (A)**: This can be a helpful strategy for building self-efficacy. Positive feedback from others can reinforce an individual's existing self-efficacy and provide motivation to continue working towards their goals. Therefore, this is a strategy that a therapist might encourage. 2. **Putting in daily practice on the tasks she wishes to improve on (B)**: This is a fundamental strategy for building self-efficacy. By practicing and achieving success in tasks, an individual can develop a sense of mastery and confidence in their abilities. This is a typical approach used in many self-efficacy interventions. 3. **Finding others her age and ability who excel at tasks she is interested in (C)**: This can also be a helpful strategy. Observing others who excel in specific areas can provide inspiration, motivation, and a sense of connection to others who share similar interests and abilities. This can enhance an individual's self-efficacy by showing that others can achieve success in the same areas they aspire to. 4. **Avoiding potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks she is not proficient in (D)**: This option does not align with the principles of building self-efficacy. In fact, avoiding challenges can have the opposite effect, as it can reinforce feelings of inadequacy and low self-efficacy. Effective self-efficacy strategies involve taking on challenges and learning from failures, rather than avoiding them. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Avoiding potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks she is not proficient in is not a strategy that would help raise Karen's sense of self-efficacy, as it can actually hinder her progress and reinforce feelings of inadequacy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
