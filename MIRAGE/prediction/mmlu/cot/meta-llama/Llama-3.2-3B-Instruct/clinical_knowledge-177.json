    "options": {
        "A": "IV administration of a drug will delay its action.",
        "B": "IV administration carries low risk of bacteraemia.",
        "C": "IV administration allows titration of a drug with its desired effect.",
        "D": "An intravenous cannula should never be used for both drug and fluid administration."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's evaluate each option step by step: 1. **Option A: IV administration of a drug will delay its action.** - This statement is false. IV administration actually allows for rapid onset of action because the drug is administered directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract and first-pass metabolism. 2. **Option B: IV administration carries low risk of bacteraemia.** - This statement is false. IV administration carries a risk of bacteraemia (infection) if the catheter becomes contaminated. This risk can be minimized with proper sterile technique and catheter care. 3. **Option C: IV administration allows titration of a drug with its desired effect.** - This statement is true. IV administration allows for precise control over the dosage and rate of administration, making it easy to titrate a drug to achieve the desired effect. 4. **Option D: An intravenous cannula should never be used for both drug and fluid administration.** - This statement is false. While it is recommended to use separate cannulas for drug and fluid administration to minimize contamination risk, it is not a hard and fast rule. However, proper sterile technique and cannula selection should be followed to minimize risks. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
