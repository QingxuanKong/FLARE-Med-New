    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the characteristics of angiosperms (flowering plants). Angiosperms are a group of plants that have evolved a specific reproductive strategy. Let's examine each option given: A. Wind-borne pollen: While many angiosperms produce pollen that can be blown by the wind, this is not a unique characteristic exclusive to angiosperms. Other plant groups, such as conifers and gymnosperms, also produce wind-borne pollen. B. A dominant sporophyte life cycle: Angiosperms do have a dominant sporophyte life cycle, but this is not unique to them. Many other plant groups, including ferns and gymnosperms, also exhibit a dominant sporophyte life cycle. C. Alteration of generations: This term refers to the process where the gametes (sperm and egg cells) of a plant are produced in the gametophyte generation, and the zygote is formed in the sporophyte generation. While this is true for angiosperms, it is not unique to them. Many other plant groups, including ferns and mosses, also exhibit this characteristic. D. Double fertilization: Double fertilization is a unique characteristic of angiosperms. In angiosperms, two types of fertilization occur: simultaneous (or simultaneous) fertilization, where both sperm cells fuse with the egg cell, resulting in a diploid zygote, and triple fertilization, where one sperm cell fuses with the egg cell, and another sperm cell fuses with the two polar nuclei, resulting in a triploid zygote. This process is not observed in other plant groups. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Double fertilization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
