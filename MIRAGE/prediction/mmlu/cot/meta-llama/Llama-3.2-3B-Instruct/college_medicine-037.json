    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the factors that contribute to improvements in women's world record performances. Let's evaluate each option: Option A: Women have evolved a greater muscle mass. - This is unlikely to be the primary reason for improvements in world record performances. While muscle mass is an important factor in athletic performance, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that women have evolved to have greater muscle mass. Option B: Women can now run faster than men. - This option is incorrect. While women's running times have improved, men still generally hold the world records in most events. Option C: Women have started training at an earlier age. - This is a plausible reason. With the increasing participation of women in sports at a younger age, there is more time for them to develop their skills and build up their physical abilities, leading to improved performance. Option D: More women are now engaged in sport. - While this is true, it is not the primary reason for improvements in world record performances. Increased participation in sports can lead to improved overall fitness and performance, but it is not a direct cause of record-breaking performances. Based on the analysis, the most likely reason for the improvements in women's world record performances is that women have started training at an earlier age.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
