        "A": "Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.",
        "B": "Early embryos display identical features of their class, order, and species.",

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down each option in the context of embryonic development and evolutionary biology.\\n\\nOption A, 'Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,' suggests that the development of an organism from a zygote to an adult mirrors the evolutionary history of its species. While this concept was once widely accepted, it has largely been discredited due to the lack of evidence supporting this idea. Modern embryology has shown that embryonic development is highly conserved across species, but it does not directly reflect the evolutionary history of the species.\\n\\nOption B, 'Early embryos display identical features of their class, order, and species,' is not accurate. While early embryos do share some common characteristics, these features are more related to the shared ancestry of the species rather than their class or order. This option is too broad and does not accurately describe embryonic development.\\n\\nOption C, 'An early human embryo has features in common with early fish and avian embryos,' is supported by scientific evidence. Studies have shown that early human embryos exhibit similarities with those of fish and birds, such as the formation of a notochord and the development of a dorsal-ventral axis. These similarities reflect the shared ancestry of these species and are a result of convergent evolution rather than a direct recapitulation of phylogeny.\\n\\nOption D, 'A human embryo displays features of adult fish and birds in the course of its development,' is not accurate. While early human embryos do share some features with adult fish and birds, these similarities are not present in the adult stages of these species. The development of a human embryo is distinct from that of fish and birds and does not display features of the adult stages of these species.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. An early human embryo has features in common with early fish and avian embryos.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
