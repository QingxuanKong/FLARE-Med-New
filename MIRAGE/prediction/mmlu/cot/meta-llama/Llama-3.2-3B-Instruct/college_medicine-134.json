    "question": "A transmembrane protein being isolated in the laboratory is found to be composed of four different amino acids in varying quantity. They are, in order of frequency, glycine, tyrosine, arginine, and isoleucine. Of these amino acids, which is most likely to be inside the transmembrane domain?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Glycine",
        "B": "Tyrosine",
        "C": "Arginine",
        "D": "Isoleucine"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To determine which amino acid is most likely to be inside the transmembrane domain, we need to consider the characteristics of transmembrane proteins and the properties of the given amino acids. Step 1: Transmembrane proteins are typically composed of a hydrophobic core, which is often formed by non-polar amino acids. This is because the hydrophobic interactions between non-polar amino acids help to stabilize the protein's structure and prevent it from interacting with water. Step 2: Glycine (A) is the smallest and most non-polar amino acid, making it a good candidate for the hydrophobic core of a transmembrane protein. Step 3: Tyrosine (B) is a polar amino acid with a hydroxyl group, which would make it less likely to be part of the hydrophobic core. Step 4: Arginine (C) is a positively charged amino acid, which would also make it less likely to be part of the hydrophobic core. Step 5: Isoleucine (D) is a non-polar amino acid, but it is not as small as glycine, which might make it less ideal for the hydrophobic core. Considering these points, the amino acid most likely to be inside the transmembrane domain is glycine, due to its small size and non-polar nature. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Considering the characteristics of transmembrane proteins and the properties of the given amino acids, glycine is the most likely to be inside the transmembrane domain due to its small size and non-polar nature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
