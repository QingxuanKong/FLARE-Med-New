    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking: To answer this question, I'll follow the standard guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and consider the available evidence. 1. The American Heart Association (AHA) and other reputable medical organizations provide guidelines for CPR, including the recommended rate for chest compressions. 2. The AHA recommends that chest compressions be performed at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute for adults. 3. While the exact rate may vary slightly depending on the individual's condition and the specific circumstances, there is no evidence to suggest that the rate should be adjusted based on the patient's heart rate or other factors. 4. The option \"as fast as possible\" is not a specific rate and could be misleading, as it may not ensure the correct rate of compressions. 5. The option \"varies with each patient\" is also not supported by evidence, as the recommended rate is a standardized guideline for all adults. Considering these points, the most accurate answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The recommended rate for chest compressions during CPR is 100 to 120 compressions per minute, as per the American Heart Association guidelines. The correct answer is not 'as fast as possible' or 'varies with each patient', but rather a specific rate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 100/minute.\"}",
