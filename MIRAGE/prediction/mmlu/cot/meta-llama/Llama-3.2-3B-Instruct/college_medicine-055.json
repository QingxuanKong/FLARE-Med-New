    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break it down step by step. First, we need to understand the role of each option in glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle cells. A. Adrenaline (also known as epinephrine) is a hormone released by the adrenal glands in response to stress, low blood glucose, or other stimuli. Its primary function is to prepare the body for 'fight or flight' by increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and energy supplies. However, adrenaline actually promotes the breakdown of glucose and amino acids in the muscles, rather than their uptake. B. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood glucose levels. When insulin binds to its receptors on muscle cells, it triggers a signaling cascade that promotes glucose uptake by the cells through the translocation of glucose transporter proteins to the cell surface. Additionally, insulin also stimulates the uptake of amino acids by muscle cells by increasing the expression of amino acid transporters. C. Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate stored in the liver and muscles that serves as a readily mobilizable energy reserve. While glycogen breakdown (glycogenolysis) does release glucose into the bloodstream, it does not directly promote the uptake of glucose or amino acids by muscle cells. D. Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that plays a role in the body's response to stress, regulating blood sugar levels, and aiding in the metabolism of fat, protein, and carbohydrates. While cortisol can increase the breakdown of glucose and amino acids, it does not directly promote their uptake by muscle cells. Considering these functions, insulin is the correct answer because it directly promotes the uptake of glucose and amino acids by muscle cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
