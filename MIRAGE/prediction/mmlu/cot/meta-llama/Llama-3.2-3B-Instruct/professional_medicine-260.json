    "question": "A 10-year-old boy is brought for a follow-up examination 2 days after he was seen in the emergency department because of hives, hoarseness, and light-headedness. His symptoms began 15 minutes after he was stung by a bee and lasted approximately 60 minutes; they resolved before he was treated. He has been stung by bees three times over the past year, and each reaction has been more severe. Examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Avoid areas known to have bees",
        "B": "Avoid wearing colorful clothing outside",
        "C": "Carrying diphenhydramine tablets",
        "D": "Carrying self-injectable epinephrine"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction to a bee sting. The fact that the symptoms began within 15 minutes of the sting and lasted for approximately 60 minutes, and that the patient has a history of increasingly severe reactions to bee stings, indicate a high risk of future anaphylaxis. The patient's symptoms also include hives, hoarseness, and light-headedness, which are common symptoms of anaphylaxis. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that individuals with a history of anaphylaxis due to insect stings carry an epinephrine injector, such as an EpiPen, at all times. This is because anaphylaxis can occur suddenly and without warning, and prompt treatment with epinephrine can help alleviate symptoms and prevent serious complications. While avoiding areas known to have bees (A) and wearing protective clothing (B) may be helpful in preventing bee stings, they do not address the underlying risk of anaphylaxis. Taking diphenhydramine tablets (C) may provide some relief from symptoms, but it is not a substitute for epinephrine in the event of an anaphylactic reaction. Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition is to carry a self-injectable epinephrine, such as an EpiPen (D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
