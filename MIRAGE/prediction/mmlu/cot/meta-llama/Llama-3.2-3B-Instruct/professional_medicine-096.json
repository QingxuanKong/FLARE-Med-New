    "question": "A 9-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive weakness and a purple-red discoloration over his cheeks and upper eyelids over the past 8 weeks. His symptoms began shortly after a camping trip, and he now is unable to climb stairs, walk long distances, comb his hair, or dress himself. His mother says that she was careful to apply his sunscreen on the trip and can recall no tick bites or exposure to poisonous plants. His only medication is a topical corticosteroid for several dry, scaly patches of the skin. He appears weak and lethargic. He is at the 75th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight; he has had no change in his weight since his last examination 9 months ago. His temperature is 37.7\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 28/min. Examination of the skin shows a purple-red discoloration over the cheeks and eyelids, periorbital edema, erythematous plaques and scales over the elbows and knees, and flat-topped red papules over all knuckles. There is generalized weakness and atrophy of the proximal muscles. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Dermatomyositis",
        "B": "Duchenne's muscular dystrophy",
        "C": "Eczema",
        "D": "Lyme disease"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the symptoms presented and match them with the given options. The key features of the case include progressive weakness, purple-red discoloration over the cheeks and upper eyelids, periorbital edema, erythematous plaques and scales over the elbows and knees, flat-topped red papules over all knuckles, and generalized weakness and atrophy of the proximal muscles. The patient's age and the sudden onset of symptoms after a camping trip could suggest an infectious etiology, but the lack of tick bites or exposure to poisonous plants makes this less likely. The patient's weight loss and lack of growth since the last examination also point towards a chronic condition rather than an acute infection. Dermatomyositis is a condition characterized by skin and muscle inflammation, which matches the patient's symptoms of skin discoloration, muscle weakness, and muscle atrophy. The skin manifestations of dermatomyositis can include erythematous plaques and scales, and flat-topped papules, which are consistent with the patient's symptoms. Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is a chronic skin condition that can cause erythematous plaques and scales, but it does not typically cause muscle weakness or atrophy. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder that causes progressive muscle degeneration, but it does not typically cause skin manifestations like the ones described. Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection that can cause a rash and fever, but it does not typically cause the skin manifestations or muscle weakness described in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is dermatomyositis, which is a condition that affects both the skin and muscles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
