    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Understanding the terms**: - **Cleavage symmetry**: Refers to the pattern of cell divisions in early development, which can be radial, bilateral, or radial-bilateral (also known as spiral). - **Early cell divisions**: These are the first cell divisions that occur in the early stages of development. - **Oblique angle to the polar axis**: The polar axis is an imaginary line that runs through the center of the fertilized egg, dividing the egg into two equal halves. An oblique angle suggests a deviation from this axis. 2. **Analyzing the options**: - **A. Meroblastic cleavage**: This is a type of cleavage where only one side of the cell divides, resulting in unequal cell sizes. It doesn't necessarily relate to an oblique angle to the polar axis. - **B. Radial cleavage**: This type of cleavage occurs in radial symmetry, where cells divide in a radial pattern around the center of the egg. This doesn't match the description of an oblique angle to the polar axis. - **C. Spiral cleavage**: This type of cleavage occurs in radial-bilateral symmetry, where cells divide in a spiral pattern around the center of the egg. This description matches the concept of cleavage symmetry at an oblique angle to the polar axis. - **D. Superficial cleavage**: This term is not commonly used in the context of describing cleavage symmetry in early development. 3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the type of cleavage symmetry that arises from early cell divisions occurring at an oblique angle to the polar axis is spiral cleavage. ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question requires understanding the concept of cleavage symmetry and the specific conditions under which it occurs. The correct answer can be deduced by eliminating options that do not match the description. Spiral cleavage is the type of cleavage symmetry that arises from early cell divisions occurring at an oblique angle to the polar axis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ```",
