    "question": "When preparing for the MCAT exam, a student begins studying electrochemical cells. He learns the basic information needed by actively relating it to previous information he has learned about redox reactions. He then builds from that knowledge to learn the advanced concepts needed. The student\u2019s process is best characterized as:",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best characterization of the student's process, let's analyze the information provided. The student starts by relating basic information about electrochemical cells to previous knowledge about redox reactions. This indicates that the student is actively connecting new information to existing knowledge, which is a key aspect of elaborative rehearsal. Elaborative rehearsal involves building on prior knowledge to create new connections and deepen understanding. This process helps to promote long-term retention and transfer of information to new contexts. On the other hand, chunking involves breaking down information into smaller, more manageable pieces, which is not explicitly mentioned in the scenario. The network model is a concept related to how information is organized in the brain, but it doesn't directly describe the student's learning process. Maintenance rehearsal is a type of rehearsal that involves repeating information to maintain short-term memory, but it doesn't involve building new connections or relating information to previous knowledge. Therefore, the student's process is best characterized as elaborative rehearsal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
