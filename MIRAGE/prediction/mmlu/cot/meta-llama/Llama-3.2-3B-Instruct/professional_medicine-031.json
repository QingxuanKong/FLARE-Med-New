    "question": "A 32-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being struck by a car while driving his motorcycle. He reports severe pelvic pain. On examination, there is bruising of the perineum and pain is elicited with motion of his pelvis. Blood is noted at the urethral meatus. There is no other penile trauma. A plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus and retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption. Which of the following portions of the urethra would be at greatest risk for injury in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Intramural (pre-prostatic)",
        "B": "Membranous",
        "C": "Prostatic",
        "D": "Spongy"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the anatomy of the male urethra and the mechanism of injury. The patient was struck by a car while driving his motorcycle, which is a high-energy trauma mechanism that can cause significant force to be transmitted to the pelvic area. The presence of bruising of the perineum and pain with motion of the pelvis suggests a pelvic fracture, which is confirmed by the plain x-ray. The retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption. The question asks which portion of the urethra would be at greatest risk for injury in this patient. The male urethra is divided into four main parts: the prostatic, membranous, bulbous, and spongy (penile) urethra. The prostatic urethra is the part that passes through the prostate gland, while the membranous urethra is the part that passes through the urogenital diaphragm. The bulbous and spongy urethra are located in the penis. Given the mechanism of injury and the location of the pelvic fracture, the membranous urethra is at greatest risk for injury because it is the narrowest part of the male urethra and is located in the pelvic area, making it more susceptible to compression and shearing forces from the pelvic fracture. The intramural (pre-prostatic) urethra is not typically associated with pelvic fractures, the prostatic urethra is surrounded by the prostate gland which may absorb some of the force, and the spongy urethra is located in the penis and is less likely to be injured in a pelvic fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
