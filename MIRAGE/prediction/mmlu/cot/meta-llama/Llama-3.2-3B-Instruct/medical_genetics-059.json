    "question": "In humans, each cell normally contains ______ of chromosomes.",
    "options": {
        "A": "11 pairs",
        "B": "23 pairs",
        "C": "32 pairs",
        "D": "46 pairs"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking: In humans, cells are eukaryotic, and eukaryotic cells have a specific number of chromosomes that are unique to our species. 1. Humans are diploid organisms, meaning we have two sets of chromosomes in each cell. 2. Each set of chromosomes is made up of two identical copies of each chromosome. 3. There are 23 pairs of chromosomes in humans, with a total of 46 chromosomes. So, considering the options provided: - Option A (11 pairs) is incorrect because it's too low for humans. - Option B (23 pairs) is partially correct, as there are 23 pairs, but it doesn't account for the second set of chromosomes. - Option C (32 pairs) is incorrect because it's higher than the actual number of pairs. - Option D (46 pairs) is the correct answer, as it represents the total number of chromosomes in a human cell, with 23 pairs of chromosomes. Here's the output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Humans are diploid organisms with two sets of chromosomes, each made up of 23 pairs, resulting in a total of 46 chromosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
