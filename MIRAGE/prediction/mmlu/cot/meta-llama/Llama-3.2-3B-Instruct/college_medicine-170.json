    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the false statement, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is indeed the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis. It catalyzes the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, a key step in glycolysis. So, option A is true. 2. Phosphorylase activity is actually higher in Type I fibres than in Type II fibres. Phosphofructokinase is the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, and it is more active in Type I fibres, which are slow-twitch fibres that rely more on anaerobic metabolism. Type II fibres, on the other hand, are fast-twitch fibres that rely more on oxidative phosphorylation. So, option B is false. 3. Endurance training can increase the amount of TCA cycle enzymes in muscle, as the body adapts to increased oxidative metabolism. So, option C is true. 4. Oxygen is consumed during the TCA cycle, as it is a key step in oxidative phosphorylation. So, option D is true. Therefore, the false statement is option B: Phosphorylase activity is higher in Type II fibres than in Type I fibres.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
