    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The World Systems Theory, also known as World-Systems Theory, is a framework used to understand the global economic and political relationships between countries. It was developed by Immanuel Wallerstein and others. The theory categorizes countries into three main subcategories: core countries, periphery countries, and semi-periphery countries. To determine which option correlates best with semi-periphery countries, let's analyze each choice.\\n\\nA. Strong central government: Core countries typically have strong central governments that exert significant control over their economies and societies. This is not a characteristic of semi-periphery countries, which often have weaker and less centralized governments.\\n\\nB. An economy centralized around one natural resource: Semi-periphery countries often have economies that are heavily dependent on a single natural resource, such as oil or agriculture. This is a common feature of semi-periphery countries, as they often lack the economic diversification and industrialization of core countries.\\n\\nC. A diversified and developed economy: Semi-periphery countries typically have economies that are less developed and less diversified compared to core countries. They often rely heavily on primary commodities and lack the advanced manufacturing and services sectors found in core countries.\\n\\nD. Small percentage of very high class individuals: While it is true that some semi-periphery countries have a small percentage of wealthy individuals, this is not a defining characteristic of semi-periphery countries. In fact, many semi-periphery countries have a significant underclass and poverty.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the option that correlates best with semi-periphery countries is B. An economy centralized around one natural resource.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
