    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. **Cystic fibrosis (A)**: Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. While enzyme assays can be used to diagnose cystic fibrosis by measuring the levels of sweat chloride, they are not typically used to identify carriers. Carriers of cystic fibrosis are usually asymptomatic and do not require enzyme assays for identification. 2. **Fragile X syndrome (B)**: Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the FMR1 gene. Enzyme assays are not typically used to identify carriers of fragile X syndrome. Instead, genetic testing, such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), is used to diagnose and identify carriers. 3. **Oculocutaneous albinism (C)**: Oculocutaneous albinism is a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the production of melanin, leading to skin, hair, and eye abnormalities. Enzyme assays can be used to diagnose and identify carriers of some forms of oculocutaneous albinism, such as tyrosinase deficiency. For example, tyrosinase is an enzyme involved in the production of melanin, and its activity can be measured to diagnose and identify carriers of certain forms of oculocutaneous albinism. 4. **Tay-Sachs disease (D)**: Tay-Sachs disease is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the HEXA gene. Enzyme assays, specifically hexosaminidase A activity, can be used to diagnose Tay-Sachs disease and identify carriers. This is because the HEXA gene codes for the enzyme hexosaminidase A, which is deficient in individuals with Tay-Sachs disease. Measuring hexosaminidase A activity can help diagnose and identify carriers. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzyme assays can be used to identify carriers of Tay-Sachs disease by measuring hexosaminidase A activity, while enzyme assays are not typically used for the other options. Tay-Sachs disease is the only option among the four choices where enzyme assays are directly related to carrier identification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
