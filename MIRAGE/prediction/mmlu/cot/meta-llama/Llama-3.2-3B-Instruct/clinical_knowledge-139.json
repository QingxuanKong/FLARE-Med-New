    "predict": "To determine the 'normal' range of flexion at the knee joint, let's break down the process step-by-step: 1. **Understanding Flexion**: Flexion refers to the bending movement of a joint, in this case, the knee joint. The range of motion at the knee joint is typically measured in degrees. 2. **Normal Range of Motion**: The normal range of motion for the knee joint is generally considered to be between 0 degrees (full extension) and 135 degrees (full flexion). This range allows for a wide range of activities, including walking, running, and squatting. 3. **Eliminating Options**: - Option A (0-115 degrees) is too limited, as it does not account for the full range of motion. - Option C (0-155 degrees) and Option D (0-175 degrees) are too wide, as they extend beyond the commonly accepted normal range. 4. **Selecting the Best Answer**: - Based on the understanding of the normal range of motion at the knee joint, the best answer is Option B (0-135 degrees), as it accurately represents the accepted normal range of flexion. Here's the final answer in the requested format: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the 'normal' range of flexion at the knee joint, the normal range is generally considered to be between 0 degrees (full extension) and 135 degrees (full flexion).
