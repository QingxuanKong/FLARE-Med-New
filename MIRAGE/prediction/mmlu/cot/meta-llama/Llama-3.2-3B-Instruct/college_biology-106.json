    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option given about embryonic cleavage.\\n\\nOption A: The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage. - This statement is true. In animals with yolk, the yolk serves as a nutrient source, and its presence can inhibit the rapid cell divisions required for cleavage to occur.\\n\\nOption B: Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage. - This statement is true. Telolecithal eggs, which have a small amount of yolk, undergo meroblastic cleavage, where the yolk is utilized during the cleavage process.\\n\\nOption C: The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than does the animal pole - This statement is true. In cleavage, the vegetal pole tends to undergo more rapid and complete divisions compared to the animal pole, which undergoes incomplete and slower divisions.\\n\\nOption D: The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres. - This statement is false. The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage give rise to a series of zygote, which then undergoes further divisions to form a blastula. The blastomeres are the cells produced during the cleavage process, but they are not the final product of these rapid divisions. Instead, they undergo further divisions to form the blastula and eventually the blastocyst.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
