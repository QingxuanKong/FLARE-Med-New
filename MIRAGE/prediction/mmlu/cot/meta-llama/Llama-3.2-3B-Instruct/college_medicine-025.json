    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Point Mutation:** A point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence. In this case, we need to identify which option has a different nucleotide at a specific position. The original sequence is 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATCCTCATG \u2013 3\u2019. 2. **Deletion:** A deletion is the loss of a nucleotide or a segment of DNA. We need to find the option that has a shorter sequence than the original. Let's analyze the options: - A. 5\u2019 \u2013 GCATCCTCATG \u2013 3\u2019: This option has a deletion of the 'G' at the beginning of the sequence, but it's still a point mutation at the 'G' position, not a deletion of the entire 'G' nucleotide. - B. 5\u2019 \u2013 TGATCCCAG \u2013 3\u2019: This option has a point mutation at the 'G' position, which is the same as the original sequence. However, it has a deletion of the 'G' at the end. - C. 5\u2019 \u2013 GGTCCTCATC \u2013 3\u2019: This option has a point mutation at the 'A' position, but it's not a deletion. - D. 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATCCATG \u2013 3\u2019: This option has a point mutation at the 'T' position, but it's not a deletion. Considering both the point mutation and the deletion, option B (5\u2019 \u2013 TGATCCCAG \u2013 3\u2019) is the correct answer. It has a point mutation at the 'G' position and a deletion of the 'G' at the end. Here's the output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we analyzed each option and found that option B has a point mutation at the 'G' position and a deletion of the 'G' at the end. This matches the description of the original sequence experiencing both a point mutation and a deletion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
