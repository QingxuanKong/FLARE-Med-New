    "question": "A 32-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 41 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. Pregnancy has been complicated by mild asthma treated with inhaled bronchodilators. At the beginning of the second stage of labor, the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -1 station. The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations. After 10 minutes of pushing, there is a prolonged deceleration to 60/min. The patient has the acute onset of shortness of breath, rapidly develops cyanosis, and becomes unresponsive. Her pulse and blood pressure cannot be detected. Immediate resuscitation is started. Five minutes later, there is bleeding from the nose, mouth, and intravenous sites. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Amniotic fluid embolism",
        "B": "Intracerebral hemorrhage",
        "C": "Myocardial infarction",
        "D": "Status asmaticus"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the scenario provided: 1. The patient is in active labor with a history of mild asthma, which is being managed with inhaled bronchodilators. 2. The patient's vital signs are stable at the beginning of the second stage of labor, with a reactive fetal heart rate and no decelerations. 3. After 10 minutes of pushing, there is a sudden onset of shortness of breath, cyanosis, and unresponsiveness, followed by an unresponsive patient. 4. The patient's pulse and blood pressure cannot be detected, indicating a severe cardiovascular collapse. 5. Five minutes later, there is bleeding from the nose, mouth, and intravenous sites. Given these points, the most likely diagnosis can be deduced as follows: - The sudden onset of cyanosis and unresponsiveness in a patient with asthma suggests a severe respiratory complication. - The inability to detect pulse and blood pressure indicates cardiovascular collapse, which can be due to several causes, but given the context, it is more likely related to the respiratory issue. - The presence of bleeding from multiple sites, including the nose, mouth, and intravenous sites, is a critical clue that points towards a specific diagnosis. Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is an amniotic fluid embolism (AFE). AFE is a rare but life-threatening condition that occurs when amniotic fluid enters the mother's bloodstream, triggering a severe allergic reaction and triggering anaphylaxis. This condition can cause respiratory failure, cardiovascular collapse, and even death. The presence of bleeding from multiple sites and the sudden onset of cyanosis and unresponsiveness in a patient with asthma further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is A. Amniotic fluid embolism.\"}",
