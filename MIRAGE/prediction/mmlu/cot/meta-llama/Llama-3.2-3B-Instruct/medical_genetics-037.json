    "options": {
        "A": "is present in only one form in an individual",
        "B": "substitutes one body part for another in development",
        "C": "results in development of a tumor",
        "D": "is wild type at one temperature and abnormal at another"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking: To answer this question, let's break down the concept of a homeotic mutation: 1. **Understanding the term \"homeotic\"**: The term \"homeotic\" comes from the Greek words \"homos\" meaning \"same\" and \"eikos\" meaning \"form\". In the context of biology, homeotic refers to a type of mutation that affects the development of an organism, specifically the formation of body parts. 2. **Defining homeotic mutations**: Homeotic mutations are genetic changes that alter the development of an organism by substituting one body part for another. This can result in the formation of abnormal or missing body parts. 3. **Analyzing the options**: - Option A: \"is present in only one form in an individual\" - This option describes a condition known as a \"fixed trait\" or \"allelic heterozygote\", but it doesn't relate to the definition of homeotic mutations. - Option B: \"substitutes one body part for another in development\" - This directly matches the definition of homeotic mutations. - Option C: \"results in development of a tumor\" - This describes a different type of genetic mutation known as oncogenesis, which is not related to homeotic mutations. - Option D: \"is wild type at one temperature and abnormal at another\" - This option describes a phenomenon related to temperature-sensitive mutations, which is not relevant to homeotic mutations. 4. **Conclusion**: Based on the definition and analysis, the correct answer is the option that directly describes the effect of homeotic mutations on development.
