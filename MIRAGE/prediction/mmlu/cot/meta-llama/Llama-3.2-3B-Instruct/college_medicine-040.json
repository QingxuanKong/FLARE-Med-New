    "question": "A teacher sets up a reward system for her elementary school students. At the end of each day, she gives a sticker to each student who showed up on time that morning. At the end of each week, she gives a sticker to any student who got above a 90% on three quizzes in a row. After months of this regimen, she finds that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but that tardiness has only decreased slightly. Which of the following best explains the teacher\u2019s observation?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.",
        "B": "The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.",
        "C": "The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.",
        "D": "The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's analyze the situation step by step: 1. **Understanding the reward system**: The teacher sets up a reward system where students receive a sticker for showing up on time and another sticker for achieving a 90% or higher on three consecutive quizzes. This implies a two-part reinforcement schedule: a fixed ratio (1 sticker for punctuality) and a variable ratio (3 stickers for achieving a certain performance level on quizzes). 2. **Analyzing the behavior change**: The teacher observes that performance on quizzes has increased significantly, while tardiness has only decreased slightly. This suggests that the behavior change is stronger in response to the variable ratio (quiz performance) than to the fixed ratio (punctuality). 3. **Understanding the schedules**: - **Variable Ratio (VR) schedules** are characterized by an unpredictable number of responses before a reinforcement. This type of schedule is known to create strong responses and behavior that is resistant to extinction. - **Fixed Ratio (FR) schedules** are characterized by a fixed number of responses before a reinforcement. This type of schedule can lead to stronger responses initially but may also lead to extinction as the behavior becomes predictable. - **Fixed Interval (FI) schedules** are not mentioned in the question, but we can infer that the variable ratio schedule is similar to a fixed interval schedule, where the reinforcement occurs at a fixed time interval. 4. **Analyzing the options**: - A. Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction. This is consistent with the observation that quiz performance increased significantly, while tardiness decreased slightly. - B. This option is incorrect because the data does not suggest that students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time. - C. This option is incorrect because the data does not suggest that the behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than to a variable-interval schedule. - D. This option is incorrect because the data does not suggest that the behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than to a variable-interval schedule. Therefore, the answer is: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The teacher's observation is best explained by option A, as the variable ratio schedule (quiz performance) created the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"} ```",
