    "question": "A 29-year-old Hispanic woman, gravida 3, para 3, comes to the office because of recurrent low back pain during the past year. Rest and analgesics usually eradicate the pain within 2 weeks. However, the pain seems to recur every 2 to 3 months. Medical history is remarkable for gestational diabetes mellitus during her pregnancies. She takes no medications except for an oral contraceptive. She walks 3 miles daily for exercise and works as a sales representative for a computer software company. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 37 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal, and physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Administer an epidural injection of methylprednisolone",
        "B": "Order MRI of the lumbosacral spine",
        "C": "Order x-rays of the lumbosacral spine",
        "D": "Recommend beginning a weight loss program"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with recurrent low back pain that is exacerbated by her occupation and worsened by her BMI. She has a history of gestational diabetes mellitus, which may increase her risk for musculoskeletal problems. Given the patient's age, occupation, and BMI, it is likely that her low back pain is related to mechanical factors rather than a serious underlying pathology. The fact that rest and analgesics usually eradicate the pain within 2 weeks suggests that the pain is likely musculoskeletal in nature. The patient's normal vital signs and physical examination do not suggest any acute or chronic inflammatory processes. Considering these factors, the most appropriate next step would be to address the patient's weight loss, as it is a modifiable risk factor for low back pain and may also improve her overall health. The other options, such as ordering imaging studies or an epidural injection, may not be immediately necessary and could be considered if the pain persists or worsens despite weight loss efforts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
