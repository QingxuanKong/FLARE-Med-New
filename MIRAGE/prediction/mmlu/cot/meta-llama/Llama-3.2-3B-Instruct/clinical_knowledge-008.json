    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down the concept of codons and their composition. Codons are sequences of nucleotide bases found in DNA or RNA. They play a crucial role in the process of translation, where they serve as the genetic code for amino acids. The genetic code is based on the sequence of nucleotides in a codon, not amino acids or sugars. Now, let's evaluate the options provided.\\n\\nOption A: triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA. This option aligns with the definition of codons, which are indeed composed of triplet sequences of nucleotide bases. This is the correct answer.\\n\\nOption B: quadruplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA. This option is incorrect because codons are composed of triplet sequences, not quadruplet sequences.\\n\\nOption C: triplet sequences of amino acids in polypeptide chains. This option is also incorrect because codons are composed of nucleotide bases, not amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and they are linked together by peptide bonds in polypeptide chains.\\n\\nOption D: triplet sequences of deoxyribose sugars in DNA. This option is incorrect because codons are composed of nucleotide bases, not deoxyribose sugars. Nucleotide bases are the components of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA and RNA.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
