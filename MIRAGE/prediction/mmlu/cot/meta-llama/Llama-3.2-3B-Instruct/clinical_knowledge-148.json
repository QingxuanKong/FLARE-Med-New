    "options": {
        "A": "It causes stridor due to compression of the oesophagus",
        "B": "Dysphagia is an indication for surgery",
        "C": "It causes hoarseness due to compression of the trachea",
        "D": "It causes a more florid thyrotoxicosis than a smaller goitre"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's consider the potential complications of a large goitre and the effects it can have on surrounding structures. A large goitre can compress nearby structures, leading to various symptoms. The trachea is located close to the thyroid gland, and compression can affect the airway. The oesophagus is also nearby, but it's not as directly affected by a large goitre. Hoarseness is more commonly associated with compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is more likely to be affected by a large goitre. Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, can occur due to compression of the oesophagus, but it's not the most direct consequence of a large goitre. Thyrotoxicosis is a condition related to excessive thyroid hormone production, and its severity is not directly correlated with the size of the goitre. A large goitre can lead to an increased risk of thyroid storm, a life-threatening complication of untreated hyperthyroidism, but this is not listed as an option. Considering these factors, we can evaluate the options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
