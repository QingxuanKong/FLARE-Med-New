    "options": {
        "A": "Abduction",
        "B": "Eversion",
        "C": "Flexion",
        "D": "Pronation"

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option given: 1. Abduction refers to the movement of a limb away from the midline of the body. This doesn't describe bending the forearm toward the body, so we can eliminate option A. 2. Eversion refers to the movement of the sole of the foot away from the midline of the body or the movement of a limb away from the midline of the body in a way that it rotates outward. This doesn't describe bending the forearm toward the body, so we can eliminate option B. 3. Flexion is a movement where a limb is bent toward the midline of the body. This sounds like the movement described in the question, bending the forearm toward the body. 4. Pronation refers to the movement where the forearm is rotated so the palm faces downward. This is a rotation and not a bending movement, so we can eliminate option D. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Flexion.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
