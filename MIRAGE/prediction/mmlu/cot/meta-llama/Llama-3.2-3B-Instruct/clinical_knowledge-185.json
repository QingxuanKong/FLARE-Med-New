    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the basic structure of human cells. Human cells are eukaryotic cells, which have a nucleus and other organelles. Somatic cells are a type of eukaryotic cell that make up the majority of the body's cells, excluding reproductive cells (gametes). The number of chromosomes in human somatic cells is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes in the cell. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes. This is a fundamental concept in genetics and is essential for understanding human development and disease. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and B, which are too low. Option C is the correct number of chromosomes in human somatic cells, as it represents half the total number of chromosomes in a human cell, which is 46.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
