    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the normal heart rate for an adult at rest, we need to consider the typical range for a healthy adult. A normal heart rate can vary depending on factors such as age, fitness level, and overall health. However, according to the American Heart Association, the normal heart rate range for an adult at rest is generally considered to be between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm). This range is based on the average resting heart rate for adults, which can be influenced by various factors such as age, sex, and physical fitness level. The American Heart Association also notes that a resting heart rate of 60-100 bpm is a normal range for adults, with an average of around 70-80 bpm for healthy adults. Therefore, considering these general guidelines, the correct answer is the option that falls within this range.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
