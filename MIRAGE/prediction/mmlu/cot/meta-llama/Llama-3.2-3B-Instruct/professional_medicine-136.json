    "question": "A 34-year-old white woman comes to the emergency department because of a persistent dull headache for the past 3 days. She has been taking acetaminophen without relief. She says, \"I haven't slept in 3 days and I am having trouble focusing at work.\" There is no history of trauma and she takes no medications. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 14 years but does not drink alcoholic beverages. Vital signs are temperature 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse 86/min, respirations 19/min, and blood pressure 182/100 mm Hg. Examination of the head shows no abnormalities. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light; there is mild photophobia. Funduscopic examination is normal. A serous effusion is noted on examination of the left tympanic membrane. Neck is stiff with painful flexion; when the patient's neck is flexed forward, she reports and electric shock sensation. Mild expiratory wheezes are heard on auscultation of the chest. A midsystolic click is heard best at the left sternal border; there are no murmurs or gallops. Abdominal examination shows striae, but is otherwise noncontributory. Examination of the lower extremities shows varicosities bilaterally and 1+ edema; muscle strength is 4/5. Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following physical findings is most indicative of the need for immediate further evaluation?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Abdominal striae",
        "B": "Expiratory wheezes",
        "C": "Midsystolic click",
        "D": "Neck stiffness"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key findings from the patient's presentation and physical examination. The patient presents with a persistent dull headache, insomnia, and difficulty focusing, which are non-specific symptoms. However, the presence of a serous effusion on the left tympanic membrane and mild photophobia suggest a possible inner ear issue. The patient's neck stiffness, especially with an electric shock sensation when flexing the neck, is a red flag symptom for Cushing's syndrome or other endocrine disorders. The presence of abdominal striae is also a classic finding in Cushing's syndrome. The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 182/100 mmHg, which is a significant finding. The midsystolic click heard at the left sternal border is often associated with mitral valve prolapse, but in the context of Cushing's syndrome, it could be a false positive finding. The expiratory wheezes and varicosities bilaterally are non-specific findings that could be seen in various conditions. Considering the combination of elevated blood pressure, abdominal striae, and neck stiffness with an electric shock sensation, the most concerning finding that warrants immediate further evaluation is the abdominal striae. This finding, in conjunction with the patient's hypertension and other symptoms, raises a high suspicion for Cushing's syndrome, which can be life-threatening if left untreated. Therefore, further evaluation, such as a 24-hour urine free cortisol level, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Hence, the correct answer is A. Abdominal striae.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
