    "question": "Which of the following releases most energy when completely oxidised in the body?",
    "options": {
        "A": "One gram of glucose",
        "B": "One gram of palmitic acid",
        "C": "One gram of leucine",
        "D": "One gram of alcohol"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To solve this, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. **Understanding Oxidation**: Oxidation is a chemical reaction that involves the loss of electrons. In the context of metabolism, it refers to the breakdown of substances to produce energy. 2. **Energy Yield from Different Substances**: - **Glucose (A)**: Glucose is a simple sugar that serves as a primary source of energy for cells. When completely oxidized, it produces 36.7 kilocalories (kcal) of energy per gram. - **Palmitic Acid (B)**: Palmitic acid is a fatty acid found in fats. When it undergoes complete oxidation, it produces 9 kcal of energy per gram. - **Leucine (C)**: Leucine is an essential amino acid. While it plays a role in protein synthesis and can be catabolized for energy, its complete oxidation yields approximately 5 kcal of energy per gram. - **Alcohol (D)**: Ethanol (alcohol) is completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, producing 7.4 kcal of energy per gram. 3. **Comparing Energy Yield**: - Glucose yields 36.7 kcal/g - Palmitic acid yields 9 kcal/g - Leucine yields 5 kcal/g - Alcohol yields 7.4 kcal/g 4. **Conclusion**: The substance that releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body is glucose, as it yields the highest amount of energy per gram. **Answer Choice**: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which substance releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body, we need to consider the energy yield from each option. Glucose yields 36.7 kcal/g, palmitic acid yields 9 kcal/g, leucine yields 5 kcal/g, and alcohol yields 7.4 kcal/g. Therefore, the substance that releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body is glucose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" } ```",
