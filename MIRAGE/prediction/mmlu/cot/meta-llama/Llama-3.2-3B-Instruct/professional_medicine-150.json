    "question": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a physical examination prior to participating in sports. He appears reluctant to remove his shirt for the examination, and says that he is embarrassed because he has grown breasts during the past year. He is at the 50th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows bilateral 1.5-cm fibroglandular masses located beneath the nipple-areolar complex and normal penis and testes. Pubic hair development is Tanner stage 3. Serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's breast enlargement?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor",
        "B": "Peutz-Jeghers syndrome",
        "C": "Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome)",
        "D": "Normal development"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. The patient is a 14-year-old boy who has noticed breast enlargement, which is a common concern for adolescent boys. 2. Physical examination reveals bilateral 1.5-cm fibroglandular masses located beneath the nipple-areolar complex, which suggests gynecomastia. 3. The patient's height and weight are at the 50th percentile, and pubic hair development is Tanner stage 3, indicating normal pubertal development. 4. Serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within the reference ranges, which suggests that the patient's hormonal balance is normal. Given these points, the most likely cause of the patient's breast enlargement can be evaluated as follows: - Option A (Estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor) is unlikely because Leydig cell tumors are rare and would typically present with elevated testosterone levels, which is not the case here. - Option B (Peutz-Jeghers syndrome) is a genetic disorder that increases the risk of certain cancers, but it is not directly related to breast enlargement in this context. - Option C (Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis, or Klinefelter syndrome) is a genetic condition characterized by hypogonadism, which would likely result in low testosterone levels and other symptoms, not breast enlargement. - Option D (Normal development) is the most likely explanation, as the patient's hormonal balance is normal, and breast enlargement during puberty is a common, benign phenomenon in adolescent boys. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's breast enlargement is normal development, as it is a common and usually benign condition in adolescent boys.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
