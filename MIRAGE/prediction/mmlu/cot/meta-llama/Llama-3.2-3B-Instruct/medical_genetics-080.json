    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which diagnostic technique is of no value for the diagnosis of neural tube defects, let's evaluate each option: 1. Amniocentesis: This is a prenatal test in which a sample of amniotic fluid is withdrawn from the uterus. It can detect neural tube defects, such as spina bifida and anencephaly, by analyzing the fluid for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and other substances. So, amniocentesis is a useful technique for diagnosing neural tube defects. 2. Chorion villus sampling (CVS): This test involves removing a small sample of placental tissue to analyze for genetic disorders, including neural tube defects. CVS can detect some neural tube defects, such as spina bifida and anencephaly, by analyzing the DNA of the placental tissue. Therefore, CVS is also a useful technique for diagnosing neural tube defects. 3. Maternal serum screening: This involves measuring the levels of AFP and other substances in the mother's blood to screen for neural tube defects. While this test can indicate an increased risk, it is not a definitive diagnostic tool for neural tube defects. It can provide a probability of the presence of a neural tube defect but cannot confirm the diagnosis. 4. Ultrasonography: This imaging technique uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of the fetus. It can detect some neural tube defects, such as spina bifida and anencephaly, by visualizing the abnormal development of the spine and skull. However, it may not detect all types of neural tube defects, especially those that are not visible on the surface. Nevertheless, ultrasonography is a valuable tool for detecting neural tube defects. Considering the above information, maternal serum screening (C) is the diagnostic technique that is of no value for the diagnosis of neural tube defects, as it can only provide a probability of the presence of a neural tube defect and not a definitive diagnosis.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
