    "question": "A species of goose nests on both cliffs and beaches near the ocean. Soon after hatching, all chicks must make their way to the ocean. Chicks from cliff nests must tumble down the cliff to get to the ocean, and many are killed by the fall. Which of the following is most consistent with the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive in this goose species?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Many more geese nest on the beaches than on the cliffs.",
        "B": "Cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than does beach nesting.",
        "C": "Chicks from cliff nests instinctively step off the cliffs at the appropriate time.",
        "D": "More chicks survive the fall from the cliffs than are killed."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's analyze the situation step by step: 1. **Understanding the scenario**: The question describes a scenario where a species of goose has two nesting options: cliffs and beaches near the ocean. Chicks from cliff nests must tumble down the cliff to reach the ocean, which results in many deaths. 2. **Identifying the hypothesis**: The hypothesis in question is that cliff nesting is adaptive for this goose species. This means we're looking for evidence that suggests cliff nesting is beneficial or advantageous for the survival and fitness of the chicks. 3. **Analyzing the options**: - A: This option suggests that more geese nest on beaches than on cliffs, but it doesn't directly address the hypothesis about the adaptiveness of cliff nesting. - B: This option states that cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than beach nesting. This could be a possible outcome of the hypothesis if cliff nesting is beneficial, but we need more information to confirm. - C: This option suggests that chicks from cliff nests instinctively step off the cliffs at the appropriate time. This could be a mechanism that might be necessary for the chicks to reach the ocean, but it doesn't directly imply that cliff nesting is beneficial. - D: This option states that more chicks survive the fall from the cliffs than are killed. This directly addresses the issue of mortality rates associated with cliff nesting. 4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most consistent evidence for the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive would be if more chicks survive the fall from the cliffs than are killed. This option (D) directly addresses the mortality issue and implies that, despite the high mortality rate, the number of surviving chicks is sufficient to outweigh the costs, suggesting that cliff nesting is beneficial. Therefore, the answer is: ``` {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Analyzing the scenario, identifying the hypothesis, and evaluating the options reveals that option D is the most consistent with the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive in this goose species. This is because it directly addresses the mortality issue and implies that the benefits of cliff nesting outweigh the costs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"} ```",
