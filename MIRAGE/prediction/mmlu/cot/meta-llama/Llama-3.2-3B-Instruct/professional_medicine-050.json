    "question": "A 47-year-old man is admitted to the hospital through the emergency department because of the sudden onset of palpitations, left-sided chest pain, light-headedness, and shortness of breath that began while he was watching television 2 hours ago. Medical history is remarkable for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 82 kg (180 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . ECG obtained in the emergency department showed atrial fibrillation with narrow QRS complex. Pulse was 146/min. Physical examination was remarkable for rapid heart rate. The patient was given oxygen via nasal cannula and intravenous metoprolol 5 mg every 5 minutes for a total of 15 mg. His pulse slowed to 90/min. Two hours after admission, he is pain free but his pulse is now 160/min. Blood pressure is 122/78 mm Hg. In order to decrease the patient's pulse, which of the following should be administered intravenously?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Digoxin",
        "B": "Enalapril",
        "C": "Lidocaine",
        "D": "Metoprolol"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To decrease the patient's pulse, we need to consider the underlying cause of the rapid heart rate. The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and has already been treated with metoprolol, which is a beta-blocker that can help slow down the heart rate. However, the patient's heart rate has increased again, indicating that the initial treatment may not be effective or that there is another underlying cause of the rapid heart rate. The patient's symptoms of palpitations, left-sided chest pain, light-headedness, and shortness of breath are consistent with a tachyarrhythmia, which is a rapid heart rate that can be life-threatening. The narrow QRS complex on the ECG suggests that the arrhythmia is likely a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Given that the patient has already been treated with metoprolol and the heart rate has increased again, we need to consider alternative options to decrease the heart rate. Digoxin (A) is a digitalis glycoside that can be used to control the heart rate in atrial fibrillation, but it may not be the best choice in this case since the patient's heart rate is primarily supraventricular. Enalapril (B) is an ACE inhibitor that can be used to treat hypertension, but it is not typically used to treat tachyarrhythmias. Lidocaine (C) is a class Ib antiarrhythmic agent that can be used to treat ventricular arrhythmias, but it is not typically used to treat supraventricular tachycardias. Metoprolol (D) is a beta-blocker that is already being used to treat the patient's atrial fibrillation, and it has been effective in slowing down the heart rate in the past. However, the patient's heart rate has increased again, indicating that the initial treatment may not be effective or that there is another underlying cause of the rapid heart rate. Therefore, we need to consider alternative options to decrease the heart rate. Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most appropriate option to decrease the patient's pulse would be to administer another beta-blocker, such as esmolol or atenolol, but since esmolol is not an option, the next best choice would be to administer another beta-blocker that has a faster onset of action, such as propranolol or nadolol, but since they are not options, we will go with metoprolol as the closest option available in the list, although it may not be the best choice in this case. However, since metoprolol is the only option available, it would be the best choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}}",
