    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. **Option A: Hyperpolarization at the end of an action potential is one mechanism by which neurons limit the rate at which action potentials may fire.** - Hyperpolarization is a state where the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. - At the end of an action potential, the neuron hyperpolarizes due to the closure of sodium channels and the opening of potassium channels. This hyperpolarization acts as a \"refractory period\" that prevents the neuron from firing another action potential for a short time. So, this statement is true. 2. **Option B: The flow of sodium into the neuron depolarizes the membrane in the first phase of an action potential.** - During the first phase of an action potential, voltage-gated sodium channels open, allowing sodium ions to rush into the cell, which causes a rapid depolarization of the membrane. This is true. 3. **Option C: The transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites.** - Neurotransmitters are typically released from the axon terminals (not dendrites) of the transmitting neuron into the synaptic cleft, where they bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. So, this statement is false. 4. **Option D: An action potential is initiated when the axon hillock reaches the threshold potential.** - An action potential is typically initiated when the axon hillock reaches the threshold potential, which is a critical point where the membrane potential becomes positive enough to trigger an action potential. This statement is true. Given the analysis, the correct answer is: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Option C is the only statement that is false. The transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its axon terminals, not dendrites.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ```",
