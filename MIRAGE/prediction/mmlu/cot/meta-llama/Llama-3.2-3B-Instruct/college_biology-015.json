    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, let's break down the events described and analyze each option: 1. A rise in intracellular free calcium in the sea urchin oocyte triggers a response to prevent polyspermy, which is the fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm. 2. The release of proteolytic enzymes is a key event in this response. 3. Now, let's examine each option: - A. Zona reaction: This is a response to sperm penetration of the zona pellucida, which is not directly related to the rise in intracellular calcium in the oocyte. - B. Acrosomal reaction: This is a response to sperm penetration of the zona pellucida by the acrosome, which is not directly related to the rise in intracellular calcium in the oocyte. - C. Cortical reaction: This is a response to a rise in intracellular calcium in the oocyte, which triggers the release of proteolytic enzymes to prevent polyspermy. - D. Fertilization reaction: This is a broader term that encompasses the entire process of fertilization, which is not specific to the events described. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is the option that directly relates to the rise in intracellular calcium in the oocyte and the release of proteolytic enzymes to prevent polyspermy.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
