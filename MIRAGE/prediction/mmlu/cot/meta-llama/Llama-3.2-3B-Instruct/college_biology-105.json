    "question": "All of the following environmental conditions increase the rate of transpiration from plants EXCEPT",
    "options": {
        "A": "high temperature",
        "B": "high relative humidity",
        "C": "low relative humidity",
        "D": "wind"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. **High temperature**: When the temperature increases, the rate of transpiration in plants also increases. This is because higher temperatures provide more energy for the plant to transport water through the plant. Therefore, high temperature is a factor that increases the rate of transpiration. 2. **High relative humidity**: High relative humidity means that the air is already saturated with water vapor. As a result, plants do not lose much water through transpiration, as the air is already full of moisture. This reduces the driving force for water loss through transpiration, so high relative humidity actually decreases the rate of transpiration. 3. **Low relative humidity**: Low relative humidity means that the air is not saturated with water vapor. This creates a greater concentration gradient, encouraging plants to lose more water through transpiration to reach equilibrium. Therefore, low relative humidity increases the rate of transpiration. 4. **Wind**: Wind can increase the rate of transpiration by increasing the rate of evaporation from the plant's surface, as the wind helps to remove the boundary layer of water from the plant's leaves. This results in a greater rate of transpiration. From the analysis above, we can conclude that high relative humidity is the condition that does not increase the rate of transpiration from plants.
