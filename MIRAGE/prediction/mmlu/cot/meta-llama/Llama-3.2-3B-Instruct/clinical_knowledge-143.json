Phlebitis is inflammation of a vein, typically characterized by pain, swelling, redness, and warmth at the site of the inflamed vein. The options provided are all potential signs of inflammation, but one of them is not typically associated with phlebitis. Let's analyze each option: A. Swelling - Swelling is a common sign of phlebitis, as it indicates fluid accumulation in the affected vein. B. Redness - Redness is also a common sign of phlebitis, as the inflamed vein becomes more visible and noticeable due to increased blood flow and inflammation. C. Exudate - Exudate, which is a thick, yellowish fluid, can be seen in phlebitis, especially if the inflammation has progressed to a more severe stage. D. Cool to the touch - Typically, phlebitis is characterized by warmth or redness, not coolness. Phlebitis is usually accompanied by heat, swelling, and pain due to inflammation, not coolness. This makes option D the correct answer as it is NOT a sign of phlebitis. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Cool to the touch.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
