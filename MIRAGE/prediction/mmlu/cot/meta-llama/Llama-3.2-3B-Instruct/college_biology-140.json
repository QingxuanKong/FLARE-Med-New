    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option in the context of fungal cell walls.\\n\\nFirst, we need to understand the composition of fungal cell walls. Fungal cell walls are primarily made of chitin, a polysaccharide that provides structural support and protection to the cell.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nOption A: Chitin - As mentioned earlier, chitin is a primary component of fungal cell walls, making it a strong candidate for the correct answer.\\n\\nOption B: Silica - While silica is a common component of some fungal structures, such as the cell walls of some lichens, it is not a primary component of fungal cell walls.\\n\\nOption C: Lignin - Lignin is a complex organic polymer found in plant cell walls, not fungal cell walls.\\n\\nOption D: Collagen fibers - Collagen fibers are a component of animal connective tissue, not fungal cell walls.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is A. Chitin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
