    "question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. He was delivered at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. His birth weight was 3500 g (7 lb 11 oz), and Apgar scores were 8 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. At the age of 15 months, physical examination showed no abnormalities, but he was not yet talking. Both of his parents had learning difficulties in school, and his mother stopped attending after the 10th grade. He has a maternal uncle with cognitive disabilities. He is at the 25th percentile for height, 15th percentile for weight, and 90th percentile for head circumference. He appears irritable, he resists making eye contact, and he is flapping his hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Frameshift mutation",
        "B": "Missense mutation",
        "C": "Nonsense mutation",
        "D": "Trinucleotide repeat expansion"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's analyze the information provided step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The 2-year-old boy is irritable, resists making eye contact, and is flapping his hands. These behaviors are indicative of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The symptoms of ASD can vary widely, but repetitive behaviors (such as hand flapping) and social communication difficulties (such as resistance to eye contact) are common. 2. **Family History**: The boy's parents had learning difficulties, and his mother stopped attending school after the 10th grade. His maternal uncle also has cognitive disabilities. This family history of learning difficulties and cognitive disabilities suggests a possible genetic component to the boy's condition. 3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The boy is at the 25th percentile for height, 15th percentile for weight, and 90th percentile for head circumference. These growth parameters are not specifically indicative of a particular genetic disorder, but the head circumference is higher than average, which can be seen in certain genetic conditions. 4. **Genetic Considerations**: Given the family history of learning difficulties, cognitive disabilities, and the boy's symptoms of ASD, we need to consider genetic causes that could explain these findings. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. **Frameshift Mutation**: A frameshift mutation is a type of point mutation that occurs when a nucleotide is inserted or deleted, leading to a complete change in the amino acid sequence of a protein. While frameshift mutations can cause genetic disorders, they are not the most likely cause of the boy's condition based on the information provided. B. **Missense Mutation**: A missense mutation is a type of point mutation that results in a different amino acid being encoded in the protein. While missense mutations can cause genetic disorders, they are not the most likely cause of the boy's condition. C. **Nonsense Mutation**: A nonsense mutation is a type of point mutation that results in a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. While nonsense mutations can cause genetic disorders, they are not the most likely cause of the boy's condition. D. **Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion**: Trinucleotide repeat expansions, such as those seen in Fragile X syndrome, are a type of genetic disorder that can cause intellectual disability, ASD, and other symptoms. The family history of learning difficulties, cognitive disabilities, and the boy's symptoms of ASD make this option the most likely cause of his condition. **Answer Choice:** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The boy's symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, family history of learning difficulties and cognitive disabilities, and the physical examination findings of head circumference are most consistent with Fragile X syndrome, which is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
