        "A": "The maxillary bone",
        "B": "The temporal bone",
        "C": "The sphenoid bone",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which bone joins with the zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch, we need to consider the anatomy of the facial bones. The zygomatic bone is a key component of the cheekbone and plays a crucial role in forming the zygomatic arch, which is a curved ridge that forms the prominence of the cheek. The zygomatic bone has several processes that contribute to its formation, including the zygomatic process, which is a long, curved process that extends laterally from the body of the zygomatic bone. This process forms the majority of the zygomatic arch. Now, let's examine the options provided: A. The maxillary bone: The maxillary bone forms the upper jaw and does not directly contribute to the formation of the zygomatic arch. B. The temporal bone: The temporal bone forms part of the skull's lateral surface, including the temporal fossa and the mastoid process, but it does not contribute to the formation of the zygomatic arch. C. The sphenoid bone: The sphenoid bone forms the base of the skull and does not directly contribute to the formation of the zygomatic arch. D. The frontal bone: The frontal bone forms the forehead and does not contribute to the formation of the zygomatic arch. Given the information above, the correct answer is B. The temporal bone has a process called the zygomatic process that joins with the zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
