    "question": "Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS) is a serious complication seen in infants born prematurely who have a compromised ability to facilitate oxygen diffusion across their alveolar membranes. This is caused by inadequate surfactant production. What role does surfactant play in facilitating oxygen diffusion?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Increases surface permeability",
        "B": "Maintains alveoli in an open state",
        "C": "Depresses cilia of the lung",
        "D": "Dilates blood vessels"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's consider the role of surfactant in the lungs. Surfactant is a complex mixture of phospholipids and proteins that lines the alveoli in the lungs. Its primary function is to reduce the surface tension within the alveoli, allowing them to expand more easily during inhalation. This is crucial for maintaining lung function, especially in premature infants who have difficulty producing sufficient surfactant. By reducing surface tension, surfactant facilitates the expansion of alveoli, which in turn increases the surface area available for gas exchange. This allows for more efficient oxygen diffusion into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide removal. Now, let's examine the options provided in the question: A. Increases surface permeability - While surfactant does reduce surface tension, its primary function is not to increase surface permeability. B. Maintains alveoli in an open state - This is the correct answer. Surfactant helps maintain the alveoli in an open state by reducing surface tension, allowing them to expand more easily and facilitating gas exchange. C. Depresses cilia of the lung - Surfactant does not have a direct effect on cilia, which are responsible for moving mucus and debris from the lungs. D. Dilates blood vessels - Surfactant does not directly affect blood vessel diameter, which is regulated by other mechanisms such as smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Maintains alveoli in an open state.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
