    "question": "You notice a lesion on the labial alveolar mucosa of the lower right lateral incisor tooth of one of your patients and decide to take a biopsy to send for oral pathology report Which nerve would require local anaesthesia in order to carry out a pain-free biopsy?",
    "options": {
        "A": "The incisive nerve",
        "B": "The mental nerve",
        "C": "The buccal nerve",
        "D": "The lingual nerve"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To determine which nerve requires local anesthesia to carry out a pain-free biopsy of a lesion on the labial alveolar mucosa, we need to consider the innervation of the labial alveolar mucosa. The labial alveolar mucosa is innervated by the mental nerve, which is a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve (V3). The inferior alveolar nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3). However, the mental nerve itself is a small nerve that primarily provides sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, the anterior two-thirds of the hard palate, and the labial alveolar mucosa. The incisive nerve (A) is a branch of the nasopalatine nerve, which is involved in the innervation of the hard palate, not the labial alveolar mucosa. The buccal nerve (C) is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3) and provides sensation to the buccal mucosa, not the labial alveolar mucosa. The lingual nerve (D) is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3) and provides sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, not the labial alveolar mucosa. Therefore, to carry out a pain-free biopsy of a lesion on the labial alveolar mucosa, local anesthesia should be administered to the mental nerve. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which nerve requires local anesthesia to carry out a pain-free biopsy of a lesion on the labial alveolar mucosa, we need to consider the innervation of the labial alveolar mucosa.
