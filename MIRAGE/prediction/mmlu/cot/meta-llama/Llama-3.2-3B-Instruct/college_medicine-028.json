    "question": "David is a nationally ranked cellist who recently accepted a scholarship to a major college to perform in the orchestra. Over the summer, he has been given a packet of sheet music to be proficient in by fall semester. David is a perfectionist when it comes to his craft. He always compares himself to better players, and is very hard on himself when he cannot master a section of one of his pieces. Which of the following answers best describes David?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control",
        "B": "High self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control",
        "C": "Low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, external locus of control",
        "D": "Low self-esteem, low self-efficacy, internal locus of control"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step: 1. **Self-description as a perfectionist**: David is described as a perfectionist, which implies that he has high standards for himself. This trait is often associated with a strong sense of self-efficacy, as perfectionists tend to believe in their ability to achieve their goals. 2. **Comparison to others**: David compares himself to better players, which suggests that he has a high level of self-awareness and is aware of his own strengths and weaknesses. This awareness is indicative of a strong internal locus of control, as he is actively evaluating his own performance rather than attributing his successes or failures to external factors. 3. **Self-criticism**: David is described as hard on himself when he cannot master a section of a piece, which indicates that he has low self-esteem. This self-criticism suggests that he is overly critical of himself, which is a characteristic of individuals with low self-esteem. Now, let's evaluate the options: - **A. Low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control**: This option is consistent with the analysis. David's self-criticism (low self-esteem) and perfectionism (strong self-efficacy) are balanced by his internal locus of control, as he evaluates his performance internally rather than attributing it to external factors. - **B. High self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control**: This option is inconsistent with the analysis. David's self-criticism (low self-esteem) does not align with high self-esteem. - **C. Low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, external locus of control**: This option is inconsistent with the analysis. David's perfectionism (strong self-efficacy) and internal locus of control are not balanced by low self-esteem. - **D. Low self-esteem, low self-efficacy, internal locus of control**: This option is inconsistent with the analysis. David's perfectionism (strong self-efficacy) is not consistent with low self-efficacy. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"David's perfectionism and self-criticism suggest that he has low self-esteem, but his awareness of his own strengths and weaknesses and evaluation of his performance internally suggest that he has a strong sense of self-efficacy and internal locus of control. This combination is consistent with option A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
