    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the most common mutation associated with cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs and digestive system, caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. The most common mutation is a specific change in the DNA sequence. The most common mutation is a deletion of three nucleotides, specifically a deletion of the nucleotides G, T, and C at position 5 of the sixth exon of the CFTR gene. This deletion is often referred to as the \\u201cDelta F508\\u201d mutation. This mutation leads to the production of an abnormal CFTR protein, resulting in the symptoms associated with cystic fibrosis. Therefore, the most common cystic fibrosis mutation is a deletion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
