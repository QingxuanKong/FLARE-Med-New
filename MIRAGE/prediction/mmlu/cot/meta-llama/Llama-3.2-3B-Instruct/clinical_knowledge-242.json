    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to identify the type of glands that eccrine and apocrine glands are both classified under. Eccrine glands are known for their role in regulating body temperature through sweating, while apocrine glands are also involved in thermoregulation, but primarily through the secretion of a milky fluid. Both types of glands are found in the skin and are responsible for producing a type of secretion. Therefore, the common characteristic that defines eccrine and apocrine glands is their function in secretion, which is a key feature of glands. Now, let's evaluate the options given: Option A, sweat glands, is the correct classification for eccrine and apocrine glands. Sweat glands are a type of exocrine gland that produces sweat, which helps regulate body temperature. Eccrine glands and apocrine glands are both types of sweat glands, with eccrine glands being the primary sweat glands found all over the body and apocrine glands being concentrated in areas such as the armpits and genital area. Option B, salivary glands, are responsible for producing saliva, which is not related to eccrine and apocrine glands. Option C, chemoreceptors, are sensory receptors that detect changes in the chemical composition of the blood or environment, which is not relevant to eccrine and apocrine glands. Option D, tear ducts, are part of the eye's drainage system and are not related to eccrine and apocrine glands. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is A. sweat glands.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"A\"",
