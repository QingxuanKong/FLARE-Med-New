    "options": {
        "A": "It is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum.",
        "B": "It is typically associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face.",
        "C": "Its composite flattened cisternae are continuous with one another.",
        "D": "Glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs prior to the protein's entry into its lumen."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down the function and structure of the Golgi apparatus step by step.\\n\\nThe Golgi apparatus is a complex organelle found in eukaryotic cells that plays a crucial role in processing, modifying, and packaging proteins and lipids for secretion or use within the cell.\\n\\nThe Golgi apparatus consists of a stack of flattened cisternae (membrane-bound sacs) that are arranged in a characteristic 'cisternal arrangement'. These cisternae are indeed continuous with one another, forming a single, interconnected unit.\\n\\nThe cis face of the Golgi apparatus is located towards the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where proteins and lipids are synthesized and transported to the Golgi for modification and processing. The trans face of the Golgi apparatus is towards the cytoplasm, where the modified proteins and lipids are packaged into vesicles for secretion or further processing.\\n\\nGlycosylation, the process of adding carbohydrate molecules to proteins, typically occurs in the Golgi apparatus, specifically in the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus, not prior to the protein's entry into its lumen. This process can occur in the early cisternae (cis face) or in the later cisternae (trans face), depending on the specific protein being modified.\\n\\nNow, considering the options provided:\\nOption A is incorrect because the cis face of the Golgi apparatus is not closest to the endoplasmic reticulum, but rather, the ER is closest to the cis face.\\nOption B is incorrect because the Golgi apparatus is not typically associated with small secretory vesicles, but rather, it packages proteins and lipids into vesicles.\\nOption C is correct because the composite flattened cisternae of the Golgi apparatus are indeed continuous with one another.\\nOption D is incorrect because glycosylation occurs in the Golgi apparatus, not prior to the protein's entry into its lumen.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
