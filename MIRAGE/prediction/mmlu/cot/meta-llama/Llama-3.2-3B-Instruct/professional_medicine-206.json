    "question": "A 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of malaise, muscle and joint pain, and temperatures to 38.4\u00b0C (101.1\u00b0F) for 3 days. Three months ago, he underwent cadaveric renal transplantation resulting in immediate kidney function. At the time of discharge, his serum creatinine concentration was 0.8 mg/dL. He is receiving cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Examination shows no abnormalities. His leukocyte count is 2700/mm3 , and serum creatinine concentration is 1.6 mg/dL; serum cyclosporine concentration is in the therapeutic range. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows intracellular inclusion bodies. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Increase the dosage of corticosteroids",
        "B": "Increase the dosage of cyclosporine",
        "C": "Begin amphotericin therapy",
        "D": "Begin ganciclovir therapy"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and examination: 1. **Patient's symptoms**: The patient presents with malaise, muscle and joint pain, and fever, which are non-specific symptoms that can be seen in various conditions, including infections and rejection of the transplanted kidney. 2. **History of kidney transplantation**: The patient underwent cadaveric renal transplantation three months ago, which increases the risk of post-transplant complications, including rejection and infections. 3. **Current immunosuppressive regimen**: The patient is receiving cyclosporine and corticosteroids, which are standard immunosuppressive medications for preventing rejection in transplant patients. 4. **Laboratory findings**: The patient has a slightly elevated serum creatinine concentration (1.6 mg/dL), which indicates some degree of kidney dysfunction. The leukocyte count is normal, which makes an acute bacterial infection less likely. The serum cyclosporine concentration is within the therapeutic range, which suggests that the immunosuppression is not excessively high. 5. **Biopsy findings**: The presence of intracellular inclusion bodies in the transplanted kidney is a critical finding. Inclusion bodies are a hallmark of viral infections in the context of immunosuppressed patients. Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is a viral infection, specifically cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, which is a common cause of morbidity in immunosuppressed transplant patients. CMV infection can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, fatigue, and malaise, and can also cause kidney dysfunction. Given this diagnosis, the most appropriate next step in management would be to initiate antiviral therapy. Among the options provided, ganciclovir is an antiviral medication that is effective against CMV infection. Therefore, the answer is: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of immunosuppression and presents with symptoms and biopsy findings consistent with a viral infection. The presence of intracellular inclusion bodies is highly suggestive of CMV infection. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to initiate antiviral therapy with ganciclovir.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"} ```",
