    "question": "A 37-year-old man comes to the physician because of nonradiating low back pain for 3 days. The pain began after he worked in his yard. He has not had any change in bowel movements or urination. He had one similar episode 3 years ago that resolved spontaneously. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the back shows bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm. Range of motion is limited by pain. Straight-leg raising is negative. In addition to analgesia, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Bed rest",
        "B": "Regular activity",
        "C": "X-rays of the spine",
        "D": "MRI of the spine"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer: **Step 1: Assess the patient's symptoms and medical history** The patient is a 37-year-old man with non-radiating low back pain that began after physical activity (working in his yard). He has a history of similar episodes in the past that resolved spontaneously. This suggests a possible musculoskeletal origin for the pain. **Step 2: Evaluate the physical examination findings** The patient has bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm and limited range of motion due to pain. However, the straight-leg raising test is negative, which suggests that there is no evidence of nerve root irritation or sciatica. **Step 3: Consider the differential diagnosis** Given the acute onset of pain after physical activity and the absence of neurological deficits, the likely diagnosis is musculoskeletal in origin, such as a strain or muscle spasm. **Step 4: Choose the most appropriate next step in management** In this case, the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a musculoskeletal injury. The goal of the next step is to promote healing and reduce pain while allowing the patient to return to normal activities. **Answer** \"Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most appropriate next step in management is to recommend regular activity, as it will help maintain range of motion, reduce muscle spasm, and promote healing. Bed rest (A) may not be necessary in this case, as it may prolong recovery time. X-rays of the spine (C) may be considered if there are concerns about fractures or other bony abnormalities, but they are not indicated in this case. An MRI of the spine (D) is not necessary as there are no neurological deficits or red flags present.\" **JSON output:** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a musculoskeletal origin for the pain. The absence of neurological deficits and the negative straight-leg raising test support this diagnosis. The goal of the next step is to promote healing and reduce pain while allowing the patient to return to normal activities. Regular activity is the most appropriate next step in management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
