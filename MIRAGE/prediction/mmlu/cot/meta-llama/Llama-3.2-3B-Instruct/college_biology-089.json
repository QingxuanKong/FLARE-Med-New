    "question": "A recent theory concerning an unusual rise in asthma attacks following a thunderstorm proposes that while pollen grains at 5 microns are too large to enter the airways, their exposure to water precipitates the release of starch granules as a result of osmotic shock. The starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack. If this theory is true, which of the following is a correct statement?",
    "options": {
        "A": "The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.",
        "B": "The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.",
        "C": "The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents.",
        "D": "The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To analyze the situation and determine the correct answer, let's break down the process described in the theory: 1. Pollen grains are exposed to water, which causes osmotic shock. 2. The osmotic shock results in the release of starch granules from the pollen grains. 3. The starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack. Now, let's examine the options in the context of the described process: A. The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment. - If the interior of the pollen grains were hypotonic, it would mean that the concentration of solutes inside the pollen grain was lower than in the surrounding environment. This would not cause the pollen grains to swell or rupture due to osmotic shock. B. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment. - If the interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure, it would cause the pollen grains to shrink or plasmolize, not swell or rupture. This is the opposite of what is described in the theory. C. The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents. - Plasmolysis is the process of shrinking due to a decrease in the concentration of solutes in the cell. Given that the theory states the pollen grains swell (due to osmotic shock) and then rupture, it's likely the pollen grains underwent plasmolysis before releasing their contents. D. The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents. - This option is incorrect based on the description of the process. The pollen grains are said to swell due to osmotic shock, not shrink. Considering the analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The theory proposes that the pollen grains swell due to osmotic shock, which causes the release of starch granules. However, the interior of the pollen grains must have been hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment in order to undergo plasmolysis before swelling. This is the correct sequence of events: plasmolysis (shrinkage) due to a lower solute concentration, followed by swelling due to the influx of water, and finally rupture to release the starch granules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
