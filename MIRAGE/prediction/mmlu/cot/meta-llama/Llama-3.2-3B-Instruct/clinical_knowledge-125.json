        "A": "women have evolved a greater muscle mass.",
        "B": "women can now run faster than men.",
        "C": "women have started training at an earlier age.",
        "D": "more women are now engaged in sport."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the factors that contribute to improvements in women's world record performances in various sports. While it's true that women have made significant progress in sports, the primary reason for the rapid improvement is not due to an increase in muscle mass or running speed. Women have consistently shown that they can run at similar speeds to men over the same distance. Furthermore, while some women may start training at a younger age, this is not a universal trend and does not account for the rapid progress across all sports. Lastly, while more women are participating in sports, this increase in participation does not directly translate to improved world record performances. The most plausible explanation is that women have gained access to better training facilities, nutrition, and sports science support, which has enabled them to optimize their performance. This is evident in various sports, such as track and field, where women's world records have been broken by athletes who have access to top-notch coaching, sports medicine, and training facilities. Therefore, the correct answer is D. more women are now engaged in sport, but a more precise answer would be that women have better access to resources and support to improve their performance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
