    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's consider the process of embryonic development and how the distribution of substances within the egg influences the formation of the embryo. The egg, or oocyte, contains all the genetic material necessary for the development of a new individual. As the cell divides, the distribution of these substances, including genes, is crucial for the proper formation of tissues and organs. The question asks about the differential distribution of substances in the egg, which implies a process that leads to variation or specialization of cells or tissues. Let's examine the options provided: Option A, differences in gene expression, is a plausible explanation. Gene expression is the process by which the information encoded in a gene is used to direct the assembly of a protein molecule. Differential gene expression can lead to differences in the properties of cells, such as cell type, and can establish patterns in the embryo as cells divide. This process can result in the formation of distinct tissues and organs. Option B, amplification of specific genes during development, is also a possible explanation. Gene amplification can lead to an increase in the number of copies of a particular gene, which can result in the overproduction of a specific protein. However, this does not necessarily imply a differential distribution of substances. Option C, development of polyploid tissues, refers to the presence of more than two sets of chromosomes in cells. While polyploidy can occur in some tissues, it is not directly related to the differential distribution of substances in the egg. Option D, loss of specific genes during development, is not a typical explanation for differential distribution of substances in the egg. In fact, the loss of genes would more likely lead to a decrease in the complexity and diversity of the embryo. Considering these explanations, the most plausible answer is A, differences in gene expression, which can lead to the establishment of patterns in the embryo as cells divide and differentiate.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"A\"",
