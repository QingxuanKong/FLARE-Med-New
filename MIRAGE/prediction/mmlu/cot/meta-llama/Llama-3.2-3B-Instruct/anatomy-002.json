The kidneys (B) are responsible for filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood and produce urine, but they do not collect it. The ureters (C) are tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder, but they do not store urine. The urethra (D) is the tube that carries urine out of the body, but it does not collect urine either.\\n\\nThis leaves us with the bladder (A), which is a hollow, muscular organ that stores urine until it is eliminated from the body through the urethra.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
