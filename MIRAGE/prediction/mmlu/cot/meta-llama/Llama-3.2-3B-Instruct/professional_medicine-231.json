    "question": "A 19-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because, she says, \"I'm burning up.\" Medical history is significant for intravenous drug use. Physical examination discloses a systolic heart murmur over the precordium. An expected physical finding will be which of the following?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Decreased intensity of S1",
        "B": "Increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration",
        "C": "Increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration",
        "D": "Positive Kussmaul sign (rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration)"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient is a 19-year-old woman with a history of intravenous drug use, presenting with a fever (burning up), and a systolic heart murmur. The presence of a systolic heart murmur is concerning for endocarditis, which is a common complication of intravenous drug use. One of the classic signs of endocarditis is the presence of a new heart murmur, and it can be associated with various physical findings. Let's evaluate the options given to determine the most likely expected physical finding in this patient.\\n\\nOption A: Decreased intensity of S1 - This is not typically associated with endocarditis. In fact, the intensity of S1 may be increased due to the regurgitant volume of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium.\\n\\nOption B: Increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration - This is not a characteristic finding in endocarditis. The intensity of the murmur may actually decrease with inspiration due to the decrease in intrathoracic pressure, which can reduce the regurgitant volume.\\n\\nOption C: Increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration - This is the correct answer. In endocarditis, the murmur may be accentuated by forced expiration due to the increased intrathoracic pressure, which increases the regurgitant volume of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium.\\n\\nOption D: Positive Kussmaul sign (rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration) - This sign is typically associated with tricuspid regurgitation, not endocarditis. It is not a characteristic finding in this patient's presentation.\\n\\nTherefore, the expected physical finding in this patient with a systolic heart murmur and a history of intravenous drug use is an increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
