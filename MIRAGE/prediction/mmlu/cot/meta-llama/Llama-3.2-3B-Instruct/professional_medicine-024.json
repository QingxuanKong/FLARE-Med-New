    "question": "A 16-year-old high school student, whose prenatal course you have managed, delivers a 3256-g (7-lb 3-oz) baby girl during the night with the assistance of your associate. On morning rounds you note that the delivery records report that she had mildly elevated blood pressure during labor and sustained an estimated third-stage blood loss of 500 mL. Today blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg, she is afebrile, and deep tendon reflexes are normal. The uterine fundus is firm and at the level of the umbilicus, and her perineum is slightly edematous. Hematocrit is 33%. She is cuddling her infant and normal bonding seems to be occurring. Which of the following is the most important next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Begin oral methyldopa",
        "B": "Institute fundal massage",
        "C": "Order daily sitz baths",
        "D": "Provide education for well-baby care"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this scenario, let's break down the key points and analyze the situation step by step. 1. The patient is a 16-year-old postpartum patient with a normal blood pressure and normal vital signs. Her uterine fundus is firm, which is consistent with a normal postpartum uterus. 2. The patient had a significant estimated blood loss of 500 mL during the third stage of labor, which is a moderate to large blood loss. This is a risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), especially in a young patient. 3. The patient's hematocrit is 33%, which is lower than the normal range for a non-pregnant adult (typically 40-54%). This indicates anemia, which is a common complication in postpartum patients, especially those with significant blood loss. 4. The patient is afebrile and has normal deep tendon reflexes, which suggests that there are no immediate signs of infection or neurological complications. 5. Given the patient's age, the presence of anemia, and the significant blood loss, the primary concern is the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. Considering these points, the most appropriate next step in management would be to assess the patient for signs of postpartum hemorrhage and to ensure that the uterus is contracting properly. Fundal massage is a technique used to massage the uterus to help stimulate uterine contractions and reduce bleeding. The other options are not the most appropriate next steps: A. Oral methyldopa is a medication used to manage hypertension, which is not indicated in this scenario since the patient's blood pressure is normal. C. Sitz baths are not a standard treatment for postpartum hemorrhage or uterine atony. D. Education for well-baby care is important, but it is not the most critical next step in management in this scenario. Therefore, the most important next step in management is to institute fundal massage to assess for uterine atony and to stimulate uterine contractions.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
