    "predict": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Understanding the given information**: - The disorder is X-linked recessive. - The disorder is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. - The incidence of the disorder in males is 1 in 100. 2. **Understanding Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium**: - In a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of each allele and genotype in a population remains constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences. - This means the allele and genotype frequencies can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg principle. 3. **Calculating allele frequencies**: - Since the disorder is X-linked recessive, we assume that the allele frequency of the affected allele (let's call it 'a') is 'q' (since the disorder is recessive, 'q' represents the allele frequency of the disease-causing allele) and the normal allele is 'Q' (representing the normal allele). - The frequency of the normal allele (Q) can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium formula: p^2 = q^2 + 2pq, where p is the frequency of the normal allele (Q) and q is the frequency of the disease-causing allele (a). However, since we are given the frequency of the disorder in males (1 in 100), we will use the fact that the frequency of the affected allele in males is q, and we know that the frequency of the disorder in females is 1 in 2000 (since females are heterozygous or homozygous for the normal allele, and the disorder is recessive). 4. **Calculating the frequency of the affected allele in females**: - Since the disorder is recessive, females have two alleles, one from each parent. Therefore, a female can be either homozygous (aa) or heterozygous (Aa) for the disorder. The frequency of the disorder in females is 1 in 2000, which means the frequency of the heterozygous genotype (Aa) is 1 in 2000, and the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (aa) is 1 in 4000. - Since the disorder is X-linked recessive, the frequency of the affected allele 'a' is the same in males and females. 5. **Calculating the frequency of the affected allele (q) in females**: - Since the frequency of the disorder in females is 1 in 2000, we can assume that the frequency of the heterozygous genotype (Aa) is 1 in 2000. This means that 1/2 of the females are Aa (heterozygous) and 1/2 of the females are AA (homozygous normal). The frequency of the affected allele 'a' in females is therefore 1/4 of the frequency of the heterozygous genotype (Aa), which is 1/4 * 1 in 2000 = 1 in 8000. 6. **Selecting the answer**: - Based on the above calculation, the expected incidence of affected homozygous females would be 1 in 40,000. Here is the answer in json format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information, then calculate the allele frequencies, and finally use those frequencies to determine the expected incidence of affected homozygous females. The disorder is X-linked recessive, and the frequency of the disorder in males is 1 in 100. The disorder is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequency of the affected allele 'a' in males is q, and the frequency of the disorder in females is 1 in 2000. We can calculate the frequency of the affected allele 'a' in females by considering the frequency of the heterozygous genotype (Aa) in females. Since the disorder is recessive, females have two alleles, one from each parent. Therefore, a female can be either homozygous (aa) or heterozygous (Aa) for the disorder. The frequency of the disorder in females is 1 in 2000, which means the frequency of the heterozygous genotype (Aa) is 1 in 2000, and the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (aa) is 1 in 4000. Since the frequency of the affected allele 'a' is the same in males and females, the frequency of the affected allele 'a' in females is 1/4 of the frequency of the heterozygous genotype (Aa), which is 1/4 * 1 in 2000 = 1 in 8000.
