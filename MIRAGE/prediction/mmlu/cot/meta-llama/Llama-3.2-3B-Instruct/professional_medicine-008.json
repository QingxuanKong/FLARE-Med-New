    "question": "A 51-year-old man comes to the office because of a 6-month history of a lump on his tongue that is interfering with his speech and eating; he also has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss during this period. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily and has consumed six 12-oz bottles of beer on weekend nights during the past 30 years. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 1.5-cm mass on the apex of the tongue. Further evaluation of the mass confirms squamous cell carcinoma. It is most appropriate to evaluate which of the following lymph nodes first for evidence of metastasis in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Inferior deep cervical",
        "B": "Parotid",
        "C": "Retropharyngeal",
        "D": "Submental"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To determine the most appropriate lymph node to evaluate first for metastasis in this patient, we need to consider the location of the primary tumor and the lymphatic drainage pattern of the tongue. The tongue is divided into anterior and posterior parts, and each part has its own lymphatic drainage. The anterior part of the tongue drains to the submental lymph nodes, while the posterior part drains to the deep cervical lymph nodes. In this case, the tumor is located on the apex of the tongue, which is the posterior part of the tongue. Therefore, the primary lymphatic drainage of the tumor is to the deep cervical lymph nodes. Evaluating the deep cervical lymph nodes first will help to determine if the cancer has spread to these nodes, which is a common site for metastasis in oral cancers. Here is the step-by-step thinking in JSON format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate lymph node to evaluate first, we need to consider the location of the primary tumor and the lymphatic drainage pattern of the tongue. The tongue is divided into anterior and posterior parts, and each part has its own lymphatic drainage. The anterior part of the tongue drains to the submental lymph nodes, while the posterior part drains to the deep cervical lymph nodes. Since the tumor is located on the apex of the tongue, which is the posterior part, the primary lymphatic drainage of the tumor is to the deep cervical lymph nodes. Evaluating these nodes first will help to determine if the cancer has spread to these nodes, which is a common site for metastasis in oral cancers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ``` The final answer is C. Retropharyngeal lymph nodes are not the primary site for drainage of the tongue, so they are not the most appropriate choice. Inferior deep cervical lymph nodes are a possible site for metastasis, but they are not the primary site for drainage of the tongue. Submental lymph nodes are the primary site for drainage of the anterior part of the tongue, but not the posterior part where the tumor is located.",
