        "A": "mtDNA mutates at a slower rate than nuclear DNA.",
        "B": "mtDNA is passed from mother to child and is free from recombination that occurs between pairs of chromosomes.",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the characteristics of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and how it relates to studying the relatedness of animal populations. Let's evaluate each option given: Option A: mtDNA does not mutate at a slower rate than nuclear DNA. In fact, mtDNA mutates at a higher rate than nuclear DNA due to the high replication error rate in mitochondria. So, this option is incorrect. Option B: mtDNA is passed from mother to child, and it is free from recombination that occurs between pairs of chromosomes. This is a key characteristic of mtDNA, as it is inherited maternally and does not undergo crossing over, which reduces genetic recombination. This makes mtDNA useful for tracing maternal lineage and studying population relationships. Option C: There are many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the hypervariable, noncoding regions of mtDNA. These regions, such as the control region and the hypervariable segments (HVS), have high mutation rates and are used to analyze genetic variation and population history. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option D: All mitochondrial proteins are coded for by mitochondrial genes. While it is true that mtDNA encodes some proteins, not all mitochondrial proteins are coded for by mtDNA. Many proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA and are imported into the mitochondria for assembly. So, this option is also incorrect. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is B: mtDNA is passed from mother to child and is free from recombination that occurs between pairs of chromosomes.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
