    "question": "A healthy 2-year-old girl is brought to the office for a routine well-child visit. The child was weaned at 6 months of age and began to walk at 10 months of age. On physical examination, she has mild bowlegs (10-degree genu varum). Which of the following is the most appropriate management to recommend at this time?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Increased intake of vitamin D",
        "B": "A special exercise program",
        "C": "Surgical correction",
        "D": "No treatment is needed at this time"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. The child is a 2-year-old girl with a history of being weaned at 6 months and walking at 10 months, which is within the normal range for her age. 2. The physical examination reveals mild bowlegs (10-degree genu varum), which is a relatively mild degree of bowlegs. 3. Bowlegs in children are often associated with rickets or other bone disorders, but in this case, the child is otherwise healthy and has no other symptoms or signs of a systemic illness. 4. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of rickets, but the child's diet and nutrition are not mentioned, and there is no other indication of deficiency. 5. Surgical correction is generally considered for more severe cases of bowlegs that cause significant functional impairment or cosmetic concerns. 6. A special exercise program may be beneficial for improving muscle strength and bone density, but it is not a primary treatment for mild bowlegs. 7. Considering the child's overall health and the mild degree of bowlegs, the most appropriate management would be to monitor her growth and development closely and provide guidance on nutrition and lifestyle. Therefore, the most appropriate management to recommend at this time is D. No treatment is needed at this time, as the child is otherwise healthy and the bowlegs are mild.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
