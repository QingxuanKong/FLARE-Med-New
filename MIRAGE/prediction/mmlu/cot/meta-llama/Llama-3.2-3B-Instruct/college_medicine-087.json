Genetic material is the substance that carries the genetic information necessary for the development and function of all living organisms. It is typically found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and is responsible for passing on genetic traits from one generation to the next. The main components of genetic material are nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
