    "question": "While working on a scene for an action movie, a sound technician is given the task of changing the frequency of a gunshot to more accurately reflect the normal speed of sound. The gunshot came from an actor inside a car traveling 108 km/h, and it was recorded by a camera on a platform 200 meters away traveling at 72 km/h in the same direction. If the frequency of the gunshot is normally 800Hz, what is the perceived frequency which the camera picks up the gunshot at?",
    "options": {
        "A": "941 Hz",
        "B": "787 Hz",
        "C": "924 Hz",
        "D": "912 Hz"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Doppler effect formula for sound waves, which is given by: f' = f * (v + v_o) / (v - v_s) where: - f' is the perceived frequency - f is the original frequency (800 Hz) - v is the speed of sound in air (approximately 343 m/s at room temperature and atmospheric pressure) - v_o is the speed of the observer (camera, 72 km/h = 20 m/s) - v_s is the speed of the source (actor, 108 km/h = 30 m/s) First, let's convert the speeds from km/h to m/s: v_o = 72 km/h = 20 m/s v_s = 108 km/h = 30 m/s Now, let's plug in the values into the formula: f' = 800 Hz * (343 m/s + 20 m/s) / (343 m/s - 30 m/s) f' = 800 Hz * (363 m/s) / (313 m/s) f' = 800 Hz * 1.165 f' = 932 Hz However, this is not among the answer choices. This is likely due to rounding errors in the calculation. Let's recalculate the answer to 3 decimal places: f' = 800 Hz * (343 m/s + 20 m/s) / (343 m/s - 30 m/s) f' = 800 Hz * (363.000 m/s) / (313.000 m/s) f' = 800 Hz * 1.165 f' = 932.000 Hz The closest answer choice to our calculated answer is 941 Hz.
