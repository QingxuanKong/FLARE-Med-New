If a catheter resists all attempts to unblock it and removal is not possible, the first step should be to assess the situation and consider the potential complications. If the catheter is causing discomfort or pain to the patient, we should take steps to alleviate that. However, if the catheter is not causing any immediate harm and the patient is stable, the next step would be to call for assistance from a medical practitioner. This is because a medical professional may have the necessary skills and equipment to safely remove the catheter or provide further guidance on the best course of action. Trying harder to remove the catheter (options A and B) could potentially cause more harm to the patient, while leaving it in place until next time (option C) may not be feasible or safe. Therefore, the most appropriate course of action would be to seek assistance from a medical practitioner.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
