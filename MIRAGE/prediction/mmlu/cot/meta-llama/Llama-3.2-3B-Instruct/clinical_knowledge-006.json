    "options": {
        "A": "Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered",
        "B": "The outer image is always the false image",
        "C": "A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards",
        "D": "A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint"

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. Option A: Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered. This statement is false. Even if one eye is covered, if the brain is still receiving two different images from each eye, it can still perceive double vision. This is because the brain can combine the images from each eye to create the perception of double vision. So, option A is incorrect. 2. Option B: The outer image is always the false image. This statement is also false. In diplopia, the false image is not always the outer image. The location of the false image can vary depending on the cause of the diplopia. For example, in a superior oblique palsy, the false image is usually seen in the downward direction, not the outer direction. So, option B is incorrect. 3. Option C: A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards. This statement is true. The fourth cranial nerve, also known as the trochlear nerve, controls the superior oblique muscle, which is responsible for rotating the eye downward and inward when it is in the adducted position. A palsy of this nerve can cause diplopia, especially when the patient looks upwards. This is because the superior oblique muscle is not functioning properly, leading to an imbalance in eye movements and resulting in double vision. So, option C is correct. 4. Option D: A sixth nerve palsy causes a convergent squint. This statement is false. A sixth nerve palsy, also known as abducens nerve palsy, affects the lateral rectus muscle, which is responsible for outward movement of the eye. A palsy of this nerve typically causes esotropia (inward squint), not exotropia (outward squint). So, option D is incorrect. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is option C: A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
