    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis. Glycolysis is the process by which glucose is converted into pyruvate, producing a small amount of ATP and NADH in the process. There are two main substrate-level phosphorylation reactions in glycolysis: 1. The conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, which generates 1 ATP molecule per molecule of PEP. 2. The conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate, which generates 1 ATP molecule per molecule of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. In total, glycolysis produces 2 ATP molecules directly from the breakdown of glucose. However, glycogen is a polysaccharide made up of glucose units that are linked together through alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds. When glycogen is broken down into glucose-1-phosphate, the 2 ATP molecules produced in the breakdown of glucose are converted to 2 ADP molecules, which are then converted to 2 ATP molecules through substrate-level phosphorylation. Since 1 glucose molecule produces 2 ATP molecules, and 1 glycogen molecule is equivalent to 1 glucose molecule (since glycogen is essentially a polymer of glucose), we can conclude that 1 glycogen molecule also produces 2 ATP molecules. Therefore, the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis is 2 from glucose and 2 from glycogen.
