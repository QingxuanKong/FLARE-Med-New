    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to consider the innervation of the tongue. The somatic sensation of the tongue is provided by the lingual nerve, which is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V3). The lingual nerve carries sensory information from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) is involved in taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, but it does not provide somatic sensation. The glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) provides taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue. The hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII) is primarily involved in motor function, controlling the movement of the tongue. Therefore, the correct answer is related to the lingual nerve, which is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
