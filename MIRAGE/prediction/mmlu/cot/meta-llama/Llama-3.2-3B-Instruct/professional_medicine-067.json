    "question": "A 32-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 8 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for her first prenatal visit. She delivered her first child spontaneously at 34 weeks' gestation; pregnancy was complicated by iron deficiency anemia. She has no other history of serious illness. Her blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities. Ultrasonography shows a dichorionic-diamniotic twin intrauterine pregnancy consistent in size with an 8-week gestation. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Abruptio placentae",
        "B": "Fetal chromosome abnormality",
        "C": "Hyperthyroidism",
        "D": "Preterm labor and delivery"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the patient's medical history and the characteristics of the pregnancy. The patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia, which is a common cause of preterm labor and delivery. Additionally, she is carrying twins, which increases the risk of preterm labor and delivery. The patient's blood pressure is normal, and there are no other risk factors mentioned, so we can rule out options A and C. The patient's ultrasound shows a dichorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancy, which is a type of monochorionic-diamniotic (MoDi) twin pregnancy. MoDi twin pregnancies are at higher risk for complications such as preterm labor and delivery, but the risk is not as high as in monochorionic-monoamniotic (MoMo) twin pregnancies. Therefore, option B is less likely. Considering the patient's history of preterm labor and delivery with her first pregnancy, option D is the most likely complication she is at increased risk for.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
