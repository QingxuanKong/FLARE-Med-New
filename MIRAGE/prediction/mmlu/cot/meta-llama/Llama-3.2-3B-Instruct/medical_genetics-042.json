This enzyme is crucial for breaking down a certain type of fatty substance in the brain and nerve cells.\\n\\nNow, let's examine the options given:\\n\\nOption A: Alpha-L-iduronidase is the enzyme deficient in Hurler syndrome, another type of mucopolysaccharidosis.\\n\\nOption B: Glucose-6-phosphatase is involved in glucose metabolism and is deficient in von Gierke's disease, a glycogen storage disorder.\\n\\nOption C: Hexosaminidase A is the enzyme deficient in Tay-Sachs disease, which is characterized by the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in the brain and nerve cells.\\n\\nOption D: Homogentisic acid oxidase is the enzyme deficient in alkaptonuria, a condition that causes urine to turn black upon oxidation.\\n\\nConsidering these facts, the correct answer is clear.\\n\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
