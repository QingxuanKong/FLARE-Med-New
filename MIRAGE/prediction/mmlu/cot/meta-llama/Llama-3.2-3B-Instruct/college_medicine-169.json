    "question": "During DNA replication, mistakes are coded into the leading strand about once every 100,000/1 million copies. This DNA is subject to proofreading by several mechanisms. If a mistake is noted and the incorrect base is removed shortly following the time RNA primer is removed, this would most likely be the work of which repair mechanism?",
    "options": {
        "A": "DNA polymerase I",
        "B": "DNA polymerase III",
        "C": "Mismatch repair mechanism",
        "D": "Endonuclease repair"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to understand the roles of the different DNA repair mechanisms and the process of DNA replication. First, DNA polymerase III is the primary enzyme responsible for synthesizing the leading strand during DNA replication. However, it is not capable of correcting mistakes that occur on the leading strand. DNA polymerase I, on the other hand, is an enzyme found in prokaryotes (bacteria) that can remove RNA primers and fill in gaps with DNA nucleotides. While it can remove RNA primers, its primary function is not proofreading or correcting mistakes on the leading strand. Mismatch repair mechanism is a process that corrects errors in DNA replication and recombination. It recognizes and corrects mismatched bases, but it is not the primary mechanism for correcting mistakes on the leading strand shortly after RNA primer removal. Endonuclease repair is a process that involves the use of endonucleases to remove DNA sequences. It is not directly related to the correction of mistakes on the leading strand after RNA primer removal. Given the context of the question, the most likely repair mechanism to correct mistakes on the leading strand shortly after RNA primer removal is DNA polymerase I. It is the only enzyme listed that can remove RNA primers and fill in gaps with DNA nucleotides, which would allow it to correct mistakes on the leading strand.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
