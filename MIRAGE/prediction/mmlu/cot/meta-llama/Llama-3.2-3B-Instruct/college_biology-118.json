    "question": "Proteins were shown to move about in a plane of the plasma membrane when mouse cellsurface proteins and human cell-surface proteins were observed to integrate along a fused mouse-human cell plasma membrane. Which of the following cell culture techniques was most likely employed in order to yield these results?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Producing a heterokaryon",
        "B": "Producing a hybrid cell",
        "C": "Isolating an immortal variant cell from culture and using it to create a cell line",
        "D": "Inserting a tumor-inducing virus into a normal cell to initiate transformation"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option in the context of the given scenario. The key detail here is the observation of mouse cell-surface proteins and human cell-surface proteins on a fused mouse-human cell plasma membrane. This suggests a cell-cell fusion event, where two different cell types are combined to form a new cell. Now, let's evaluate each option: Option A, producing a heterokaryon, refers to a cell that contains two or more nuclei, each from a different cell. While this is a type of cell fusion, it doesn't necessarily imply the combination of cell surface proteins from two different species. Option B, producing a hybrid cell, is a more general term that can refer to a cell that has been fused with another cell, but it doesn't specify the origin of the cell surface proteins. Option C, isolating an immortal variant cell from culture and using it to create a cell line, involves cell transformation, which is a different process altogether. It doesn't involve cell fusion. Option D, inserting a tumor-inducing virus into a normal cell to initiate transformation, also involves cell transformation and is not relevant to the observation of cell surface proteins from two different species. Given the details of the scenario, the most likely technique employed is Option B, producing a hybrid cell, as it directly involves the fusion of two different cells, which can result in the combination of cell surface proteins from both species.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
