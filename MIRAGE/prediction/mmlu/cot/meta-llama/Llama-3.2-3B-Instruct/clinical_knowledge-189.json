    "options": {
        "A": "Bleeding haemorrhoids lead to melaena per rectum (PR)",
        "B": "Pregnancy is a predisposing factor in causing haemorrhoids",
        "C": "Bleeding from first degree haemorrhoids is associated with pain",
        "D": "Second degree haemorrhoids cannot be returned to the anal canal"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. Option A: Melaena per rectum (PR) is typically associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, not hemorrhoids. Melaena per rectum refers to fresh blood in the stool, which is usually a sign of upper GI bleeding. Hemorrhoids, on the other hand, typically cause bright red or dark, tarry stools. So, option A is incorrect. 2. Option B: Pregnancy is indeed a predisposing factor for hemorrhoids. The increased pressure from the growing uterus on the veins in the rectum can cause hemorrhoids. This is a well-established fact, making option B correct. 3. Option C: First-degree hemorrhoids are typically painless, while second-degree hemorrhoids can cause some discomfort or itching. However, significant pain is not typically associated with first-degree hemorrhoids. This makes option C incorrect. 4. Option D: Second-degree hemorrhoids can indeed be prolapsing, meaning they can protrude back into the anal canal, but they can also be returned to the anal canal once they prolapse. The prolapse is a complication that can occur, but it's not a fixed characteristic of second-degree hemorrhoids. This makes option D incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
