DNA is composed of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA. Each nucleotide consists of three main components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and a phosphate group.\\n\\nOption A: Purine is a type of nitrogenous base found in DNA. There are two main types of purines: adenine (A) and guanine (G).\\n\\nOption B: Pyrimidine is also a type of nitrogenous base found in DNA. The two main types of pyrimidines are cytosine (C) and thymine (T).\\n\\nOption C: Deoxyribose is a type of pentose sugar found in DNA. It is the five-carbon sugar that makes up the backbone of DNA.\\n\\nOption D: Amino acid is a compound that contains both a carboxyl (-COOH) and an amino (-NH2) group. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, not DNA.\\n\\nConsidering these facts, it's clear that amino acid does not form part of DNA, as it is a component of proteins, not DNA.\\n\\n\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
