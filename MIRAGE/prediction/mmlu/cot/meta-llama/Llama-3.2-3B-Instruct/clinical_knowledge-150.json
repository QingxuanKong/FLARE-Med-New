    "options": {
        "A": "Only patients over 60 years of age.",
        "B": "Only patients admitted to the Emergency Department.",
        "C": "Only patients who have been on an Intensive care/High dependency unit.",
        "D": "Any patient who is acutely unwell pre-operatively or post-operatively and those who have undergone major surgery."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking: 1. **Understanding the purpose of Early Warning Scores (EWS):** EWS is a tool used to quickly assess the severity of a patient's condition, particularly in critical care settings. It helps healthcare professionals identify patients who may be deteriorating and require prompt intervention. 2. **Considering the options:** - **A. Only patients over 60 years of age:** While age can be a factor in patient assessment, it is not the sole criterion for using EWS. EWS is not limited to elderly patients. - **B. Only patients admitted to the Emergency Department:** While EWS is commonly used in Emergency Departments, it is not exclusive to this setting. Patients in other departments, such as intensive care units, may also benefit from EWS. - **C. Only patients who have been on an Intensive care/High dependency unit:** Similar to option B, EWS is not limited to patients in ICUs or HDUs. It can be applied to patients in various care settings. - **D. Any patient who is acutely unwell pre-operatively or post-operatively and those who have undergone major surgery:** This option emphasizes the importance of using EWS in patients who are at risk of complications due to their medical history, surgical procedure, or acute illness. 3. **Conclusion:** Based on the purpose and application of EWS, the most appropriate answer is the one that encompasses patients who are at high risk of complications due to their medical history, surgical procedure, or acute illness. Therefore, my answer is: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"EWS should be used for patients who are at high risk of complications due to their medical history, surgical procedure, or acute illness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"} ```",
