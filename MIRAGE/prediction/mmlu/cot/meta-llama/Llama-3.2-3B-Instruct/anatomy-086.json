The maxillary tuberosity resorbs as the permanent molars erupt, creating space for their eruption.\\n\\nOption C: The zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to increase in height and length of the maxilla. \\nThis statement is incorrect. The zygomaticomaxillary suture contributes to the increase in height of the maxilla, but not its length.\\n\\nOption D: The intermaxillary suture closes about eight years postnatally. \\nThis statement is incorrect. The intermaxillary suture does not close until much later, around 15-17 years of age.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
