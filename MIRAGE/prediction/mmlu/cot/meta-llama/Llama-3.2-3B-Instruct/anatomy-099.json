    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the anatomical location and characteristics of the submandibular salivary gland. The submandibular gland is located beneath the mandible (lower jawbone), and it is a major salivary gland. Given its location, it is more likely to be palpable extraorally, as it is situated beneath the skin and muscle of the neck, rather than being confined to the oral cavity. However, it can be palpable intraorally if the gland is significantly enlarged or if there is a deviation of the tongue or floor of the mouth. Radiographical examination may also be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, especially if the gland is not easily palpable. Considering these points, the most accurate answer would be that the enlarged submandibular salivary gland is likely to be palpable extraorally.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
