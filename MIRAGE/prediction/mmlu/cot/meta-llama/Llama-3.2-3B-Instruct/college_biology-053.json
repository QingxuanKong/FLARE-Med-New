    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's consider the role of ZP3 in the fertilization process and the effects of binding ZP3 receptors on sperm. ZP3 is a glycoprotein in the zona pellucida of mouse eggs that binds to receptor proteins on the surface of mouse sperm, initiating the acrosomal reaction. This reaction is a critical step in fertilization, leading to sperm penetration of the egg. Now, let's analyze each option given in the context of this process: Option A: Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization. This would indeed be expected because if the antibodies block the binding of ZP3 to its receptors on the sperm, the acrosomal reaction would not occur, and fertilization would be blocked. Option B: Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing with eggs blocks in vitro fertilization. This is also expected because the binding of ZP3 to its receptors on the sperm is a prerequisite for the acrosomal reaction. If sperm are pre-incubated with ZP3, they would be primed for the reaction, and subsequent mixing with eggs would not be necessary for the acrosomal reaction to occur. Option C: Incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization. This option is also expected because the antibodies would block the binding of ZP3 to the sperm, preventing the acrosomal reaction and thus blocking fertilization. Option D: Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads. This option is expected because ZP2 is a different glycoprotein that does not bind to ZP3 receptors on the sperm. Since ZP3 binding is specific to ZP3 receptors, coating synthetic beads with ZP2 would not trigger the acrosomal reaction or lead to sperm aggregation on the beads. Therefore, this option does not block in vitro fertilization, making it the correct answer. Based on the role of ZP3 in the fertilization process, the expected outcome of coating synthetic beads with ZP2 is that it would not lead to sperm aggregation on the beads, as ZP2 does not bind to ZP3 receptors on the sperm.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
