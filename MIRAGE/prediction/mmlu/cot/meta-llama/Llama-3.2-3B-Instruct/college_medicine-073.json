    "question": "Mg(OH)2 is slowly dissolved in 500 mL of 25 oC water until the solution becomes fully saturated. Which of the following occurs when 10.0 mL of 0.1 M HCl is added?",
    "options": {
        "A": "MgCl2 precipitates",
        "B": "Mg(OH)2 precipitates",
        "C": "Ksp for Mg(OH)2 increases",
        "D": "[H2O] increases"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the situation step by step: 1. **Initial Conditions**: We have a solution of Mg(OH)2 dissolved in water at 25\u00b0C. The solution is initially saturated, which means the concentration of Mg2+ and OH- ions is at the equilibrium point for the dissolution of Mg(OH)2. 2. **Dissolution of Mg(OH)2**: The dissolution of Mg(OH)2 in water can be represented by the equation: Mg(OH)2 (s) \u21cc Mg2+ (aq) + 2OH- (aq) At equilibrium, the concentration of Mg2+ and OH- ions is equal to the solubility of Mg(OH)2, which is a constant value for a given temperature. 3. **Addition of HCl**: When 10.0 mL of 0.1 M HCl is added to the solution, it will increase the concentration of H+ ions in the solution. This increase in H+ concentration will lead to an increase in the concentration of OH- ions due to the autoionization of water: H2O (l) \u21cc H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) The increase in OH- concentration will lead to an increase in the concentration of Mg2+ ions due to the reaction: Mg2+ (aq) + 2OH- (aq) \u21cc Mg(OH)2 (s) 4. **Precipitation of Mg(OH)2**: Since the concentration of Mg2+ and OH- ions is increasing, the solution will eventually become supersaturated, and Mg(OH)2 will precipitate out of the solution. Now, analyzing the options: - A. MgCl2 precipitates: Incorrect, because HCl adds H+ ions, not Cl- ions, to the solution. - B. Mg(OH)2 precipitates: Correct, as explained above. - C. Ksp for Mg(OH)2 increases: Incorrect, because the Ksp (solubility product constant) of Mg(OH)2 is a constant value at a given temperature, and the increase in concentration of Mg2+ and OH- ions will actually lead to a decrease in the Ksp value, not an increase. - D. [H2O] increases: Incorrect, because the addition of HCl increases the concentration of H+ and OH- ions, but not the concentration of water (H2O) itself. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The solution becomes supersaturated, and Mg(OH)2 precipitates out of the solution due to the increase in Mg2+ and OH- ion concentrations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
