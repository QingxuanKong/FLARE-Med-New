    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking: To answer this question, let's break down the concept of alternation of generations in ferns. Alternation of generations is a life cycle in plants where two distinct generations exist: a diploid (sporophyte) generation and a haploid (gametophyte) generation. This cycle is characteristic of plants that reproduce via spores, such as ferns. The dominant generation in ferns is the sporophyte. The sporophyte is the larger, more complex generation that produces spores through meiosis, while the gametophyte is smaller and produces gametes (sperm and eggs) through mitosis. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. dominant sporophyte alternates with an independent gametophyte: In ferns, the sporophyte is indeed the dominant generation, but the gametophyte is not entirely independent. The gametophyte is actually dependent on the sporophyte for its survival and nutrition. B. dominant gametophyte alternates with a dependent sporophyte: This is incorrect, as ferns have a sporophyte-dominant life cycle, not gametophyte-dominant. C. sporophyte and a gametophyte have equal life spans: This is also incorrect, as the sporophyte is generally the longer-lived generation. D. gametophyte produces gametes by meiosis: This is incorrect, as the sporophyte produces spores through meiosis, not the gametophyte. Considering the above points, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In ferns, the dominant sporophyte generation alternates with a dependent gametophyte generation. The sporophyte is the larger, more complex generation that produces spores through meiosis, while the gametophyte is smaller and produces gametes through mitosis. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
