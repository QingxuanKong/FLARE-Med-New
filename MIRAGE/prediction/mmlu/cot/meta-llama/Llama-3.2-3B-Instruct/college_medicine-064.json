    "question": "If the mean rate of oxygen consumption of a male athlete during a training session is 2 l/min, then his rate of energy expenditure is approximately:",
    "options": {
        "A": "400 kJ/min.",
        "B": "200 kJ/min.",
        "C": "80 kJ/min.",
        "D": "40 kJ/min."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To determine the rate of energy expenditure, we need to know the specific heat of oxygen (approximately 1.005 kJ/kg\u00b7K) and the density of air (approximately 1.29 kg/m\u00b3 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure). However, since the question doesn't provide these values, we'll use the commonly accepted estimate of energy expenditure per unit of oxygen consumption for a male athlete. The energy expenditure per unit of oxygen consumption can be estimated as follows: 1 l of oxygen consumes approximately 4.76 kJ (4.76 kJ = 1 l O2 x 1.005 kJ/kg\u00b7K x 1 kg air). Now, let's calculate the energy expenditure per minute: 2 l/min x 4.76 kJ/l = 9.52 kJ/min Now, let's compare this value to the options: A. 400 kJ/min is too high. B. 200 kJ/min is approximately 20.98 times the calculated value. C. 80 kJ/min is approximately 8.46 times the calculated value. D. 40 kJ/min is approximately 4.23 times the calculated value. Since the calculated value (9.52 kJ/min) is closest to option D, but slightly higher, I will choose: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the energy expenditure, we used the estimate of 4.76 kJ/l of oxygen consumption. Multiplying this value by the oxygen consumption rate of 2 l/min, we get approximately 9.52 kJ/min. However, this value is closest to option D. 40 kJ/min, but slightly higher. Therefore, the best answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
