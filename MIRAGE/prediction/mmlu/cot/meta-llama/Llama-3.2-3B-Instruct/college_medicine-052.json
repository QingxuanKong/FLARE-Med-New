    "question": "Approximately how many kJ of energy are expended if an athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake averages 3.0 l/min for 5 minutes of exercise?",
    "options": {
        "A": "60 kJ",
        "B": "150 kJ",
        "C": "300 kJ",
        "D": "500 kJ"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this problem, we need to know the energy yield of oxygen. The energy yield of oxygen is approximately 4.8 kJ/l (kilocalories per liter). Now, we can calculate the total energy expended as follows: 1. First, we need to convert the oxygen uptake from liters per minute (l/min) to liters (l). Since the time is given in minutes, we can multiply the oxygen uptake by the time to get the total volume of oxygen taken in. Oxygen uptake (l/min) * Time (min) = Total oxygen volume (l) 3.0 l/min * 5 min = 15 l 2. Now, we can calculate the total energy expended by multiplying the total oxygen volume by the energy yield of oxygen. Total oxygen volume (l) * Energy yield of oxygen (kJ/l) = Total energy expended (kJ) 15 l * 4.8 kJ/l = 72 kJ However, this is the energy expended by the athlete. Since the question asks for the energy expended, we need to consider the energy expended by the athlete's body. The energy yield of oxygen is for the body to use, but the question asks for the energy expended. The energy expended by the body is typically 3.8 times the energy yield of oxygen, so we can multiply the total energy expended by 3.8 to get the energy expended by the body. Total energy expended (kJ) * 3.8 = Energy expended by the body (kJ) 72 kJ * 3.8 = 273.6 kJ However, the question asks for the energy expended at a \"steady-rate\" oxygen uptake. The energy expended by the body at a steady-rate oxygen uptake is typically 4 times the energy yield of oxygen, so we can multiply the total energy expended by 4 to get the energy expended at a steady-rate oxygen uptake. Total energy expended (kJ) * 4 = Energy expended at a steady-rate oxygen uptake (kJ) 72 kJ * 4 = 288 kJ Since none of the options match our calculated value, we can round our answer to the closest option. The closest option is B. 150 kJ is closest to 150 kJ, which is approximately 288 kJ, but the question asks for the \"approximate\" answer.",
