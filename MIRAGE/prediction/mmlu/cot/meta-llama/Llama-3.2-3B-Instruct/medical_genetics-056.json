    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking: Meiosis is the process of cell division that results in the production of gametes (sperm and egg cells) with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. It consists of two successive cell divisions: meiosis I and meiosis II. Recombination is the process by which genetic material is exchanged between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. This process increases genetic diversity by creating new combinations of alleles. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material through a process called crossing over. This exchange occurs before the chromosomes are separated, which is why it happens in the first meiotic division. Given this understanding, let's evaluate the options: A. Metaphase I: During metaphase I, the homologous chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate, preparing for separation. However, recombination has not occurred at this stage. B. Prophase I: In prophase I, the homologous chromosomes pair up and undergo crossing over, where genetic material is exchanged between them. This is the stage where recombination occurs. C. Metaphase II: Metaphase II is the stage of meiosis II, where the sister chromatids line up at the metaphase plate, preparing for separation. Recombination has already occurred before this stage. D. Prophase II: Prophase II is the stage of meiosis II, where the chromosomes condense and the nuclear envelope begins to break down. Recombination has already occurred before this stage. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Recombination occurs in prophase I, where homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material through crossing over.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
