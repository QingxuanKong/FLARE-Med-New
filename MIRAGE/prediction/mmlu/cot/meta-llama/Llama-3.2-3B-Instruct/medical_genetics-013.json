    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the process step by step: 1. **Understanding the condition**: Sickle-cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects hemoglobin production in red blood cells. It causes the red blood cells to become misshapen, leading to various complications. 2. **Identifying the genetic basis**: The disease is caused by a mutation in the HBB gene, which codes for the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin. 3. **Determining the type of mutation**: The mutation responsible for sickle-cell disease is a specific change in the DNA sequence of the HBB gene. 4. **Analyzing the options**: Now, let's examine the given options: - A. Deletion: A deletion involves the removal of one or more nucleotides from the DNA sequence. - B. Duplication: A duplication involves the addition of one or more nucleotides to the DNA sequence. - C. Insertion: An insertion involves the addition of one or more nucleotides into the DNA sequence. - D. Point mutation: A point mutation involves a change in a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence. 5. **Conclusion**: The mutation in sickle-cell disease involves a change in a single nucleotide, specifically a substitution of glutamic acid with valine at position 6 of the beta-globin protein. This is a classic example of a point mutation. Therefore, the answer is: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mutation in sickle-cell disease consists of a point mutation, as it involves a change in a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"} ```",
