    "question": "A 25-year-old man comes to the emergency department because he developed chest pain and shortness of breath 1 hour ago, shortly after snorting cocaine for the first time. He rates the chest pain as a 7 on a 10-point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Carvedilol",
        "B": "Furosemide",
        "C": "Metoprolol",
        "D": "Phentolamine"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with chest pain and shortness of breath after snorting cocaine, which is a vasoconstrictor. The patient's blood pressure is elevated (200/100 mmHg) and heart rate is also elevated (110/min), which is consistent with a sympathetic storm caused by the cocaine. The patient has been treated with supplemental oxygen, aspirin, nitroglycerin, and lorazepam, but continues to experience chest pain and shortness of breath. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia, but no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. The patient is fully oriented and has no signs of cardiac ischemia or acute coronary syndrome. Given the patient's presentation and the fact that the ECG does not show signs of cardiac ischemia, the most likely diagnosis is a cocaine-induced hypertensive crisis. The goal of additional pharmacotherapy is to control the blood pressure and heart rate. Phentolamine is a \\u00b1-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist that can effectively block the effects of cocaine and reduce blood pressure and heart rate. Carvedilol is a beta-blocker that can also reduce blood pressure and heart rate, but it may not be as effective in this scenario as phentolamine. Furosemide is a diuretic that would not be appropriate in this scenario as the patient is already hyperventilated and diaphoretic. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can also reduce heart rate, but it may not be as effective as phentolamine in this scenario as the patient's blood pressure is primarily elevated due to vasoconstriction rather than tachycardia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
