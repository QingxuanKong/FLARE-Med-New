    "question": "A 36-year-old man comes to the office because of headaches that began 2 weeks ago. The headaches are moderately severe, are present when he awakens in the morning, and are relieved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has no prior history of headaches. He tells you he was promoted to an upper-level managerial position in his accounting firm about 8 months ago, which necessitated relocating. Physical examination now discloses no abnormalities except for blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Begin a trial of a \u03b2-blocking medication",
        "B": "Order CT scan of the head",
        "C": "Order EEG",
        "D": "Refer him for consultation with a neurologist"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's symptoms of moderately severe headaches that are present in the morning and relieved with over-the-counter analgesics, we should consider the possibility of a tension headache or possibly a migraines, which are common conditions that can be exacerbated by stress. The patient's recent promotion and relocation could be a potential stressor. The blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally is a concerning finding that could indicate optic nerve compression or demyelination, which could be related to multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the patient has no prior history of MS. Given the acute presentation and the need for further evaluation, a non-invasive and quick test would be the most appropriate next step. A CT scan of the head is a reasonable choice to rule out other potential causes of the optic disc changes, such as a tumor or an aneurysm. This test is quick, relatively inexpensive, and can provide valuable information to guide further management. A trial of a \u03b2-blocking medication may be premature without further evaluation, and referring the patient for consultation with a neurologist may be necessary at a later stage, but is not the most appropriate next step. An EEG is not directly relevant to the patient's symptoms and findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
