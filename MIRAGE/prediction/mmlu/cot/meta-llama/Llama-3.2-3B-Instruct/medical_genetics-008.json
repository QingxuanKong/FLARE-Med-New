    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder characterized by the inability of the body to break down an amino acid called phenylalanine. If left untreated, PKU can lead to intellectual disability and other serious health problems. The risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU is a crucial consideration in counseling and management of the family. To determine the risk, we need to consider the mode of inheritance of PKU, which is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that a child needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the disease. If the mother is a carrier of the mutated gene but does not express the disease herself (heterozygous), the risk of passing the mutated gene to her offspring is 25%. However, if the mother is homozygous for the mutated gene (has two copies of the mutated gene), the risk of passing the disease to her offspring is 100%. Since the question does not provide information on the mother's genotype, we can assume that she is a carrier of the mutated gene (heterozygous). Therefore, the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU is 25%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
