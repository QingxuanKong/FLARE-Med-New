    "question": "A healthy 22-year-old man participates in a study of glucose metabolism. At the beginning of the study, his serum glucose concentration is within the reference range. He consumes an 800-calorie meal consisting of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. He then sleeps through the night without additional food or drink. Twelve hours later, his serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely involved in maintaining this man's serum glucose concentration?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal",
        "B": "Glucose release from skeletal muscle",
        "C": "Glycogenolysis in the liver",
        "D": "Increased leptin release from adipose tissues"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the scenario step by step: 1. **Initial Situation**: The man consumes an 800-calorie meal containing protein, fat, and carbohydrates. This meal would cause a rise in serum glucose concentration due to the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, which would be stored in the liver as glycogen and/or released into the bloodstream. 2. **Post-Meal Glucose Levels**: After consuming the meal, the serum glucose concentration would likely peak within a few hours, depending on the individual's metabolic rate and insulin sensitivity. However, this peak is not the focus of the question. 3. **Sleep and No Additional Food/Drink**: The man sleeps for 12 hours without any additional food or drink. This means that the body has had time to clear out the excess glucose from the bloodstream. 4. **Reference Range at 12 Hours**: The question states that his serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range at 12 hours after the meal. This implies that the body has effectively cleared the glucose from the bloodstream. Considering these points, let's evaluate the options: A. **Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal**: While some glucose is still being absorbed from the meal, this would not be enough to maintain the serum glucose concentration within the reference range for 12 hours. The body would have already cleared out the majority of the glucose from the bloodstream. B. **Glucose release from skeletal muscle**: Skeletal muscle does store glycogen, which can be broken down into glucose and released into the bloodstream. However, the primary storage site for glucose in the body is the liver, and the liver's glycogen stores are depleted within 12 hours. C. **Glycogenolysis in the liver**: The liver's glycogen stores are depleted within 12 hours, as mentioned above. However, the liver also has another mechanism to maintain blood glucose levels: glycogenolysis can be inhibited, and the liver can also store glucose as glycogen or release it into the bloodstream as glucose. The liver also has a mechanism to store glucose as glucose-6-phosphate, which can be converted back to glucose and released into the bloodstream. D. **Increased leptin release from adipose tissues**: Leptin is a hormone that helps regulate energy balance and body weight. While leptin can influence glucose metabolism, its primary role is not in maintaining serum glucose concentration. Considering these points, the most likely mechanism involved in maintaining the man's serum glucose concentration within the reference range is glycogenolysis in the liver. The liver can store glucose as glycogen and release it into the bloodstream as glucose, which helps maintain blood glucose levels within a normal range. **Answer Choice:** C. Glycogenolysis in the liver",
