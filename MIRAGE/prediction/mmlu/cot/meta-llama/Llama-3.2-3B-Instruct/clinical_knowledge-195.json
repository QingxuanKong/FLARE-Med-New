    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the type of joint the elbow is, let's first consider the characteristics of each type of joint mentioned in the options.\\n\\nA ball and socket joint (A) allows for rotational movement in multiple planes and is typically found in the shoulder and hip joints. This doesn't seem to match the elbow's primary function.\\n\\nA fused joint (B) is a joint where the bones are permanently joined together, resulting in limited movement. This also doesn't seem to fit the elbow's primary function.\\n\\nA synovial hinge joint (C) allows for movement in one plane, typically flexion and extension. The elbow joint fits this description as it allows for flexion (bending) and extension (straightening) of the forearm.\\n\\nA plain joint (D) is not a standard term in anatomy, but it might be referring to a synovial joint. Since we've already identified the elbow as a synovial hinge joint, this option is redundant.\\n\\nConsidering these characteristics, the elbow joint is best described as a synovial hinge joint.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
