    "question": "A 10-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because her school nurse thinks that she may have Marfan syndrome. She is at the 95th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows a narrow palate with dental crowding, long slender extremities, and joint laxity. Molecular testing for FBN1 shows a single nucleotide difference that does not change the amino acid at that locus. Her mother is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall. There is no clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome in the mother, but she has the same single nucleotide change as the patient. The same nucleotide change is found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome. Which of the following best describes the single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother?",
    "options": {
        "A": "It is a disease-causing mutation in the patient and her mother",
        "B": "It is a polymorphism",
        "C": "It is a sequence variant of unknown significance",
        "D": "It will change the folding of the protein"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The girl has a narrow palate, dental crowding, long slender extremities, and joint laxity, which are characteristic features of Marfan syndrome. However, she is at the 95th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight, which could suggest that she might not have the full-blown syndrome. 2. **Molecular Testing**: The molecular testing for FBN1 (the gene responsible for Marfan syndrome) shows a single nucleotide difference. However, this difference does not change the amino acid at that locus. This suggests that the mutation might not be a frameshift mutation or a nonsense mutation, which would typically cause a significant change in the protein structure. 3. **Family History**: The mother is also a carrier of the same single nucleotide change, and it is found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome. This indicates that the mutation is not rare and might be a common polymorphism. 4. **Population Frequency**: The fact that the mutation is found in 15 out of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome suggests that it is a relatively common polymorphism. Considering these points, the correct answer can be deduced as follows: - **Option A** is incorrect because the mutation does not change the amino acid at that locus, so it is unlikely to be a disease-causing mutation. - **Option D** is incorrect because the mutation does not change the amino acid sequence, so it will not change the folding of the protein. - **Option C** is incorrect because the mutation is relatively common and found in a significant number of individuals without Marfan syndrome, so it is unlikely to be of unknown significance. - **Option B** is the correct answer because the mutation is a polymorphism, a common genetic variation that does not typically cause disease. Therefore, the output in json format is: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient and her mother have a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the FBN1 gene. The SNP is relatively common, found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome, and does not change the amino acid sequence. Therefore, it is classified as a polymorphism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"} ```",
