    "options": {
        "A": "Androgen insensitivity",
        "B": "Campomelic dysplasia",
        "C": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia",
        "D": "Klinefelter syndrome"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. **Understanding the condition**: Female pseudohermaphroditism refers to a condition where an individual has both ovarian and testicular tissue, or ambiguous genitalia that does not clearly fit the typical female or male classification. This can occur due to various genetic or hormonal factors. 2. **Analyzing option A: Androgen insensitivity**: This condition is characterized by the inability of cells to respond to androgens, resulting in the development of female external genitalia despite the presence of testes. Individuals with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) are genetically male (46,XY) but have a female phenotype due to the lack of response to androgens. This condition indeed causes female pseudohermaphroditism. 3. **Analyzing option B: Campomelic dysplasia**: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects bone development, leading to short stature and other skeletal abnormalities. While it can cause genital abnormalities, it is not typically associated with the development of both ovarian and testicular tissue, nor is it primarily known for causing female pseudohermaphroditism. 4. **Analyzing option C: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)**: This condition is caused by a deficiency of an enzyme necessary for cortisol production, leading to an overproduction of androgens. While CAH can cause virilization of female external genitalia, it does not typically result in the presence of both ovarian and testicular tissue. 5. **Analyzing option D: Klinefelter syndrome**: This genetic condition occurs in males with an extra X chromosome (47,XXY), leading to tall stature, infertility, and other physical characteristics. While it affects male development, it does not cause female pseudohermaphroditism. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the condition that causes female pseudohermaphroditism is androgen insensitivity, as it results in the development of both ovarian and testicular tissue in genetically male individuals. **Output in JSON format**: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The condition that causes female pseudohermaphroditism is androgen insensitivity due to the inability of cells to respond to androgens, resulting in the development of both ovarian and testicular tissue in genetically male individuals.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" } ```",
