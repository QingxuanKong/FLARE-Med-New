    "options": {
        "A": "Calcitonin causes a rise in plasma calcium",
        "B": "Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic",
        "C": "Vitamin D is secreted by the parathyroid glands",
        "D": "Oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the question: 1. **Understanding the options**: - Calcitonin is a hormone that regulates calcium levels in the blood. Its primary function is to decrease blood calcium levels, not increase them. - Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition where one or more of the parathyroid glands are overactive, leading to an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) production. This typically results in hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels). However, it's not always asymptomatic. - Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium absorption from the gut, but it is not secreted by the parathyroid glands. Instead, it is produced in the skin in response to sunlight and then processed in the liver and kidneys. - Oliguria (reduced urine production) can be a symptom of hypercalcemia, as the kidneys have difficulty excreting excess calcium, leading to a concentration of calcium in the blood. 2. **Analyzing each option**: - A: Calcitonin decreases blood calcium levels, so it does not cause a rise in plasma calcium. - B: While primary hyperparathyroidism may not always be symptomatic, it is not typically asymptomatic. The symptoms can vary, but they often include bone pain, kidney stones, and gastrointestinal issues. - C: Vitamin D is produced in the skin in response to sunlight, not secreted by the parathyroid glands. - D: Oliguria is indeed a symptom of hypercalcemia, as the kidneys struggle to excrete excess calcium. 3. **Choosing the correct answer**: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is D. Oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcemia. Here's the response in the required json format: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Analyzing each option, we can determine that calcitonin decreases blood calcium levels, primary hyperparathyroidism is usually symptomatic, and vitamin D is produced in the skin, not secreted by the parathyroid glands.
