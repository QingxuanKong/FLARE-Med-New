    "question": "After being severely beaten and sustaining a gunshot wound to the abdomen, a 42-year-old woman undergoes resection of a perforated small bowel. During the operation, plastic reconstruction of facial fractures, and open reduction and internal fixation of the left femur are also done. Thirty-six hours postoperatively, she is awake but not completely alert. She is receiving intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled pump. She says that she needs the morphine to treat her pain, but she is worried that she is becoming addicted. She has no history of substance use disorder. She drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly. Which of the following initial actions by the physician is most appropriate?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Reassure the patient that her chance of becoming addicted to narcotics is minuscule",
        "B": "Maintain the morphine, but periodically administer intravenous naloxone",
        "C": "Switch the patient to oral acetaminophen as soon as she can take medication orally",
        "D": "Switch the patient to intramuscular lorazepam"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To address the patient's concerns about addiction, it is essential to consider the context of her situation. She has recently undergone a major surgery with multiple injuries, and she is receiving pain management with morphine, which is a common practice in postoperative care. The patient's lack of history of substance use disorder and limited alcohol consumption (1-2 glasses of wine per week) also suggest a lower risk of addiction. However, it is crucial to monitor her pain management and adjust as needed to minimize the risk of dependence. Switching to oral acetaminophen or lorazepam may not be the best initial approach, as these alternatives may not provide adequate pain relief for her specific situation. Periodic administration of naloxone is not necessary in this case, as it is primarily used to reverse opioid overdose, which is not indicated here. Reassuring the patient that her chance of addiction is minuscule may be reassuring but does not address the potential risks of dependence and tolerance. The most appropriate initial action is to maintain the current pain management regimen and closely monitor her response to the morphine, adjusting as needed to optimize pain control while minimizing the risk of dependence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
