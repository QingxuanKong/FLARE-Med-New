    "question": "Which of the following allows gas exchange in the lungs?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Alveoli",
        "B": "Bronchi",
        "C": "Bronchioles",
        "D": "Capillaries"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking: To answer this question, let's consider the structure and function of each option given: 1. **Alveoli**: These are tiny air sacs located at the end of the bronchioles in the lungs. Their primary function is to facilitate gas exchange - oxygen diffuses into the blood and carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood. This process is crucial for oxygenating the blood and removing carbon dioxide. 2. **Bronchi**: These are larger airways that branch off from the trachea (windpipe) and lead to the lungs. Their main function is to conduct air to the alveoli, but they do not facilitate gas exchange. 3. **Bronchioles**: These are smaller airways that branch off from the bronchi. Like the bronchi, their primary function is to conduct air to the alveoli, but they do not facilitate gas exchange. 4. **Capillaries**: These are tiny blood vessels that allow for the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the blood and tissues. While they are crucial for overall circulation and do play a role in gas exchange, they are not the primary site for gas exchange in the lungs. Given the specific context of the question, the correct answer is the one directly involved in gas exchange: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary function of each option is as follows: Alveoli facilitate gas exchange, while bronchi and bronchioles conduct air and capillaries facilitate circulation. Therefore, the correct answer is the one directly involved in gas exchange.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
