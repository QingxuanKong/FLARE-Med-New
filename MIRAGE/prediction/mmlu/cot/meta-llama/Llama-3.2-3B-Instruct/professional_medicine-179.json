    "question": "A 37-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-day history of throbbing facial pain. She describes the pain as 7 out of 10 in intensity. Over the past 9 days, she has had nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, sore throat, and a nonproductive cough. She does not smoke. Her husband and children have had no recent illness. Her temperature is 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F). Examination shows congested nasal mucosa and purulent discharge on the left. There is tenderness to palpation over the left cheek and no transillumination over the left maxillary sinus. The tympanic membranes are normal, and there is no erythema of the throat. Examination shows no cervical adenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Haemophilus influenzae type b",
        "B": "Moraxella catarrhalis",
        "C": "Staphylococcus aureus",
        "D": "Streptococcus pneumoniae"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely causal organism, let's break down the patient's symptoms and examination findings: 1. The patient presents with throbbing facial pain, nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, sore throat, and a nonproductive cough, which suggests an upper respiratory tract infection (URT). 2. The presence of purulent nasal discharge and tenderness to palpation over the left cheek indicates involvement of the left maxillary sinus. 3. The lack of fever in the oropharynx (normal tympanic membranes and no erythema of the throat) and the absence of cervical adenopathy suggest that the infection is not caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (which is often associated with pharyngitis and cervical lymphadenopathy). 4. The patient's age and the absence of any risk factors for otitis media (e.g., Eustachian tube dysfunction) make Haemophilus influenzae type b less likely. 5. The presence of purulent nasal discharge and maxillary sinus tenderness is more consistent with an infection of the maxillary sinus, which is a common site for Moraxella catarrhalis infection. 6. Staphylococcus aureus can cause sinusitis, but it is less commonly associated with the combination of symptoms presented in this case. Based on these considerations, Moraxella catarrhalis is the most likely causal organism, as it is a common cause of acute bacterial sinusitis and upper respiratory tract infections, and the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
