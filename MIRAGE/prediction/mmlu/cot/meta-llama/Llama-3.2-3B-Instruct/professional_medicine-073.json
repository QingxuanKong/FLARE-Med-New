    "question": "A 23-year-old woman with bone marrow failure is treated with a large dose of rabbit antithymocyte globulin. Ten days later, she develops fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and erythema on her hands and feet. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Cytokine secretion by natural killer cells",
        "B": "Eosinophil degranulation",
        "C": "Immune complex deposition in tissues",
        "D": "Polyclonal T-lymphocyte activation"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the side effects of rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and the symptoms presented by the patient. ATG is an immunosuppressive therapy used to treat bone marrow failure, particularly in preparation for bone marrow transplantation. It works by depleting T-lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell involved in the immune response. However, this immunosuppression can lead to an increased risk of certain complications, including the development of an immune response against the ATG itself.\\n\\nThe symptoms presented by the patient, such as fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and erythema on her hands and feet, are indicative of an immune reaction. Given the context of ATG treatment, we need to consider what could trigger this immune response.\\n\\nOption A, cytokine secretion by natural killer cells, is unlikely to be the primary cause of these symptoms. Natural killer cells are part of the innate immune response and are not typically associated with the symptoms presented.\\n\\nOption B, eosinophil degranulation, is also unlikely. Eosinophils are involved in allergic reactions and parasitic infections, which do not match the symptoms presented in this case.\\n\\nOption D, polyclonal T-lymphocyte activation, is a possible cause, but it is not the most likely explanation. While ATG does deplete T-lymphocytes, the symptoms presented suggest an immune response against the ATG itself, rather than a polyclonal T-lymphocyte activation.\\n\\nOption C, immune complex deposition in tissues, is the most likely cause. ATG can cause the formation of immune complexes, which are deposits of antibodies and antigens that can trigger an immune response. This is a common side effect of ATG treatment and matches the symptoms presented by the patient. The immune complexes can deposit in tissues, leading to inflammation and the symptoms observed.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is immune complex deposition in tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
