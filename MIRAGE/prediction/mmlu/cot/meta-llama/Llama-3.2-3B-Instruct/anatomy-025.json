    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's consider the composition of exhaled air. Exhaled air is a mixture of gases that are expelled from the lungs after inhalation. The main components of exhaled air are water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and oxygen. Water vapor is present in the air we breathe, but its quantity is relatively small compared to the other components. Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of cellular respiration and is present in the blood and tissues. Nitrogen is a major component of the air we breathe, making up about 78% of the atmosphere. Oxygen is also a major component of the air we breathe, making up about 21%. Considering the composition of exhaled air, we can expect that the quantity of nitrogen would be greater than the other options. However, we need to consider the quantity of each substance in the context of exhaled air. Exhaled air is about 12-15% carbon dioxide, 3-4% oxygen, and 78-80% nitrogen. Therefore, the substance found in greater quantity in exhaled air is nitrogen.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
