    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down the types of covalent bonds that form in proteins. First, we need to understand the structure of proteins and how amino acids are linked together. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and they contain an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a side chain. When two amino acids are linked together, a covalent bond forms between the amino group of one amino acid and the carboxyl group of another amino acid. This type of bond is known as a peptide bond. Next, we need to consider the other options. Hydrogen bonds are weak electrostatic attractions between molecules, not covalent bonds. Ionic bonds involve the transfer of electrons between atoms, which is not the case in protein structure. Glycosidic bonds are a type of covalent bond that links sugars together, but they are not the primary bonds that link amino acids in proteins. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that describes the specific type of covalent bond that links amino acids together.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
