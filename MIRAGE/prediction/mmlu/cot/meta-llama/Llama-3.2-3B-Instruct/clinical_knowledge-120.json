    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the possible causes of acute urinary retention. Acute urinary retention is a sudden inability to urinate, which can be a medical emergency if not addressed promptly. Let's evaluate each option: 1. Haematuria (A) refers to the presence of blood in the urine, which can be a symptom of various conditions, but it is not a direct cause of acute urinary retention. 2. Bladder outflow obstruction (B) is a condition where the flow of urine out of the bladder is blocked, which can lead to a buildup of urine and cause acute urinary retention. This is a common cause of acute urinary retention. 3. Drinking alcohol (C) can lead to urinary retention, but it is not the most common cause of acute urinary retention. Alcohol can relax the muscles in the urethra, making it more difficult to urinate, but this is not as significant a cause as other factors. 4. Kidney stones (D) can cause urinary retention, but they are not the most common cause of acute urinary retention. Kidney stones can cause pain and discomfort while urinating, but they are not typically associated with sudden inability to urinate. Considering these factors, the most likely cause of acute urinary retention is bladder outflow obstruction, which can block the flow of urine out of the bladder, leading to a buildup of urine and sudden inability to urinate.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
