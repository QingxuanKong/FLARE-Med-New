    "question": "A 17-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being found with a \"blank stare\" and flat facial expression at a party. His pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 104/68 mm Hg. He is sitting upright and appears catatonic. Physical examination shows rigidity. During the examination, he becomes hostile and attempts to assault the physician. This patient most likely ingested which of the following drugs?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Diazepam",
        "B": "Methamphetamine",
        "C": "Oxycodone",
        "D": "PCP (phencyclidine)"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with a \"blank stare,\" flat facial expression, catatonia, rigidity, and hostility. This combination of symptoms is highly suggestive of a severe psychotropic effect. 2. **Duration of Onset**: The symptoms started 30 minutes ago, which indicates an acute onset. 3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The presence of rigidity is particularly notable, as it is a key feature of certain types of substance-induced catatonia. 4. **Potential Causes**: Considering the acute onset and specific symptoms, we need to think about substances that can cause catatonia, especially those with a rapid onset. 5. **Options Analysis**: - **A. Diazepam**: While diazepam can cause sedation and catatonia, it's less likely to cause the level of hostility and rigidity described. - **B. Methamphetamine**: Methamphetamine typically causes agitation, increased energy, and hyperactivity, rather than catatonia. - **C. Oxycodone**: Oxycodone can cause sedation, but it's less likely to cause the severe psychotropic effects and rigidity described. - **D. PCP (Phencyclidine)**: PCP is a dissociative anesthetic that can cause catatonia, hallucinations, and a \"blank stare.\" It's known for its rapid onset and severe psychotropic effects, including aggression and hostility. 6. **Conclusion**: Based on the clinical presentation and the options provided, PCP (Phencyclidine) is the most likely substance that the patient ingested. Here's the answer in the requested format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's clinical presentation of catatonia, rigidity, hostility, and rapid onset after a social setting makes PCP (Phencyclidine) the most likely substance ingested. The other options do not match the severity and type of symptoms presented.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
