    "question": "A 16-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because she is concerned that she may have contracted meningitis from her soccer teammate, who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis and admitted to the hospital yesterday. The patient's soccer team traveled to a neighboring state to participate in a tournament 1 week ago and she shared a hotel room with the girl who was hospitalized. The patient feels well but is concerned she may have \"caught the same bug.\" Medical history is remarkable for asthma. Medications include inhaled albuterol. Vital signs are temperature 37.2\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F), pulse 64/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 107/58 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention for this patient at this time?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Administer the meningococcal vaccine",
        "B": "Prescribe doxycycline",
        "C": "Prescribe penicillin",
        "D": "Prescribe rifampin"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this case, we need to consider the patient's symptoms, medical history, and the incubation period of the disease. The patient is concerned about contracting meningococcal meningitis after being in close proximity to her teammate who was hospitalized with the disease. However, the patient is asymptomatic and has no risk factors for severe disease. The incubation period of Neisseria meningitidis, the causative organism of meningococcal meningitis, is typically 2-10 days. Since the teammate was admitted to the hospital 1 week ago, the patient is unlikely to have contracted the disease recently. Given the patient's asymptomatic status and lack of risk factors, the primary concern is the potential for post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent the spread of the disease to others, particularly her teammates and family members who may be at higher risk of severe disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for close contacts of individuals with meningococcal disease, including those who share a living space with the patient. The recommended PEP regimen includes rifampin for 3 days. The other options are not indicated for this patient's situation. The meningococcal vaccine is not effective as post-exposure prophylaxis, doxycycline is not recommended for meningococcal disease, and penicillin is not the preferred treatment for meningococcal meningitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
