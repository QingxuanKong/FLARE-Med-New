    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. The son is the subject of the story. We need to determine the type of mobility in relation to the son. 2. The son moves from his current position (presumably a college student or a young adult) to a new position (becoming a teacher at a medical school). This is an example of intragenerational mobility, as it involves a change in the son's position within his own generation. 3. The son then gets promoted to a tenured professor position, which is also an example of intragenerational mobility, as he is moving up the career ladder within his own generation. 4. The son moves across the country for a new tenured professor position at a different school. This is an example of intergenerational mobility, as it involves a change in the son's position across different generations (he is moving from one generation of parents to the next, as his children may benefit from his career advancement). Now, let's analyze the options: - A. intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, horizontal mobility, horizontal mobility: This option is incorrect because the son's career advancement is not related to his father. - B. intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, upward mobility, upward mobility: This option is partially correct, but it does not account for the intergenerational mobility. - C. intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, upward mobility, horizontal mobility: This option is incorrect because the son's career advancement is not related to his father. - D. intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, horizontal mobility, upward mobility: This option is correct, as the son experiences intragenerational mobility (moving within his own generation) and upward mobility (moving up the career ladder). The final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The son's career advancement involves intragenerational mobility (moving within his own generation) and upward mobility (moving up the career ladder), while the change in location is an example of intergenerational mobility (across different generations).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
