    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the findings from experiments on song development in birds. The key observation here is that when a young male bird is reared in isolation and only hears the song of a different bird species, he develops an adult song repertoire that lacks certain characteristics typical of his own species. This suggests that the song of his species is not entirely innate or instinctive, as the young bird is able to learn and mimic the songs of other species. However, the fact that the resulting song lacks certain characteristics of his own species implies that there is some innate component to song development. The fact that the young bird is not able to develop a song that is typical of his own species when isolated from his own species suggests that the song is not entirely learned during development, as he is not exposed to the songs of his own species. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the song is both instinctive and learned.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
