RNA (Ribonucleic acid) is a type of nucleic acid that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis and other cellular processes. It is composed of four nucleotide bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Uracil (U).\\n\\nThe question asks which of the given options is not found in RNA. We can immediately rule out options B (Adenine) and D (Guanine) because both are present in RNA.\\n\\nNow, let's look at options A (Thymine) and C (Uracil). Thymine is actually found in DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid), not RNA. In RNA, Uracil replaces Thymine. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that corresponds to Thymine.\\n\\nSo, the correct answer is A. Thymine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
