    "question": "In garden peas, the allele for tall plants (D) is completely dominant to the allele for dwarf plants (d) and the allele for violet flower color (W) is completely dominant to the allele for white flower color (w). In a cross between a tall violet plant, with the genotype DDWw, and a dwarf white plant, what phenotypic ratio of the progeny would be expected from this cross?",

        "A": "All tall violet",
        "B": "1 tall violet: 1 dwarf violet",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the genetic interactions between the alleles. Since the allele for tall plants (D) is dominant to the allele for dwarf plants (d) and the allele for violet flower color (W) is dominant to the allele for white flower color (w), we can break down the possible genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring. Given the parent genotypes: - The tall violet plant has the genotype DDWw. - The dwarf white plant has the genotype ddww. Now, let's consider the possible genotypes of the offspring: 1. Tall violet plant (DDWw) can contribute the D allele and W allele to the offspring. 2. Dwarf white plant (ddww) can contribute the d allele and w allele to the offspring. Since the D allele is dominant over d, and W is dominant over w, we can predict the genotypes of the offspring as follows: - The probability of an offspring inheriting the D allele from the tall parent is 1 (since the tall parent always contributes the D allele). - The probability of an offspring inheriting the d allele from the dwarf parent is 1 (since the dwarf parent always contributes the d allele). - The probability of an offspring inheriting the W allele from the tall parent is 1 (since the tall parent always contributes the W allele). - The probability of an offspring inheriting the w allele from the dwarf parent is 1 (since the dwarf parent always contributes the w allele). Now, let's consider the possible combinations: - DDWw x ddww can produce the following genotypes: DDWw (tall violet), DdwW (tall violet), Ddww (tall violet), and ddWw (dwarf violet). - ddww x DDWw can produce the following genotypes: ddWw (dwarf violet), dDwW (dwarf violet), dDww (dwarf violet), and ddww (dwarf white). Given the possible genotypes, we can predict the phenotypes: - Tall violet: DDWw, DdwW, Ddww - Dwarf violet: ddWw, dDwW, dDww - Tall white is not possible since the W allele is dominant over w. - Dwarf white: ddww Now, let's count the phenotypic ratio: - Tall violet: 3 - Dwarf violet: 3 - Tall white: 0 - Dwarf white: 1 So, the phenotypic ratio of the progeny would be: 3:3:0:1 or 3:3:1:1. However, since this answer is not available in the options, we need to re-examine the question. The correct answer should be a ratio of 3:1 or 4:1 for the tall violet and dwarf violet phenotypes, but the question asks for a ratio of 1:1 for the tall violet and dwarf violet phenotypes. Considering the possible genotypes and phenotypes, the only way to achieve a 1:1 ratio is if the tall violet and dwarf violet phenotypes are produced by the same genotype. The only genotype that can produce both tall violet and dwarf violet is DdwW, which is a heterozygous genotype for the tall and dwarf traits. However, this genotype (DdwW) is not present in the possible genotypes listed. But, looking at the genotypes again, we can see that ddww x DDWw can produce the following genotypes: ddWw (dwarf violet), dDwW (dwarf violet), dDww (dwarf violet), and ddww (dwarf white). Since ddww is the only genotype that can produce the dwarf violet phenotype and it's not possible to get a 1:1 ratio with the given genotypes, we can assume that the question has a mistake. However, if we consider the genotypes that can produce the tall violet and dwarf violet phenotypes, we can see that the correct answer is not available in the options. But we can use the options to deduce the correct answer. Looking at the options, we can see that option C (1 tall violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white) can be achieved by the following genotypes: - ddww x DDWw can produce the following genotypes: ddWw (dwarf violet), dDwW (dwarf violet), dDww (dwarf violet), and ddww (dwarf white). - ddww x DDWw can produce the following genotypes: ddWw (dwarf violet), dDwW (dwarf violet), dDww (dwarf violet), and ddww (dwarf white). So, the correct answer is C (1 tall violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white).",
