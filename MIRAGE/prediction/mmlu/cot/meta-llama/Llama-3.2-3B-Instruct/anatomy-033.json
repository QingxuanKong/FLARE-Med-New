While a patient lying face down may be on their back, the term 'dorsal' specifically describes the posterior aspect of the body, not the face-down position.\\n\\nOption B, Erect, refers to an upright position, which is the opposite of lying face down. Patients lying face down are not in an erect position.\\n\\nOption C, Lateral, means 'to the side'. This position refers to the side of the body, not the face-down position.\\n\\nOption D, Prone, directly translates to 'lying face down'. This is the correct position when a patient is lying on their stomach with their face down.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Prone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
