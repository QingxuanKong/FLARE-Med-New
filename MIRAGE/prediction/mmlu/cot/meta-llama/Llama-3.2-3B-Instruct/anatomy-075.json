    "question": "A patient cuts a peripheral motor nerve in their wrist when they fall through a plate glass window. If the nerve does not regenerate, after about 6 months the muscles it normally innervates will show signs of which of the four options below?",
    "options": {
        "A": "spastic paralysis",
        "B": "flaccid paralysis",
        "C": "atrophy",
        "D": "contracture"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to understand the concept of nerve regeneration and muscle response to denervation. When a peripheral motor nerve is cut, the muscle it innervates will initially experience a period of denervation atrophy, where the muscle fibers atrophy due to the lack of nerve supply. However, after a certain period, the muscle will undergo a process called reinnervation, where the remaining muscle fibers may be re-innervated by other nerves or may undergo atrophy and die. The timeframe for reinnervation varies depending on the type of nerve and muscle. In general, it can take several months to several years for muscle atrophy to become apparent. In the case of a cut peripheral motor nerve, muscle atrophy is a common outcome if the nerve does not regenerate. Therefore, after 6 months, the muscles that were normally innervated by the cut nerve will likely show signs of atrophy if the nerve does not regenerate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
