    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the options step by step: 1. **Understanding SARMs**: Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) are a class of compounds that are designed to target androgen receptors in the body. Androgen receptors are proteins that respond to androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which are male sex hormones. 2. **Nature of SARMs**: SARMs are not steroids, which are a class of hormones that are produced naturally in the body or can be synthesized. The key characteristic of steroids is that they are derived from cholesterol and have a steroid structure. SARMs, however, are not derived from cholesterol and do not have a steroid structure. 3. **Action of SARMs on Androgen Receptors**: SARMs are designed to interact with androgen receptors, but they do not act like natural steroid hormones. Instead, they either mimic or block the effects of natural steroid hormones on these receptors. The term \"selective\" in SARMs indicates that they have a preference for certain androgen receptors over others, which is not a characteristic of natural steroid hormones. 4. **Analyzing the Options**: - A: This option suggests that SARMs mimic the effects of natural steroid hormones, which is partially true, but it does not specify that they are not steroids themselves. - B: This option states that SARMs antagonize the effects of natural steroid hormones, which is not accurate. SARMs can either mimic or block the effects of natural steroid hormones, but antagonizing is not the primary action. - C: This option states that SARMs are non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones. This aligns with the understanding that SARMs are not steroids but can mimic the effects of natural steroid hormones on androgen receptors. - D: This option states that SARMs inhibit the effects of natural steroid hormones, which is not accurate. SARMs can either mimic or block the effects, but inhibition is not the primary action. Based on the step-by-step analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"SARMs are non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
