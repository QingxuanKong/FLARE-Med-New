    "question": "A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of recurrent, widespread blister formation. Physical examination shows lesions that are most numerous in the flexural areas including the axillae and groin. The blisters do not break easily, and there are no oral lesions. These blisters are most likely the result of adhesion failure involving which of the following?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Basement membrane",
        "B": "Dermal papillae",
        "C": "Langerhans cells",
        "D": "Melanocytes"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's presentation and the characteristics of the blisters.\\n\\nThe patient presents with recurrent, widespread blister formation that is most numerous in the flexural areas (such as the axillae and groin), which suggests a condition known as intraepidermal or subepidermal blistering. The blisters are not easily broken, indicating that they are not superficial or vesicular.\\n\\nGiven the location and characteristics of the blisters, we can consider a few possible causes. The most likely cause is a condition known as Darier's disease or keratosis follicularis, which is a genetic disorder that affects the skin and is characterized by blistering lesions, particularly in flexural areas.\\n\\nIn Darier's disease, the blisters are thought to result from adhesion failure between the epidermis and the dermis, specifically between the epidermis and the dermal papillae.\\n\\nConsidering the options provided, the most likely answer is B. Dermal papillae, as it is the structure most likely to be involved in the adhesion failure leading to blister formation in Darier's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
