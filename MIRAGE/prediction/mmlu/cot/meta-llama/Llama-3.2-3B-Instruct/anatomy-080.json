    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to identify the mucus-producing glands located on each side of the vaginal opening. Let's evaluate each option given: A. Adrenal glands: These glands are located on top of the kidneys and are responsible for producing hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol. They are not related to the reproductive system or the vaginal opening. B. Bartholin's glands: These glands are also known as Bartholin's ducts or greater vestibular glands. They are located on each side of the vaginal opening and produce mucus to help lubricate the vagina. C. Bulbourethral glands: These glands are located in the male urethra and produce a clear, watery secretion that helps to lubricate the urethra. They are not related to the female reproductive system. D. Corpus luteum: This is a temporary endocrine structure in the female ovaries that produces progesterone after ovulation. While it is part of the female reproductive system, it is not located on the vaginal opening and does not produce mucus. Based on the information, the correct answer is the gland that produces mucus and is located on each side of the vaginal opening.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
