    "options": {
        "A": "Avoids the concern for reversion to virulence",
        "B": "Develops more rapid protective immunity",
        "C": "Is less likely to require subsequent boosters for lifelong immunity",
        "D": "Is most likely to generate mucosal immunity"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for the newly identified virus, let's analyze each option step by step:\\n\\nOption A: Avoids the concern for reversion to virulence. This is a valid concern when working with live vaccines, as there is a risk that the attenuated virus could revert to its virulent form. However, this is not a unique advantage of killed vaccines.\\n\\nOption B: Develops more rapid protective immunity. Killed vaccines typically take longer to induce immunity compared to live vaccines, as they require the immune system to process the inactivated virus. This option does not seem to be the best rationale for a killed vaccine.\\n\\nOption C: Is less likely to require subsequent boosters for lifelong immunity. Killed vaccines often require booster shots to maintain immunity, as the immune response is typically shorter-lived. This option could be a strong rationale for a killed vaccine, as it may provide a more predictable and sustained immunity.\\n\\nOption D: Is most likely to generate mucosal immunity. Mucosal immunity is typically associated with live vaccines, which can target the mucous membranes and provide protection against infections at the site of entry. Killed vaccines, on the other hand, are generally not effective at generating mucosal immunity.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for this illness is that it is less likely to require subsequent boosters for lifelong immunity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
