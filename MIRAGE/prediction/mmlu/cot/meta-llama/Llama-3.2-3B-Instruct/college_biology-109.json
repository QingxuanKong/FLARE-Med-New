    "question": "A species of small rodent eats seeds from only one species of pine. In normal years, a pair of these rodents will have a litter of two or three. It is unusual for small rodents to have such small litter sizes. The rodents are most likely to exhibit which other characteristic?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Moderate sexual size dimorphism",
        "B": "High parental investment",
        "C": "Precocial young",
        "D": "Frequent extrapair matings"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to consider the characteristics of the species of small rodent in question. The fact that they have a small litter size (2 or 3) is unusual for small rodents, which typically have larger litters. This suggests that the species may have evolved to invest more in each individual offspring, leading to a higher parental investment. This could be an adaptation to the limited resources available in their environment, as they are specialized to eat seeds from only one species of pine. Another characteristic that is often associated with high parental investment is the presence of moderate to high sexual size dimorphism, where the males are larger than the females. This could be an adaptation to increase mating opportunities, as the males may need to compete with other males for mates. Precocial young are young that are relatively mature and mobile from birth, whereas altricial young are dependent on their parents for extended periods of time. This characteristic is not directly related to litter size, so it is less likely to be the correct answer. Frequent extrapair matings, where males mate with multiple females outside of the breeding pair bond, is a characteristic of some species, but it is not directly related to litter size. In fact, frequent extrapair matings can lead to smaller litters, as the males may not invest as much in each individual offspring. Considering these points, the most likely characteristic of the species is high parental investment, as it is closely related to the unusual litter size and the fact that they are specialized to eat seeds from only one species of pine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
