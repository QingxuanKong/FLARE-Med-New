    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's consider the complexity of the human genome and the functions of its various components. The human genome consists of approximately 3.2 billion base pairs of DNA, which are arranged into genes, regulatory regions, and non-coding DNA. While the exact percentage of the genome that encodes proteins is not precisely known, it is generally accepted that a significant portion of the genome is non-coding, but a substantial fraction of the genome does indeed encode proteins. Research has shown that approximately 1-2% of the human genome encodes proteins, but this percentage may vary depending on how one defines a protein-coding gene. However, it is widely accepted that a smaller fraction of the genome encodes proteins compared to the non-coding regions. Therefore, options C (50%) and D (90%) are unlikely to be correct. Option B (25%) is also too high. Based on the available evidence, the most accurate estimate is that approximately 2% of the human genome encodes proteins.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"A\"",
