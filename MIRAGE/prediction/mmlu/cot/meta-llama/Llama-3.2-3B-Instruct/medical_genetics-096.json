    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's evaluate each option one by one. Firstly, galactosaemia (A) is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to metabolize galactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. It can lead to elevated levels of galactose in the blood, but it's not directly associated with ammonia levels. Secondly, Hurler's syndrome (B) is a genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase, which affects the breakdown of sugar molecules. While it can lead to various metabolic problems, elevated ammonia levels are not a direct consequence of this condition. Thirdly, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency (C) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the urea cycle, which is responsible for removing ammonia from the bloodstream. A deficiency in this enzyme can lead to an accumulation of ammonia in the blood, as the body is unable to properly convert ammonia into urea. Lastly, phenylketonuria (D) is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. While it can lead to elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood, it's not directly associated with ammonia levels. Therefore, the correct answer is the condition that directly affects the urea cycle and leads to ammonia accumulation in the blood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
