    "options": {
        "A": "It is worse at rest",
        "B": "It is caused by Parkinson's Disease",
        "C": "It is indicative of a cerebellar lesion",
        "D": "Dyscalculia is a common association"

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. Intention tremor is a type of tremor that occurs when a person makes a voluntary movement, such as reaching for an object. It is characterized by a tremor that worsens as the movement approaches completion. 2. Option A states that intention tremor is worse at rest. This is incorrect because intention tremor is actually worse during voluntary movements, not at rest. 3. Option B suggests that intention tremor is caused by Parkinson's Disease. While Parkinson's Disease is a movement disorder that can cause tremors, it is more commonly associated with resting tremors, not intention tremors. 4. Option C states that intention tremor is indicative of a cerebellar lesion. This is correct because intention tremors are typically associated with damage to the cerebellum, which is responsible for coordinating voluntary movements. 5. Option D mentions dyscalculia, which is a learning disorder that affects math skills. There is no direct association between dyscalculia and intention tremor. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is option C: intention tremor is indicative of a cerebellar lesion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
