    "options": {
        "A": "Parental consanguinity",
        "B": "Male to male transmission",
        "C": "Transmission only by females",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of X-linked inheritance. X-linked inheritance occurs when a gene is located on the X chromosome. In humans, females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). A dominant gene is one that will be expressed if an individual has one copy of the gene. In X-linked dominant inheritance, the dominant gene is located on the X chromosome, and it will be expressed if an individual has even one copy of the gene. This can happen in two ways: \\n\\n1. If a female inherits the dominant gene from her mother (who is a carrier), she will express the trait. \\n2. If a female inherits the dominant gene from her father (who is not a carrier), she will also express the trait. \\n\\nNow, let's analyze the options given in the question: \\n\\nA. Parental consanguinity: This refers to the practice of marrying within the family. It is not a feature of X-linked inheritance. \\n\\nB. Male to male transmission: In X-linked inheritance, genes are transmitted from females to males, not the other way around. \\n\\nC. Transmission only by females: This is correct. In X-linked dominant inheritance, the dominant gene is transmitted from females to their offspring, whether they are male or female. \\n\\nD. Transmitted by males only to females: This is incorrect. Males can only pass their Y chromosome to their sons, not to their daughters, who inherit the X chromosome from their mother. \\n\\nSo, the correct answer is C. Transmission only by females.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
