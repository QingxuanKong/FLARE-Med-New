    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option one by one. Step 1: Duchenne muscular dystrophy is known to be caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene, which is located on the X chromosome. Since it's an X-linked disorder, it primarily affects males, who have one X and one Y chromosome. Step 2: Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A, which is encoded by the HEXA gene. This gene is located on chromosome 15, which is an autosomal chromosome, not an X chromosome. Therefore, Tay-Sachs disease does not show X-linked inheritance. Step 3: Haemophilia A and Haemophilia B are both caused by deficiencies in clotting factors, with Haemophilia A being caused by a deficiency in factor VIII and Haemophilia B being caused by a deficiency in factor IX. Both of these genes are located on the X chromosome, making Haemophilia A and Haemophilia B X-linked disorders. Step 4: Considering the above points, we can conclude that Tay-Sachs disease is the disorder that does not show X-linked inheritance. Step 5: Now, let's look at the options and select the correct answer. Based on our analysis, the correct answer is B. Tay-Sachs disease.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
