    "question": "A 20-year-old man has had frequent upper respiratory tract infections over the past 4 years. He has daily purulent sputum and has noted decreased exercise tolerance over the past 2 years. He and his wife have been unable to conceive because of his low sperm count. Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Arterial blood gas analysis",
        "B": "Examination of sputum for eosinophils",
        "C": "Sweat chloride test",
        "D": "Sputum cytology"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and physical examination: 1. Frequent upper respiratory tract infections, purulent sputum, and decreased exercise tolerance suggest a chronic respiratory condition. 2. Decreased sperm count and infertility issues in the patient and his wife suggest a possible underlying condition affecting reproductive health, which is often associated with asthma or cystic fibrosis. 3. Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi throughout both lung fields, along with hyperinflation on the chest x-ray, are classic signs of airway obstruction. 4. A decreased FEV1:FVC ratio on spirometry indicates obstructive lung disease. Given these findings, the differential diagnosis could include asthma or cystic fibrosis. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Arterial blood gas analysis can provide information about oxygenation and ventilation but is not specific for diagnosing the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. B. Examination of sputum for eosinophils is more relevant to diagnosing conditions like asthma, but it's not specific for cystic fibrosis. C. Sweat chloride test is a specific test for cystic fibrosis, as individuals with this condition often have abnormal sweat chloride levels. This test is a key diagnostic tool for cystic fibrosis, especially in patients with a family history or other suggestive clinical features. D. Sputum cytology may provide information about the presence of pathogens or inflammation but is not specific for diagnosing the underlying condition. Considering the combination of respiratory symptoms, reproductive issues, and physical examination findings, the sweat chloride test is the most likely to confirm the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, which is a condition that affects multiple systems, including the respiratory and reproductive systems.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
