    "question": "A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of intermittent blood in his stool. He has had no pain with defecation. Physical examination shows a 1-cm, visible anal mass located below the dentate line. A biopsy of the mass is scheduled. If the mass if found to be malignant, it is most appropriate to evaluate which of the following lymph nodes for possible metastasis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Internal iliac",
        "B": "Popliteal",
        "C": "Sacral",
        "D": "Superficial inguinal"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To determine the most appropriate lymph node group to evaluate for possible metastasis in this case, let's break down the steps: 1. **Location of the primary tumor**: The primary tumor is located below the dentate line, which is the anatomical boundary between the anal canal (above the dentate line) and the rectum (below the dentate line). This location is consistent with an anal cancer. 2. **Lymphatic drainage of the anal canal**: The lymphatic drainage of the anal canal is primarily to the inferior mesenteric lymph nodes, which are located in the pelvis. However, in the context of anal cancer, the lymphatic drainage can be more complex and involve both the inferior mesenteric and the external iliac lymph nodes. 3. **Anatomical considerations**: Given the location of the primary tumor, the most relevant lymph nodes to evaluate for metastasis in this case would be those that are most closely associated with the anal canal's lymphatic drainage. 4. **Options analysis**: - A. Internal iliac lymph nodes: These are part of the pelvic lymph node group that receives lymph from the rectum and anus. They are a likely candidate for evaluation. - B. Popliteal lymph nodes: These are located in the thigh and are not directly related to the lymphatic drainage of the anal canal. - C. Sacral lymph nodes: While they are in the pelvis, they are not the primary lymph nodes involved in the lymphatic drainage of the anal canal. - D. Superficial inguinal lymph nodes: These are located in the groin and are not directly involved in the lymphatic drainage of the anal canal. Considering the above steps and analysis, the most appropriate lymph nodes to evaluate for possible metastasis in this case are the internal iliac lymph nodes. ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary tumor is located below the dentate line, indicating an anal cancer.
