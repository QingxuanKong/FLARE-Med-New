    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's consider the physiological effects of intermittent high-intensity exercise on blood glucose concentration. During exercise, the body's demand for glucose increases due to the energy requirements of the muscles. However, the body's ability to utilize glucose for energy is impaired due to the increased insulin resistance caused by the exercise-induced stress response. As a result, the body starts to break down stored glycogen and release glucose into the bloodstream. This leads to a temporary increase in blood glucose concentration. Additionally, the liver also releases stored glucose through gluconeogenesis, further contributing to the increase in blood glucose levels. Therefore, during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high-intensity exercise, the blood glucose concentration is expected to rise due to the increased glucose release from stored glycogen and gluconeogenesis. Given these physiological responses, the correct answer is likely related to an increase in blood glucose concentration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
