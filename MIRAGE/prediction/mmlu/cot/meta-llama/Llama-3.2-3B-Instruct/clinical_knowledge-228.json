Lysozyme is an enzyme found in saliva, tears, and mucus. It breaks down bacterial cell walls, thereby exerting an antibacterial effect. 3. Amylase is an enzyme present in saliva that breaks down carbohydrates, but it doesn't have antibacterial properties. 4. Sodium chloride is a salt that is present in saliva, but it doesn't have antibacterial action. 5. Mucus is a thick, protective fluid produced by the mucous membranes, but it doesn't have antibacterial properties. 6. Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the correct answer is the enzyme that breaks down bacterial cell walls. Therefore, the answer is A. Lysozyme.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
