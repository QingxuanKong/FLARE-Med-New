Immunoglobulins having epsilon heavy chains. 2. Located on the plasma membranes of mast cells and basophilic leukocytes. Immunoglobulins are a class of proteins that function as antibodies in the immune system. There are five main classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. Each class has distinct characteristics. 2. IgA is primarily found in mucosal areas, such as the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts, and is not typically associated with mast cells and basophilic leukocytes. 3. IgD is mainly found on the surface of mature B cells and plays a role in starting the immune response, but it is not specifically associated with mast cells and basophilic leukocytes. 4. IgM is the first antibody produced in response to an infection and is not specifically associated with mast cells and basophilic leukocytes. 5. IgE is known to be involved in allergic reactions and is specifically associated with mast cells and basophilic leukocytes, where it binds to the high-affinity IgE receptors (Fc\u03b5RI) on the surface of these cells. When an allergen binds to the IgE, it triggers the release of histamine and other chemical mediators, leading to allergic reactions. Based on the characteristics provided in the question, IgE is the correct answer as it is the immunoglobulin that has epsilon heavy chains and is located on the plasma membranes of mast cells and basophilic leukocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
