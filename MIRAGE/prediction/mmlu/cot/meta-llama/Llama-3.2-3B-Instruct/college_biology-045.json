        "A": "They occur only in eukaryotes.",
        "B": "They represent noncoding regions.",
        "C": "They are found interspersed with exons on a region of DNA that codes for a polypeptide chain.",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze each option given in relation to the characteristics of introns. First, let's consider option A: 'They occur only in eukaryotes.' This is true, as introns are a characteristic feature of eukaryotic genes, which include plants, animals, fungi, and protists. In contrast, prokaryotes (such as bacteria) do not have introns. Next, let's consider option B: 'They represent noncoding regions.' This is also true, as introns do not code for amino acids and are removed during the splicing process, leaving only the coding regions, known as exons. Now, let's look at option C: 'They are found interspersed with exons on a region of DNA that codes for a polypeptide chain.' This is true, as introns are indeed found between exons, which are the coding regions of a gene. Lastly, let's consider option D: 'They are excised from the primary transcript before it gains a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A)tail.' This statement is incorrect regarding the fate of introns. The 5' cap and 3' poly(A)tail are added to the mature mRNA after splicing, but the introns themselves are removed during the splicing process, not added to the mRNA. Therefore, the correct answer is D, as it incorrectly states that introns are added to the primary transcript, whereas they are actually removed during splicing.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
