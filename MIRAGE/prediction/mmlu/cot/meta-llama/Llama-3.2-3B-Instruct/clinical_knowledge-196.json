    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's break down the concept of a hypertonic solution step by step: 1. **Understanding the term \"hypertonic\"**: The prefix \"hyper-\" means \"excessive\" or \"above\". In the context of solutions, it refers to a solution that has a higher concentration of solutes compared to the normal human body fluids. 2. **Normal human cell environment**: In the human body, the normal concentration of solutes in blood and other bodily fluids is slightly higher than in pure water. This is necessary for maintaining proper osmotic balance and cellular function. 3. **Definition of a hypertonic solution**: Based on the definition of the prefix \"hyper-\", a hypertonic solution is a solution that has a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell environment. Considering the above steps, let's evaluate the options: - A. **a solution that has a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell**: This option aligns with the definition of a hypertonic solution. - B. **a solution that blocks off enteral tubes easily**: This option does not relate to the definition of a hypertonic solution and is more related to the properties of a solution in terms of its interaction with medical equipment. - C. **a solution that has a lower concentration of solutes than the normal human cell**: This option is the opposite of a hypertonic solution and describes a hypotonic solution instead. - D. **a solution with a high fibre content**: This option is unrelated to the definition of a hypertonic solution and pertains to the nutritional content of a solution. Based on the step-by-step analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A hypertonic solution is defined as a solution with a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell environment. This matches option A, which states a solution that has a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
