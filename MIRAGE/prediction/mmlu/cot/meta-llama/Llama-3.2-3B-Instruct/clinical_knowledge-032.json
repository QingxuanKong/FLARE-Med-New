    "options": {
        "A": "It is a cause of ophthalmoplegia",
        "B": "It causes a large multi-nodular goitre",
        "C": "It is commoner in males than females",
        "D": "In the past, Grave's disease sometimes caused 'Derbyshire Neck'"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's consider each option step by step: 1. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism, characterized by an overproduction of thyroid hormones. It is known to cause various symptoms such as weight loss, palpitations, and exophthalmos (bulging of the eyes). 2. Ophthalmoplegia is a condition characterized by weakness or paralysis of one or more extraocular muscles that control eye movements. While Graves' disease can cause exophthalmos, it is not typically associated with ophthalmoplegia. Therefore, option A is unlikely to be correct. 3. Graves' disease often presents with a goiter, which can be diffuse or multinodular. However, the term 'large multi-nodular goitre' is more commonly associated with other conditions such as multinodular goiter or toxic multinodular goiter. Therefore, option B is not the most accurate description of Graves' disease. 4. Graves' disease is more common in females than males, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 2:1. This is because the disease is an autoimmune condition, and autoimmune diseases are more common in females due to the presence of two X chromosomes. Therefore, option C is incorrect. 5. 'Derbyshire Neck' is a term used to describe a characteristic swelling of the neck in people with Graves' disease, caused by the enlargement of the thyroid gland. This condition was more commonly seen in the past, particularly before the widespread use of radioactive iodine and surgery for thyroid disorders. Therefore, option D is correct. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
