    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down the structure and function of the bronchioles, which are the smaller airways in the lungs. The walls of the bronchioles are composed of several layers, including a respiratory epithelium, smooth muscle, and other supporting tissues. Cartilage is more commonly found in the larger airways, such as the trachea and bronchi, where it provides structural support and helps to keep the airway open. However, in the smaller bronchioles, cartilage is not typically present. Instead, the walls of bronchioles are composed of smooth muscle, which is responsible for regulating airway diameter and helping to control airflow. The respiratory epithelium, which lines the airways, plays a crucial role in gas exchange and is present in all airways, including bronchioles. Therefore, considering the options provided, the most accurate answer is the one that includes smooth muscle and respiratory epithelium, but not cartilage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
