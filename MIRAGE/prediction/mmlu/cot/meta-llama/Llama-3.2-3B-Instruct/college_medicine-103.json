    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down each option and analyze them one by one.\\n\\nOption A: 'are always harmful'. This statement is not entirely accurate. While many mutations can be harmful, some mutations may be neutral or even beneficial. For example, some beneficial mutations can provide protection against certain diseases. Therefore, option A is not the correct answer.\\n\\nOption B: 'only occur in the presence of carcinogens'. This statement is also not entirely accurate. Mutations can occur spontaneously, meaning they can happen without any external factor like carcinogens. Spontaneous mutations are more common than mutations caused by environmental factors. Therefore, option B is not the correct answer.\\n\\nOption C: 'increase tumour growth'. This statement is partially true, as some mutations can indeed contribute to cancer development and tumor growth. However, not all mutations lead to tumor growth. Many mutations are neutral or have no significant effect on the cell. Therefore, option C is not the correct answer.\\n\\nOption D: 'occur spontaneously at a low rate'. This statement is true. Spontaneous mutations occur when errors in DNA replication or repair result in changes to the genetic code. These errors are relatively rare, but they can have significant effects on the organism. This option seems to be the most accurate description of mutations.\\n\\nAnswer: D\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
