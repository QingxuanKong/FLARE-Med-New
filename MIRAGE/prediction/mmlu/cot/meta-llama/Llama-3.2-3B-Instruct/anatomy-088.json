    "options": {
        "A": "The anterior ethmoidal sinuses",
        "B": "The anterior ethmoidal and frontal sinuses",
        "C": "The anterior ethmoidal, frontal and maxillary sinuses",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's review the anatomy of the paranasal sinuses and their drainage pathways. The paranasal sinuses are air-filled cavities located within the bones around the nasal cavity. There are four pairs of paranasal sinuses: frontal, maxillary, anterior ethmoidal, and sphenoidal. The middle meatus is a critical structure in the nasal cavity that serves as the drainage pathway for the frontal, anterior ethmoidal, and maxillary sinuses. The sphenoidal sinus, on the other hand, drains into the sphenoethmoidal recess, which is located above the superior concha. With this information in mind, let's analyze the options: Option A: The anterior ethmoidal sinuses do drain into the middle meatus, but the frontal sinuses do not. So, this option is incorrect. Option B: The anterior ethmoidal and frontal sinuses do drain into the middle meatus, but the maxillary sinuses do not. So, this option is also incorrect. Option C: The anterior ethmoidal, frontal, and maxillary sinuses do all drain into the middle meatus, making this the correct answer. Option D: The anterior ethmoidal, frontal, maxillary, and sphenoidal sinuses do not all drain into the middle meatus, as the sphenoidal sinuses drain into the sphenoethmoidal recess. So, this option is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is C: The anterior ethmoidal, frontal, and maxillary sinuses.\"}",
