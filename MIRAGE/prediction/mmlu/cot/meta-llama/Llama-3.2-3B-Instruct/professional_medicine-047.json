    "question": "During a study of renal glomeruli, a healthy animal kidney is kept in a vascular bath preparation at a constant afferent arterial pressure of 100 mm Hg. If the efferent arteriole is constricted with a vascular clamp, which of the following Starling forces is most likely to change in the glomeruli?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Decreased filtration coefficient (Kf)",
        "B": "Decreased hydrostatic pressure",
        "C": "Decreased oncotic pressure",
        "D": "Increased hydrostatic pressure"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Understanding the Starling forces**: The Starling forces that influence glomerular filtration are: - Hydrostatic pressure (P) in the afferent arteriole - Hydrostatic pressure (P) in the efferent arteriole - Oncotic pressure (\u03c0) in the glomerular capillaries - Filtration coefficient (Kf) of the glomerular capillaries 2. **Given conditions**: - Constant afferent arterial pressure (P_afferent) = 100 mm Hg - Efferent arteriole is constricted (clamped), which means its pressure (P_efferent) decreases. 3. **Effect of constricting the efferent arteriole**: - When the efferent arteriole is constricted, its pressure (P_efferent) decreases. This means the hydrostatic pressure opposing filtration in the glomerulus (i.e., P_efferent) decreases. 4. **Impact on Starling forces**: - **Hydrostatic pressure (P)**: The afferent hydrostatic pressure (P_afferent) remains constant at 100 mm Hg. - **Oncotic pressure (\u03c0)**: This is not directly affected by the constriction of the efferent arteriole. - **Filtration coefficient (Kf)**: This is also not directly affected by the constriction of the efferent arteriole. 5. **Conclusion**: - The only Starling force that will change in response to constricting the efferent arteriole is the hydrostatic pressure opposing filtration in the glomerulus (P_efferent), which decreases. Here's the answer in the required json format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The efferent arteriole constriction decreases the hydrostatic pressure opposing filtration in the glomerulus (P_efferent), which is the only Starling force that will change.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" } ```",
