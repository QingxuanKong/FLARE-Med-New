    "question": "A 20-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting. She says that today she noticed a slight amount of blood in her vomit. She is a pre-med college student and admits to being under a lot of stress as she takes final exams. She also says that she drinks a large amount of coffee daily. Vital signs are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial test to order?",
    "options": {
        "A": "abdominal flat plate radiography",
        "B": "amylase level",
        "C": "complete blood count",
        "D": "urine pregnancy test"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and a slight amount of blood in her vomit, we need to consider several potential causes, including gastrointestinal issues, stress-induced gastrointestinal upset, and other non-gastrointestinal causes such as ectopic pregnancy or pancreatitis. The patient's history of being a pre-med college student and her daily coffee consumption could also be contributing factors. The patient's vital signs are normal, which suggests that there is no immediate indication of severe dehydration or shock. The first step is to rule out pregnancy, as it is a potential cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in a young female. The patient's age and symptoms make this a reasonable consideration. The urine pregnancy test is a quick and non-invasive test that can provide a rapid result. The other options, while potentially relevant, are not the most appropriate initial tests. Abdominal flat plate radiography (A) may be useful in evaluating gastrointestinal issues such as bowel obstruction or free air under the diaphragm, but it is not the first line of testing in this scenario. Amylase level (B) may be useful in evaluating pancreatitis, but the patient's symptoms do not strongly suggest pancreatitis. A complete blood count (C) may be useful in evaluating for signs of infection or inflammation, but it is not the most appropriate initial test in this scenario. Therefore, the most appropriate initial test to order is the urine pregnancy test (D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
