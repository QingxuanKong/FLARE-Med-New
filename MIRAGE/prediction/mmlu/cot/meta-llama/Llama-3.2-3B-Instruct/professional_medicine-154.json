    "question": "A 40-year-old man comes to the office for a preemployment physical examination. The patient has been generally healthy. Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no routine medications. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows a palpable nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is within the reference range. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland confirms a solid, 1-cm nodule. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?",
    "options": {
        "A": "CT scan of the neck",
        "B": "Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule",
        "C": "Radionuclide thyroid scan",
        "D": "Thyroidectomy"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate next step in evaluation for this patient, we need to consider the size and location of the thyroid nodule, as well as the patient's thyroid function. First, the patient has a solid, 1-cm nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland, which is within the normal size range. The serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration is within the reference range, indicating that the patient's thyroid function is normal. Next, we need to consider the potential risks and benefits of each diagnostic option. A CT scan of the neck (Option A) may provide additional information about the nodule, such as its relationship to surrounding structures, but it is not the first step in evaluating a thyroid nodule. Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule (Option B) is a commonly used method for evaluating thyroid nodules, but it should be performed by a healthcare professional with experience in thyroid ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNAC). A radionuclide thyroid scan (Option C) can help determine if the nodule is functioning (hot, warm, or cold), but it is not the best initial step in evaluating a solid nodule. Thyroidectomy (Option D) is a surgical procedure to remove the thyroid gland and is generally reserved for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, such as in cases of thyroid cancer or thyroiditis. It is not the first step in evaluating a solid thyroid nodule. Given these considerations, the most appropriate next step in evaluation is to have a healthcare professional with experience in thyroid ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNAC) of the nodule. This will provide a sample of the nodule for histopathological examination to determine if it is benign or malignant. Therefore, the answer is B. Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
