    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, let's break down the information provided and analyze each option step by step. 1. The question mentions'sight organs' and 'ommatidia', which are specific terms related to the visual system of crustaceans and insects. 2. Ommatidia are known to be the basic building blocks of the compound eye in arthropods, such as insects and crustaceans. 3. The term 'compound eye' refers to an eye that is made up of many individual units or ommatidia, each of which contains a lens, retina, and cornea. 4. A simple eye, on the other hand, is a type of eye that consists of a single lens and a retina, and is typically found in simple organisms like flatworms. 5. Eyespots are not a recognized term in the context of visual anatomy. 6. Binocular eyes are a type of eye that has two separate eyes, each with its own lens and retina, allowing for depth perception, but this is not a characteristic of the visual organs in crustaceans and insects. 7. Given the information about ommatidia and the definition of compound eyes, the correct answer can be deduced. 8. Therefore, the sight organs of crustaceans and insects contain ommatidia, which make up the individual visual units of a compound eye.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
