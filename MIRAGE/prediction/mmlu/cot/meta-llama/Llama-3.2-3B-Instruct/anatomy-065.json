    "options": {
        "A": "The muscles of mastication",
        "B": "The muscles of mastication and anterior belly of digastric",
        "C": "The muscles of mastication and anterior and posterior bellies of digastric",
        "D": "The muscles of mastication, anterior and posterior bellies of digastric and geniohyoid"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to recall the embryological development of the muscles of the head and neck. The first pharyngeal arch, also known as the mandibular arch, is responsible for the development of several muscles. The muscles of mastication (chewing) are primarily derived from the first pharyngeal arch. These include the temporalis, masseter, medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid, and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. The digastric muscle has two bellies: the anterior belly and the posterior belly. The geniohyoid muscle is also derived from the first pharyngeal arch. Therefore, the correct answer should include the muscles of mastication and the anterior and posterior bellies of the digastric muscle, as well as the geniohyoid muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
