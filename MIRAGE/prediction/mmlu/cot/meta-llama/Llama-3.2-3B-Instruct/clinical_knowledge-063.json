    "options": {
        "A": "It affects males more than females",
        "B": "If telangiectasia are seen this clinches the diagnosis",
        "C": "Arachnodactyly is a feature of the disease",
        "D": "Patients have a beaked shaped nose and waxy skin"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's evaluate each option step by step. 1. Systemic sclerosis, also known as scleroderma, is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis and thickening of the skin and internal organs. It primarily affects females, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 9:1. This suggests that option A is incorrect. 2. Telangiectasias, which are dilated blood vessels, can be seen in various conditions, including systemic sclerosis. However, their presence alone is not a definitive diagnostic criterion for systemic sclerosis. Therefore, option B is not a clincher for the diagnosis. 3. Arachnodactyly, or fingered hands and feet, is a characteristic feature of systemic sclerosis. It is caused by the deposition of collagen in the skin and joints, leading to joint stiffness and deformities. This option appears to be true. 4. Patients with systemic sclerosis may experience skin changes, but a 'beaked-shaped nose' is not a typical description of the skin changes in this disease. The skin may become thickened and hardened, leading to a leathery texture, but this does not usually result in a beaked appearance. Therefore, option D is incorrect. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is C: Arachnodactyly is a feature of the disease.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
