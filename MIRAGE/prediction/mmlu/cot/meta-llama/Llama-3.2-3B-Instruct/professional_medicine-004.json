    "question": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of numbness in her right hand. During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Median nerve at the wrist",
        "B": "Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm",
        "C": "Radial nerve at the forearm",
        "D": "Ulnar nerve at the elbow"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and physical examination: 1. The patient presents with numbness and tingling in the right ring and small fingers, which suggests involvement of a nerve that supplies these areas. 2. The patient has no history of serious illness or medication use, which makes it less likely that her symptoms are caused by a systemic condition. 3. She works as a cashier and uses a computer, which may involve repetitive motions, but this is not directly related to the specific areas of numbness. 4. Her history of playing softball as a pitcher may be relevant, as it involves repetitive throwing motions that can lead to nerve compression. 5. The examination reveals severe pain with palpation of the right elbow, which is a classic sign of nerve compression at this location. 6. The sensory deficits are localized to the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger, which is consistent with the distribution of the ulnar nerve. Given these points, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow, also known as cubital tunnel syndrome. This condition occurs when the ulnar nerve is compressed as it passes through the cubital tunnel at the elbow, leading to numbness, tingling, and pain in the areas supplied by the nerve. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Ulnar nerve at the elbow.\"}",
