    "question": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 2-day history of a sore throat and fever that peaks in the late afternoon. He also has a 1-week history of progressive fatigue. He recently began having unprotected sexual intercourse with one partner. He appears ill. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Physical examination shows cervical lymphadenopathy and pharyngeal erythema with a creamy exudate. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Candidiasis",
        "B": "Herpangina",
        "C": "Infectious mononucleosis",
        "D": "Mumps"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this case, let's consider the patient's symptoms and history. The patient is a 14-year-old boy presenting with a sore throat, fever that peaks in the late afternoon, and progressive fatigue. These symptoms are suggestive of an infectious process. The presence of cervical lymphadenopathy and pharyngeal erythema with a creamy exudate further supports this. The patient's recent history of unprotected sexual intercourse is also a significant risk factor for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The patient's symptoms, particularly the fever that peaks in the late afternoon, are consistent with a viral infection. Among the options provided, infectious mononucleosis is a viral infection caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) that often presents with fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy, making it a strong candidate for the diagnosis. Herpangina is typically caused by coxsackieviruses and presents with painful vesicles, which is not described in this case. Candidiasis is a fungal infection that typically presents with white patches or plaques on the mucous membranes, which is not consistent with the creamy exudate described in this case. Mumps is a viral infection that primarily affects the parotid glands, which is not the primary focus of this patient's symptoms. Considering these factors, the most likely diagnosis is infectious mononucleosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
